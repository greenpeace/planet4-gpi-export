	Are sustainable, legal fisheries the latest trend in the frozen food section of your supermarket?  Industry authority Intrafish certainly thinks so.  Not only have several supermarket chains and frozen seafood companies started to scrutinize where their fish is coming from, but in the Pacific four companies were recently fined for illegal fishing - a good step toward Making Piracy History.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists scale the Swedish headquarters of frozen food giant Findus after a documentary exposed their dealings with illegal fisheries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.intrafish.no/global/" target="_blank"&gt;Intrafish&lt;/a&gt; reported recently that
Europeansupermarket giant Asda, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?CFID=3485438&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=49507146&amp;amp;ucidparam=20060117140500&amp;amp;MenuPoint=H-A" target="_blank"&gt;after we protested on their
rooftops&lt;/a&gt;,droppedskate, Dover sole, ling and dogfish from its
shelves, and pledged todevelop a sustainable seafood policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish frozen food firm Findus dropped one of their suppliers
afterthe firm was &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/findus-fires-fishy-suppliers/"&gt;
linked with illegal cod fishing&lt;/a&gt; As part of the samecontroversy,
Scandinavian retailers initiated audits of suppliers,including
Espersen (which supplies, for example, McDonald's in manyEuropean
countries), to determine if illegal cod was getting into
theirproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. retailers Sainsbury's, Coop, Tesco, Somerfield, Waitrose
andMorrisons have all delisted suspicious species, in some cases
includingthe very vulnerable big-eye tuna. Intrafish's verdict:
"There's beeneven more shifts and sustainability pledges that could
easily be linkedto this trend. My guess? We've only just
begun."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in March the UK Government announced new funding of about
US$1million to help support an international initiative to deal
with piratefishing. Meanwhile in the Pacific, France, Australia and
New Zealandsigned a declaration on maritime surveillance in a bid
to strengthenthe fight against piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team leader in Fiji, Nilesh Goundar, was
enthusiastic.  "Hopefully we should see the benefits of practical
help provided toPacifc Island countries who, because of resource
contraints andcompeting development priorities, could not allocate
sufficientresources to deal with the plague of pirate fishing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, three foreign boat captains were fined
US$102,564 for illegally fishing off Clipperton Island, a
Frenchpossession, and a Fiji based company was fined $30,000 for
allowing aforeign vessel to illegally fish in Fiji waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have our friends at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons/sealord"&gt;
Sealord&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
Gorton's&lt;/a&gt;caught on to the trend of responsible, sustainable
fisheries? Well Sealord CEO Doug MacKay was on New Zealand radio
last monthoffering to "be the middleman" between us and Nissui, and
the BostonGlobe reported a Gorton's spokesperson saying "Gorton's
has stronglyencouraged Nissui to use whatever influence they have
to appeal to theJapanese government to stop whaling… We have also
asked them to severany connections they might have with the
Japanese government's whalingprogram."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these few signs mean that someone is doing the right
thing,Nissui's refusal to give an inch means that Gorton's and
Sealord remaintied to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
Japan'scommercial whaling operation&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
piratefishing&lt;/a&gt; still accounts for 20 percent of the global
catch,netting the illegal fishermen and their company bosses
somewherebetween US$4-9 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If governments are really serious about making piracy history
then theyneed to act on a grand scale, working together to protect
the high seasand coastal communities from those pirate companies
who think nothingabout stealing food from others and smuggling them
onto the market. Youcan send that message loud and clear by &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;signing up
asan Ocean Defender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender and help make piracy history.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GreenNewBlack"&gt;Help us continue to expose the companies involved in pirate fishing around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	John Lundberg, a professional cropcircle maker talks about his latest work, a giant question mark in a maize field in Mexico and working with us. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mexico-crop-circle1.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists protest against the contamination of Mexico's maize supply from genetically engineered maize.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For years I'd thought that crop circles would be an ideal
medium forpromoting Greenpeace's genetic engineering (GE) campaign.
The cropcircles generate an alien mystique, encouraging people to
consider theunknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/"&gt;
GE campaign&lt;/a&gt; aims to prevent alien organisms from contaminating
ourplants and food, while raising awareness of the unknown
consequencesthat could arise from such material entering the food
chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiscombination of mystery, creativity and an underlying message
perfectlyreflects the work that Greenpeace is doing worldwide. It
was alsoembodied in the formation we created for them - a 65 meter
(200 feet)circle with a question mark at its centre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why a question mark?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Forthousands of years, maize (corn) has been an essential food
for thepeople of Mexico; it also plays an integral part in their
culture andreligion. Unfortunately, in recent years the maize has
been tainted byGE varieties entering the country and being planted
by unaware farmers.As a result, normally GE-free maize is showing
signs of geneticcontamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question mark conveys a simple message -contamination is
happening, but nobody knows exactly where it is takingplace, nor
where it could lead for the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after our crop circle creation we were transported to a
tiny village called Cuanajo in the state of Michoacan. A
celebration was held to honour the regions GE free status. The
festival was an amazing cultural experience, each type of maize has
a purpose. Maize for tortillas, tamales, atoles, pozole, animal
feed and also to create handcrafts which they sell in market
stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting this precious diversity is paramount for the people,
regional government, scientists and environmental groups who have
all worked together to cement the region as GE free. Other
surrounding regions are also interested in following this example
to create their own GE free zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themore I find out about the issues surrounding GE, especially
withinMexico, the happier I am to have been involved in this
project. Withliterally thousands of different strains of maize in
Mexico, it'svitally important for both its people, and the rest of
the world, tokeep the seeds clean and maintain their variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-mexico/"&gt;Greenpeace in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;
was a rewarding and fun experience - even duringthe rainy season!
Circlemakers hope to continue our relationship withGreenpeace and I
also hope that Mexico can successfully rid itself ofgenetic
contamination and keep its maize GE-free."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Ending the days of plunder: halting the pirates</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/halting-pirates/</url><text>
	Blacklisted trawlers, swapping flags and changing names… but they couldn’t plunder the high seas today.  In the German harbour of Rostock, four pirate fishing boats awoke to find themselves hemmed in by chains and oil drums.  One is now displaying not just a new flag, but a new banner reading “Stop pirate fishing”, courtesy of Greenpeace activists. A fifth trawler escaped in the night.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/3/greenpeace-activists-prevented.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/3/greenpeace-activists-prevented.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists prevent four pirate fishing trawlers from leaving Rostock harbour. The ships were involved in the collapse of redfish stocks in the North Atlantic in 2005.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've already called on the German government in the past to
preventthese same fishing vessels leaving port. Back in December
last year,they were called the Oyra, Ostroe, Okhotino, Olchan and
Ostrovets. In2005, they were involved in the collapse of the
redfish stocks of theNorth Atlantic. Now their owners have changed
the ships' registrationsand they're named like a Spanish chorus
line: Eva, Junita, Rosita,Isabella and Carmen, and are registered
to a new flag state: Georgia.But the German government didn't stop
them setting out again, so wedid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea Cederquist, marine biologist at Greenpeace Germany,says
the fact that the German government allows known pirate
fishingvessels to set sail is incredible. "Knowing these ships are
leavingport without making sure they will keep to international
fisheryagreements in future is unacceptable," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Box blue"&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - The One That Didn't GetAway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under cover of darkness, the fifth vessel inthe blacklisted fleet sneakedaway to Poland. Our activists have paid a visit to the Carmen, in the portof Swinoujscie, wrappingit in chains and hanging a banner that reads "Stop PirateFishing".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TheCarmen is currently in dry dock, presumably in preparation for anotherbout of pirate fishing. As in Germany, where the sister vessels wereillegally re-supplied, the Polish government are so far ignoring theirobligation to prevent the Carmen from re-supplying, despite its beingblacklisted for repeated breaches of European, north east and northwest Atlantic fishing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have obtained information indicating that these trawlers have
settheir sights on either plundering the rich fishing waters off
the coastof West Africa (Mauritania) or going farther afield to
trawl the depthsof the Pacific. Both are regions where proper
controls are lacking andpirate fishing is flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
Pirate fisheries&lt;/a&gt;are estimated to cost countries between 3.4 and
7.6 billion euros eachyear. They also wipe-out the unknown worlds
of the deep-sea. Manypirate vessels are engaged in a fishing
technique called &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/bottom-trawling/"&gt;
bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;which is known to cause huge destruction to
vulnerable deep-sea marinelife such as cold water corals. Over the
next few months, inpartnership with the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/bottom-trawling/" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Justice Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,our ship the
Esperanza will expose how fishing pirates in the Atlanticare wiping
out marine life and destroying the livelihoods of thecommunities
dependent on our oceans for food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what needs to be done to stop this? Our Oceans Campaigner
SariTolvanen thinks governments should put their money where their
mouth is- and now. "They need to stop these boats from leaving port
and supporta United Nations moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling. This wouldsend a signal to pirates that their days of
plundering the oceans areover," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a signal to governments everywhere and &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;sign up as
an Ocean Defender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=HaltingPirates"&gt;Help us stop more pirate fishing and convince governments to act to bring about a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Pirate fishing: it ain't pretty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks, we may have seemed a bit quiet. But now
we cantell youwe've been working undercover with a team from the
human rights groupEnvironmentalJustice Foundation (EJF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in West African waters, we have unmasked a trail of
piratefishing and stolen food leading directly from Africa into
Europe andbeyond. In partnership  with the Environmental Justice
Foundation, wehave unmasked 61 pirate vessels that are stealing
food from a poorcountry that is losing millions of dollars a year
in stolen fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From on board the Esperanza, we havedocumented 61
foreign-flagged vessels in the waters of West Africa. Ofthese, 19
had been involved in illegal fishing activities in the past.An
additional 21 could not be identified, as their names were
hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Guinean enforcement officials, with powers of arrest,
havenow joined the Esperanza, which will continue to carry out
surveillanceoperations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five unidentified vessels were spotted in waters inside
theGuinean 12 milezone - waters reserved for local fishermen. Local
fishermen simplycannot compete with these pirate ships. They have
been forced, often inunstable canoes, to fish further and further
from shore. Collisions arenot uncommon. Legitimate local fishermen
have died while the piratescontinue to steam further inshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also witnessed an illegal transfer of fish from
twovessels to a largerefrigerated vessel, or reefer. (Guinea
outlawed such transhipmentslast year.) Transhipping is one of the
major ways in which piratefishing fleets hide their catches and
launder them through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West Africa is the only region in the world where
fishconsumption is falling. According to an estimate from the the
UKDepartment for International Development, cash and food starved
nationslike Guinea are losing US$100 million each year in stolen
fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, pirate fishing is worth billions of USdollars a
year - 20 percent of the total fish catch. It is estimatedthat just
in sub-Saharan Africa it nets US$1billion dollars annually,while in
the waters of the Southern Ocean, up to 50 percent of thevaluable
Patagonian Toothfish may come from illegal activities. In theBaltic
Sea 40 percent of the cod caught in 2002 - 2003 was estimated
tohave been illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that pirate fishing is devastating to oceanlife
and the livelihood of some of the world's poorest people, notenough
is being done to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helene Bours of the EJF said, "It is complete hypocrisy for
governments to talk aboutencouraging aid to Africa at the same time
as allowing the food and income theyneed to be stolen."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Oceans Campaigner onboard, Sarah Duthie, said the
solutionmust come from governments taking action such as closing
ports topirate fishing vessels and making sure companies are
prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us to ensure that governments stop just talking about
pirates and workactively to &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;make piracy
history&lt;/a&gt; - sign up now as an Ocean Defender.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first light this morning, the Greenpeace helicopter flew over
agroup of fishing vessels 60 miles off the coast of Guinea. One was
noton the list of ships authorized to fish. An inflatable boat
waslaunched from the Greenpeace ship M.Y Esperanza, taking a
Guinean Navyofficer and a fisheries inspector with crew from
Greenpeace and theEnvironmental Justice Foundation on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After confirming the ship, the Lian Run No 14 - one of afamily
of Chinese vessels observed in the area - had no license, theship
was arrested. The Esperanza will now escort her to Conakry andhand
her over to officials on shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain of the Lian Run No 14 claimed documentation
waslodged in Las Palmas - the fish laundering capital of the world.
Inaddition, all the boxes being used to pack the stolen fish bore
thenames of other vessels, proving that even licensed vessels
collaboratewith the pirates to sell illegally caught fish on the
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish boxes with the names of seven other vessels were found
onboard the Lian Run No 14, proving how licensed vessels are
packingtheir boxes with illegal catch from the Lian Run No 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that they had boxes on board destined for Europe
andclaimed to be represented in Las Palmas shows a clear link
between thefood being stolen from Africa and the fish being served
on the dinnertables of Europe," said Helene Bours of the
Environmental JusticeFoundation.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a show of consumer power, Scandinavian frozen food giant Findus has agreed to stop selling illegally caught fish. The people at Findus immediately responded when their company's dealings with pirate fisheries were exposed on Swedish national TV.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/activists-scale-the-swedish-he.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/activists-scale-the-swedish-he.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists scaled frozen food giant Findus' headquarters to expose their dealings with pirate fisheries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We helped show the path by which fishillegally caught in the
Barents Sea ended up as the viewer's fishdinner. It's estimated
that piratefisheries account for around 30 percent of the cod
caught in theBarents Sea and 40 percent of the catch in the Baltic
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findus, who produce a large range of popular frozen fish
products,wereshown to be sourcing illegally caught fish from the
Barents Sea. Also documented were thestrong ties between Findus and
dubious seafood companies including thelargeDanish fish-trader
Kangamiut and China-based seafood giant PacificAndes (alleged to
have strong links to illegal fishing in theSouthern Ocean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning after the show's screening, we turned up at Findus
International headquarters in Sweden  todemand an end to their
dodgy fish dealing. Our activists told Findusthey must guarantee
that all their fish products come from legalcatches and not from
depleted or unsustainably managed fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;No floundering: Findus does the right thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findus were quick to react to our demands, promising to break
offtheir contracts with the identified procurers of illegal fish
(DanishgiantKangamiut), and to contract an outside auditor to
review the sourcingpolicy of their othersuppliers. The company also
initiated a "joint Swedish strategy" with the Swedish fish industry
to help combat illegal fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to theNorwegian government about 100,000 tonnes of cod
are illegally caught inthe Barents Sea each year. The United
Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization saythat over 70 percent of
the world's commercial fish stocks arefully exploited,
over-exploited, or depleted. Illegal fisheries are abig problem
that's only getting bigger -- effective measures need to betaken
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consumer power: pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By pressuring food suppliers to act responsibly we can help
ensure thatthe food we eat is not contributing to the destruction
of our fisheriesand oceans. As &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/defenders"&gt;Ocean Defenders&lt;/a&gt;,
we can change the way internationalcompanies like Findus work, and
on a global scale this can really makea difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Findus just the threat of customers viewing their brand
negatively made them take immediate action. Isn't itamazing how
much power we consumers really have, especially when we speak with
one voice.&lt;/p&gt;

	The inflatable boats have been hauled in.  The crew is exhausted, the ships need fuel, and it's time to take the campaign to save the whales from the high seas to the High Street, (or from the bounding main to the Main street, if you're North American).
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            44 activists from the Greenpeace ships Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise spell out a personal appeal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists like Texas, Andrew, Lally, Nathan, Mikey, Phil and all
theother folks you've come to know through the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Oceans Defenders
weblog&lt;/a&gt;have done all they can.  They've saved whales. 
They'veslowed down the hunt.  They've alerted millions of people
aroundthe world to the whale killing they've witnessed in the
SouthernOcean.  Now it's up to all of us to act on what
they'veshown us -- and finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've spent 61 days at sea, half of them in front of
theharpoons.  We've broken and fixed every boat we have at
leastonce.  We've been rammed. We've had explosive harpoons fired
overour heads.  Our activists have risked their lives in the
freezingAntarctic waters and spent their holiday season away from
family andloved ones for the chance to save a whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a message from expedition leader Shane Rattenbury, to you
oceandefenders and all who have been part of this exciting campaign
for thelast few months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Logistically we cannot remain in the Southern Ocean any longer, but this certainly isn't the last you'll hear of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The 57 crew on both Greenpeace ships want to thank everyone who hassupported our work down here by writing letters of support tonewspapers and websites, and also to thank our millions of individualfinancial supporters around the world. It's thanks to our new fastership, the Esperanza, that we were able to keep up with the whalers thewhole time, and we couldn't be down here without that support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;For a month now we have dogged, delayed and disrupted the whaling fleetin the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and have no doubt that they havefallen far behind in their bid to slaughter 935 minke whales and 10endangered fin whales. It is our hope that this struggle will inspirepeople to help us defend whales, so that it goes down in history as thelast time the peaceful silence in the Sanctuary is broken by the soundof a grenade-tipped harpoon.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
Whaling is not just the concern of governments and cryptic
politicalmeetings. There is big business involved. While whaling is
notprofitable, you might be surprised to learn of some famous
seafoodcompanies' connections to whaling. We're asking you to help
us make thewhaling stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies outside Japan are owned by, or have contracts
with,Nissui,  the corporation which owns one third of Kyodo
Senpaku,which owns the whalingfleet.  We aim to  expose exactly how
whalers profit from thefish you buy, and demand  those companies
disassociate themselvesfrom whaling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissui need to know that whaling is bad forbusiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up as an &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Ocean
Defender&lt;/a&gt;, we'll sendyou ongoing information about who these 
companies are and how youcan pressure them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/a-victory-for-the-whales130106/"&gt;
Already in Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, activists have convinced a popular
seafoodcompany  to cancel contracts with Nissui corporation. 
Injust 2  days over 21,000 cyberactivists contacted the company
anddownloaded  stickers to place on Santa Elena products
insupermarkets, to highlight  that the company was implicated in
thekilling of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, we've hit &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
whaler-owned seafood giant Gorton&lt;/a&gt;s with nearly  40,000 letters
from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2008266"&gt;
Europe, Nissui&lt;/a&gt; is being hammered with pressure to use
itsone-third  ownership of Kyodo Senpaku to pressure for a shut
downof the whaling fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we continue to pressure those targets, we're opening
anew front with &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/campaigns/oceans/sealord-and-whaling.asp"&gt;
Sealord&lt;/a&gt;, a New Zealand-based fishing company thatis 50% owned
by Nissui.  Sealord sells toseafood  distributors all over the
world, and we'll be targettingproducts that  whalers profit from
wherever they're sold. You can &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/action/email-sealord.asp"&gt;send a
message&lt;/a&gt; to Sealord now.&lt;/p&gt;

	We've been here before: the Southern Ocean, the Japanese whaling fleet, Greenpeace defending the lives of whales in the face of so called "scientific whaling". And in true de ja vu style, the whalers are once again accusing Greenpeace of recklessness -- after one of their catcher ships, the Kyo-maru, rammed our vessel Esperanza. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2005/12/japanese-whaling-fleet-catcher.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japanese whaling fleet catcher ship Kyo Maru No.1 heads towards the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; On 08 January 2006, the whalers rammed our ship the Arctic Sunrise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/whalers_ram_greenpeace"&gt;Read all the details here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Kamp, the captain of the Esperanza said: "Regarding the
Kyo-maru,the catcher hit the Esperanza. The Esperanza was on the
steady coursebehind the Nisshin Maru. The Kyo Maru approached the
Esperanza from thestern on the port side. The Kyo Maru  was obliged
byInternational Collision legislation to give way to the Esperanza,
asthey came from behind. They came close then moved toward us and
madecontact on our port side. We have kept steady course the whole
time.The Esperanza suffered no damage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar incident in 1999, (oddly on exactly the same day,
December21st) the same tactic was attempted by the whalers.  To
this day,Lloyds List, which is the definitive resource on maritime
incidents,puts the blame squarely on the Japanese whaling
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace puts the utmost emphasis on safety. Our crew are
thoroughlytrained and equipped to ensure the  safe operations
underdangerous conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same whalers who call their whaling programme
"scientificresearch"  (despite the fact that the International
WhalingCommission has termed the programme scientifically useless) 
wantyou to believe that Greenpeace is reckless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's rhetoric, and there's reality.&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning our ship the Arctic Sunrise was deliberately rammed and damaged by the Nisshin Maru, the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet. Straight after the ramming, the Nisshin Maru began to steam away from the "scene of the crime". However both the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza are in pursuit with every intention of continuing to peacefully protest the hunt.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Damage to the bow of the Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise following a collision with the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet, Nisshin Maru. The Nisshin Maru cut across the bow of the Arctic Sunrise, causing the collision. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking from onboard the Arctic Sunrise, expedition leader
ShaneRattenbury said, "There is no way to describe this as anything
but adeliberate ramming which placed the safety of our ship and the
lives ofour crew in severe danger." The Nisshin Maru is more than
twice as longand six times heavier than the Arctic Sunrise. The
impact has left theSunrise "battered and bruised" but luckily no
crew members were injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/whalers_ram_greenpeace"&gt;All the
details here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight the Nisshin Maru had been offloading accumulated whale
meatontoa supply vessel and early this morning our activists, in
inflatables,began to paint the words "whale meat from sanctuary" on
the side of thesupply ship. This action in no way impeded the
transfer of the meat andthe tiny inflatables did not represent a
threat to either vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the activists completed painting the slogan, the Nisshin
Marusuddenlydisengaged from the supply vessel coming around a full
360 degreesbeforemaking for the Arctic Sunrise, which was about a
kilometre away, andstriking it on the port side. The captain of the
Sunrise tried to pullout of the way of the oncoming whaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on December 21, when the catcher ship the Kyo Maru bumped
theEsperanza, the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR)
said "thesame thing occurred five years ago when in 1999 another
collisionoccurred between Japan's research vessels and a Greenpeace
vessel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was the Nisshin Maru, not the Arctic Sunrise, which
was atfault for the collision in December 1999 also, as officially
recordedin the Lloyd's database (the international record of
maritime movementsand casualties). International maritime law
states that "any vesselovertaking any other shall keep out of the
way of the vessel beingovertaken."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Watch video of the incident:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have repeatedly informed the whaling fleet and its
controllingorganisation in Tokyo, the Institute for Cetacean
Research, of our peacefulintentions and explained the purpose of
the protest against the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the ramming, we are not going to be deterred. "No
amount ofbullying or intimidation will prevent us from defending
the whales, norfrom broadcasting images of the kills to the world,"
said Shane.&lt;/p&gt;

	The crews of the Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise are once again in action in the Southern Ocean after 10 days of no whales being killed. Expedition leader Shane Rattenbury said: "We caught up with the whalers again late last night and saw seven whale carcasses on the deck. Four activists in an inflatable boat are on the water, near the Kyo Maru catcher ship, acting to defend the whales caught in the sights of the harpoons."

        &lt;p&gt;
            Friday 6 January - The action in the Southern Ocean continues as activists follow the trail of blood left by a harpooned minke whale being taken for processing.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Esperanza crew saw at least 4 more dead whales being
transferred from the two catchers today," added Shane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On December 21, the longest day of the year in the Southern
Ocean, after a month at sea &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whalers-found/"&gt;we
found&lt;/a&gt;the Japanese whaling fleet. For the first few days it was
all hands ondeck and all inflatables in the water as we blocked the
harpooner'sline of sight and defended whales and as we slowed the
transfer ofwhales from the catchers to the fleets factory ship the
Nisshin Maru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/01/everybody_goes.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25401/slideshow_action050106.jpg" height="39" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mikey, an Australian activist, earned himself the reputation of
"whale rider" as he &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/eye_to_eye_with.html"&gt;
heroically clung to a dead whale&lt;/a&gt;,brandishing a "Stop Whaling"
banner while being blasted with firehoses."I must admit the look of
dismay I had on my face when I looked up atthe whaling crew and
they were looking down with smugness andlaughter," he wrote in our
weblog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/bearing_witness_1.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25401/slideshow_03.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crews sent &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/bearing_witness_1.html"&gt;
stunning photographs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tvyil.greenpeaceweb.org/default.asp?loadfilm=55&amp;amp;loadcat=10"&gt;
video footage&lt;/a&gt; to the world. Some of that footage was analysed
by the &lt;a href="http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=158254"&gt;International
Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt;(IFAW). IFAW scientist and whale expert
Vassili Papastavrou, whowatched the footage, said: "We were told by
Greenpeace this whale took10 minutes to die. This is how a whale
was killed when the boats werebeing observed, so what happens when
they're not being seen?"&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, in an unprecedented move, the whaling fleet fled. We have
been tothe Southern Ocean seven times to halt whaling in the past,
and thiswas the first time that we kept a fleet on the run for
several days.But this is also the first time that we have had our
fastest ship, theEsperanza, in the Southern Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese ships fledalmost 2,000 nautical miles (3,700km)
over the past 11 days, putting atemporary stop to their whaling
operations. The fleet may now be undereven more pressure to meet
their quota. Shane said, "We lost track ofthe fleet for about 24
hours after they refuelled, but we are back inplace ready to ensure
they don't meet their new whaling quota of 935minke and 10 fin
whales."&lt;/p&gt;

	High-seas bottom trawling is destroying deep-sea habitats before we even know about them. For the umpteenth time in the last three years, politicians are meeting to discuss (maybe) doing something about it. While they talk deep-sea destruction is occurring every day on the high seas.

	In the remote Paradise Forests of Papua New Guinea, illegal and destructive logging continues to threaten both the local communities and the fragile ecosystem. So we have launched a major initiative to help indigenous communities establish their rights to the land they have called home for generations.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            'Mud men' perform traditional dances to welcome the arrival of the Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow Warrior in Port Moresby's harbour. Greenpeace launches a major initiative to help protect Asia Pacific's last remaining ancient rainforests - the 'Paradise Forests - by unveiling its Global Forest Rescue Station in a remote part of Papua New Guinea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the invitation of the local communities, we have established
the&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/gfrs/"&gt;
Global Forest Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; (GFRS) on the western edge of Lake
Murray,deep in the Paradise Forests. From the GFRS, our activists
from aroundthe world will help members of the Kuni, Begwa and Pari
tribes mark outthe boundaries of their lands to protect it from
loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Locate the &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/gfrsblog.kmz"&gt;Global
Forest Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; (GFRS) using Google Earth - click &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to download Google
Earth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Althoughin Papua New Guinean law, 97 percent of the land is
recognised as beingowned by the customary landowners who live
there, many tribalboundaries have never been officially recorded.
Until this is done theland is effectively up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With large-scale industriallogging, the local communities see
very little of the huge profitsgenerated by the logging and the
forest cannot sustain the level ofdestruction. For each tree felled
for timber at least seventeen othersare destroyed, not to mention
the impact on the diverse wildlife thatthe forest support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Ourforest is like
a supermarket and our survival depends on the forest.The forest
gives us our homes, our food and our medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Sep Galeva, Kuni clan leader&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butthere is a solution. Boundary marking, also known as
demarcation, isthe first step in allowing the local communities to
use the forest inecologically sustainable ways that doesn't destroy
the forest. The GFRSwill be used as a base camp to help the local
communities mark outaround 300,000 hectares of their lands in the
Lake Murray region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheStation isn't just about mapping out land boundaries. Part of
the workdone there will be to promote small-scale community
enterprises thathelp maintain the forest and bring greater benefits
to the communitiesthat live there such as eco-forestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of wholesaledestruction of the forest with large
machines to extract the timber,portable equipment is used to
minimise the impact. Trees are milledwhere they fall and are
carried along bush trails and floated out alongrivers, and then
strict guidelines and monitoring allow the forest toregenerate
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profits from this method of forestry forlocal communities
are also much more than those that trickle down fromthe logging
companies, between four to 10 times greater, all of whichis shared
among the local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with community-basedsolutions the Global Rescue Forest
Station will help protect the uniquebiodiversity of Papua New
Guinea. With only one percent of the forestsunder any kind of
protection, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

	Armed and masked, scouring the oceans, stealing food from hungry families – modern day pirates are a far cry from the glamour of Hollywood movies. But they are a multi billion-dollar reality for many communities that can least afford to be robbed. The Esperanza sets out to foil the pirates.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Illegal longliner with it's crew standing on deck wearing balaclavas to cover their identity, the crew are attempting to fish illegally in Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending 70 days at sea confronting the whaling fleets in
theSouthern Ocean, the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/"&gt;Esperanza is setting sail
for the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; - thistime to expose the modern day pirates
who steal fish from the poorestnations and leave a trail of
environmental destruction in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stolen fish, stolen futures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could that fish on your dinner plate be stolen? On this next leg
of ouryear-long expedition, we are working with the &lt;a href="http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html"&gt;Environmental
JusticeFoundation&lt;/a&gt;. Together we are are demanding that
governments close portsto ban pirates, deny them access to markets
and prosecute the companiessupporting them. In the Atlantic Ocean
alone, pirate vessels cash in onthe lucrative market for tuna,
taking thousands of tons of fish, incomplete contravention of
international regulations. The fish are thentransferred to
refrigerated cargo ships, known as reefers, "laundered"through
legal ports and sold on into the market. And it's not just tuna-
the problem is in every ocean and with almost every type of
fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Behind the mask&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always spot the swashbuckling pirates of old movies
andchildren's books - they fly the black "skull and crossbones"
flag fromtheir mast. But these days, pirates might fly no flag at
all, and evenif they do, it is quite possibly bought over the
internet for as littleas US$500. These flags represent countries
which don't investigate themanner or scale of pirate fishing - or
the working conditions of thepeople on board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" id="slideshow01" align="" height="480" width="430"&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25585/slideshow01.swf"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A hidden crime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact on fish stocks is matched by the devastation of other
marinelife. Reeling out lines sometimes 100 km long with tens of
thousands ofbaited hooks, the pirates also snare thousands of
turtles, hundreds ofthousands of seabirds and even more sharks -
many of which arede-finned and thrown back into the sea to die a
cruel death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little less conversation, a little more action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago governments agreed an International Plan of
Action onpirate fishing - but it seems not much has changed.The
Esperanza sails to the Atlantic just days before
theheroically-named High Seas Task Force meets to announce how it
plans tofurther discuss the problem of pirate fishing. We plan to
show themjust how urgent the need for action is, and how much we
need a taskforce &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en"&gt;defending our
oceans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2006/3/ejf.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice Foundation are workingtogether to expose the pirate fishing fleets that operate withoutsanction across the globe. Together the international environment andhuman rights organisations are demanding that governments close portsto ban pirates, deny them access to markets and prosecute companiessupporting them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Become an Ocean Defender now and help end piracy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	You cross a neighbour's lawn to stop a mugging. The police arrest you for trespass. In your defence in court, wouldn't you say the fact that you were attempting to stop a crime would be a relevant fact?

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Is painting an anti-war message on the stern of a military supply vessel a crime?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's precisely the question before the UK Law Lords this week,
asthey consider the fate of 20 individuals charged with activities
indefiance of the invasion of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of them chose to undertake non-violent civil disobedience at
military sites, to try and stop the rush to war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The six Fairford protestors - three independent groups of people
- allentered an RAF base at Fairford and attempted to immobilise
B52bombers. The planes they hindered would later be part of
thecarpet-bombing of Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Marchwood 14 enteredSouthampton's Marchwood Military Port
and occupied tanks, lockingthemselves with chains and padlocks. The
occupation was part of a widerweek of actions at Marchwood,
involving many other volunteers, whichaimed to stop the build up to
war. Other actions included using ourflagship the Rainbow Warrior
to blockade Marchwood military port andstop military hardware
leaving for the Gulf and boarding and conductinga 'sit in' on a
military supply ship bound for the Gulf with a cargo ofmilitary
hardware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tanks would later roll across Iraqsecuring oil fields while
UN-sealed nuclear facilities were leftunguarded, and participate in
a futile search for weapons of massdestruction. It was an invasion
that broke every rule againstpre-emptive war and was based on
intelligence that even former USSecretary of State Colin Powell now
admits was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theinvasion set a precedent under which India should be allowed
to attackPakistan on suspicions of aggression, Israel should be
allowed to bombIranian nuclear facilities suspected of weapons
activities, andIsrael's own nuclear arsenal could be cited as a
justifiable cause forinvasion by any of its neighbours. If ever
there was a slippery slope,the invasion of Iraq was it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="inlinebox" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key legal points which will be considered by the Law Lords are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)Isthe crime of aggression, defined and last used by the InternationalMilitary War crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945-6, and enshrined inUN law by the 1946 UN General Assembly, still part of international law?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)Ifa crime of aggression is illegal under international law is it a crimein UK law? In his controversial legal advice the Attorney Generalcertainly believed so, he stated, "Aggression is a crime undercustomary international law which automatically forms part of domesticlaw".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)Should UK courts have the authority to consider whether a crime of aggression has been committed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4)Werethe Greenpeace defendants denied their right to a fair trial, contraryto article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because theywere not allowed to argue issues which related to the legality of thewar? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the courts last year, activists asked that thelegality of the
war be considered in their defence, and sought therelease of the UK
Attorney General's secret advice to Tony Blair aboutthe legal
underpinnings of the invasion. But a district judge ruledthat "the
lawfulness of the war and the Attorney General's legalopinion are
not relevant to issues in the case." The full advice wasonly
finally released to the public after being leaked to TV news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One law for the leaders, a different law for the people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace UK Executive Director Stephen Tindale stated "These
peopleacted because they believed that the Iraq war was both
illegal andmorally wrong. The majority of international lawyers
have since agreedthe war was illegal. Yet our volunteers were
prevented from arguingthis in court and were effectively denied a
fair trial."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'reappealing that double standard. We say the legality of the
war iscentral to the question of whether the activists themselves
committed acrime in stopping it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tindale concluded, "This case is crucialas it could help ensure
that the UK is never again dragged into anillegal pre-emptive war,
against UN wishes and based on dodgyintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a society where governments aswell as
individuals can be held accountable for their actions and
theinternational rules of law are upheld, then it's crucial that
the rightto this defence of preventing a crime of aggression is
upheld."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hearing ended on Thursday 23rd February. A conclusion is not
expected for another month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=UKwarcase"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and join the thousands of people who take action to protect our environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=UKwarcase"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations.

            Worm's eye view of a mahogany tree in the Amazon forest, Brazil
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decree by President Lula of Brazil to create the 6.4
millionhectare (around 16 million acres) conservation area is a
great victoryfor the people of the Amazon battling landgrabbers,
cattle ranchers andloggers. The decree calls for around 1.6 million
hectares to bepermanently protected and totally off limits to
logging anddeforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another2.8 million hectares will be used for sustainable logging
concessionsto prevent deforestation and ensure well-managed
forests. Developmentguidelines will be improved in an additional 2
million hectares offorest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the 6.4 million hectares is a victory for manycommunities
in the Amazon, it still represents less than two percent ofthe
total Brazilian Amazon. An area one-third the size of the
newconservation area is lost every year in the Amazon to logging,
soyplantations and cattle ranchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a great step towardsthe protection and sustainable use
of the world's last ancient forestsbut is only a fraction of what
is needed. The Amazon and the life itsupports is seriously
threatened by destructive logging and landclearance to grow crops
like soy. We need more initiatives like this tosave the world's
last ancient forests," said Paulo Adário, forestcampaign
co-ordinator for Greenpeace Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newconservation areas will be created in a crucial part of
the Amazonalongside the notorious highway called the BR163. The
road cuts throughthe heart of the Amazon and a promise by the
Brazilian Government topave the road has resulted in accelerated
rates of deforestation in thearea. Without the increased protection
this decree provides, this areawould have soon been destroyed for
soy plantations and cattle ranches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="182148" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inthe city of Curitiba in southern Brazil, the Convention on
BiologicalDiversity (CBD) will meet in March to work on plans to
protect theworld's biodiversity from being lost to the world
permanently. One ofthe main aims of the CBD is to create a global
network of protectedareas that would form the basis for the
protection of the world'splants and animals by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the goals of the CBD are to bereached, Brazil and many other
countries will have to greatly increasethe rate of forest
protection. The consequences of failing to do so aremore than just
a broken international treaty. With only 20 percent ofthe world's
original ancient forest still standing, the fate of theseforests,
the wildlife that lives in them and the millions of people
whodepend on them everyday for their livelihood is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada recently announced that over two million hectares of the
&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt;
Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;along the pacific west coast of the
country will be protected alongwith sustainable management for a
further four million plus hectares.With Brazil adding another 6.4
million hectares, the global network ofprotected areas are
beginning to fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,with around 10 million hectares of forest around the
world beingdestroyed each and every year, there is still much work
to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=Samba"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and join the thousands of people who take action to protect our environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Samba"&gt;With your support, we can continue to protect ancient forest from destruction. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenland's glaciers are melting even faster than previously thought and contributing more and more to sea level rise caused by global warming. If you live near the sea and think global warming isn't a problem for you, it's probably time to think again.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A huge lake of melt water on top of a Greenland Glacier. The melting glaciers are fuelling sea level rise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest reports on increased levels of glacial discharge, in
the journal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, reports the amount of ice being dumped into the ocean from the
GreenlandIce Sheet has doubled in the last 5 years. Scientists had
thought thatglobal warming did not yet significantly threaten the
ice sheet and itwould take over a thousand years to break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full breakdown wouldresult in a catastrophic global sea level
rise of 7 meters. That's bye-byemost of Bangladesh, Netherlands,
Florida and would make London the newAtlantis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new evidence indicates the sheet is disintegrating quicker
thanexpected, and backs up &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/going-going-gone/"&gt;
our discovery of a disturbingly fast retreat of the Kangerdlugssuaq
glacier&lt;/a&gt; from our expedition there in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea level rise, caused by melting ice from Greenland and other
glaciersacross the world, is already threatening some of the most
vulnerablecommunities in the world - small island states in the
Pacific andIndian Oceans, in Bangladesh as well as the hundreds of
millions livingin low-lying coastal areas around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, the first global warming refugees are preparing to
leave theirhomes. In November of last year the Papua New Guinea
government decidedto start moving ten families at a time from the
horseshoe-shapedCarteret atolls in the Pacific to Bougainville, a
larger island some 60miles away. The Carterets are only 1.5 metres
high and areprojected to be completely uninhabitable by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are concerned -- but politicians are not taking
action.How much more evidence do we need before we begin taking
steps to avoidcatastrophe? The USAdministration and Australian
Government continue to block effectiveinternational action, other
world leaders talk a lot about globalwarming but avoid action
because it might cost too much. But is thecost of NewOrleans and
half of Florida being under water an acceptable price forAmerica's
oil addiction, President Bush?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25588/red-fjord-in-east-greenland.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our leaders won't jump, it's up to every one of us totake
positive action to avoid the worst consequences of global
warming.We can all take some, or, even better, all, of our
suggested &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;
12 steps&lt;/a&gt; to help the climate. Ifpossible, buy your energy from
a renewable energy supplier. If yourpolitician doesn't act on
global warming - vote for someone else whowill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when politicians feel the heat from voters will governments
shifttheir investments from dirty fossil fuel technologies to
clean,renewable energy sources that do not cause glaciers to melt,
seas torise and more people to die from increased extreme weather
events. We cannotwait for an illusory 'silver bullet' of future
technology to 'solve'the problem. We have the tools to start; what
we are missing is thepolitical will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the US, inactionon global warming at the top is being
met by change from below: cities, churches,businesses, trade
unions, students and the general public are notwaiting for the
White House to wake up - theUS renewable energy industry is
booming, almost half of US states and200 cities have either adopted
renewable energy targets or have pledged to meettheir own 'Kyoto'
commitments through action taken locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's needed is an energy revolution -- one which overturns
theancient fossil fuel regime and brings forth a new vision.
Revolutions don'tcome from the top. They come from the people. The

<item><language>en</language><title>Sister Dorothy: unfinished business</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/unfinished-business-321654/</url><text>
	One year since the violent death of Sister Dorothy at the hands of hired gunmen in the Amazon, little has changed for the rural workers and activists trying to protect the rainforest from ranchers, landgrabbers and loggers. 
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/boy-amongst-crosses.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A young boy stands amongst the 772 white crosses, each representing murdered rural workers and activists at a ceremony to mark the murder of Sister Dorothy one year ago.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a memorial in the remote rural area in the Amazon where
SisterDorothy lived and worked, Greenpeace activists, community
people, andother environmental and human rights advocates planted
white crossesfor each rural worker who has been assassinated in
land conflicts overthe last 33 years in the Amazon state of Pará
alone.  Theyerected  red crosses for every community leader
currently under adeath threat in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of their labours, there were 772 white and 48 red
crosses at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parástate in the Amazon is one of the most violent areas in the
world wheredisputes are routinely settled with weapons. At 72 years
old and aveteran of more than 30 years of activism, Sister Dorothy
Stang was nostranger to the dangers of her work, and she had been
threatened manytimes. On the morning of February 12th last year,
she was shot sixtimes by Rayfran das Neves with his accomplice,
Clodoaldo Batista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thetwo gunmen have since received sentences of 27 and 17 years
of prison,respectively, for her murder. The two landowners accused
of orderingthe murder have managed to postpone their trials through
judicialappeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the timeof her death, Sister Dorothy was working to create
sustainabledevelopment projects, which encourage Amazon communities
to use theland in an environmentally friendly way by combining food
productionand sustainable exploitation of forest resources, without
destroyingthe forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The creation and implementation of protected areasare important
to stop land grabbing, deforestation and the violencerelated to
illegal land occupation and environmental destruction in
theAmazon", said André Muggiati, Greenpeace Amazon Campaigner, in
Anapu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheBrazilian Government made many promises about the
implementation of thetwo Social Development Projects that Sister
Dorothy was working tocreate at the time of her murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her work remains unfinished. The violence continues. In the year
sinceher death at least another 18 rural workers have been murdered
in thestate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region marred by land grabbing, human rights
abuses,environmental degradation and land conflicts, Sister Dorothy
alwaysfought for the protection of the Amazon. It is now time for
theBrazilian Government to make good on their promises and help
SisterDorothy finish her work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Light a 'virtual candle'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/sisterdorothy/"&gt;You can light a 'virtual candle' to show your support for the creation and implementation of protected areas and effective presence of the rule of law in the State of Pará. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Somewhere out there, the only winners in the current conflict over Iran's nuclear programme are rubbing their hands with glee. They love hearing about the "inalienable right" to build nuclear power plants.  They love watching nuclear superpowers try to bully non-nuclear states into agreeing not to develop nukes, yet fail to explain why they themselves haven't gotten rid of theirs.  They love seeing nuclear weapons being presented as the measure of a country's greatness.  That's because the only winners in this conflict sell the stuff that makes all this war drumming possible.  They sell nuclear power plants. They build nuclear weapons.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For the same investment, wind generates 5 times the jobs and 2.3 times the power as a nuclear reactor.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TheInternational Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Board of
Governers voted onSaturday, 27 to 3, with 5 abstentions,  to report
Iran to the UNSecurityCouncil over allegations that it is pursuing
a programme to acquirenuclear weapons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision is a grave mistake which threatens to further
escalate tensions in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to any nation acquiring nuclear technology
andnuclear weapons, including Iran. But we believe the best way to
ensurethat doesn't happen is for the IAEA to have continued access
to Iranian facilities.  Iran hasalready made clear that if the
matter goes to the Security Council itwill restrict inspections and
no longer comply with requests to revealinformation above and
beyond what is legally required under existingtreaty
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As past situations have shown, in particular in Iraq, any action
thatrestricts inspections and that closes opportunities to
rebuildconfidence can only lead to a confidence vacuum.  And where
hardevidence is not available, warmongers on all sides exploit the
currencyof fear and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN Security Council is simply not the right body to resolve
aconflict over whether a country has a right to a nuclear programme
ornot. The Security Council has failed to live up to itsCharter
obligations to minimize human and economic resources spent
onarmaments, or to advance the goal of a Middle East nuclear
freezone.  Instead the permanent members (who are permanent
membersprecisely because they have nuclear weapons) have
participated in armsraces and weapons profiteering, stubbornly
refusing to comply withtreaty commitments to eliminate their
nuclear arsenals. Given thisrecord, how can the Security Council
resolve the Iran crisis?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the failure to treat the nuclear weapons programmes of
othercountries with the same vigilance as Iran's, how can the
accusation ofhypocrisy not have a ring of truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only solution to this crisis is a Nuclear Free Zone in the
MiddleEast.  It's a vital first step towards removing all
nuclearproliferation risks in the region, as well as providing the
essentialsecurity guarantees from nuclear weapons states outside
the region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means an end not only to existing and nascent nuclear
weapons programmes, but an end to nuclear power as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran insists that it is simply exercising its rights under the
terms ofthe Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  to develop "peaceful
nucleartechnology."  There is no such thing as peaceful
nucleartechnology.  Once a country has a nuclear power programme it
ispossible for it to develop a weapons programme. That's as true
forGermany, Japan and Brazil as it is for Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our position on Iran is the same as that for all countries with
nuclearpower or nuclear weapons - the ONLY basis for peace,
security andsustainable development is to abandon nuclear
programmes; and to phaseout nuclear power in favour of sustainable
renewable technologies - inother words, a nuclear-free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has an opportunity to stop this slide toward war by calling
for aregional nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The
international community hasan opportunity to stop this slide toward
war by pursuing exactly thesame thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current path is lose-lose for everyone except the makers of
nuclear weapons and the peddlers of nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=iran"&gt;Support Greenpeace, support a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	ExxonMobil announces record company profits of US$32 billion in 2005. Meanwhile, NASA notes that 2005 was the hottest year on record for our warming planet. Coincidence? We don't think so.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/exxon-profits-and-climate-chan.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/exxon-profits-and-climate-chan.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Exxon profits while the world warms.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Exxon sees the billions rolling in faster and faster,
evidencethat global warming is gathering pace is rapidly piling up.
While mostoil companies are making huge profits, what Exxon does --
and doesn'tdo -- with those profits is what marks them out as the
world's numberone climate criminal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to see why Exxon isrich. Higher oil and gas
prices, a friendly US administration whichsubsidises big oil and
goes &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/23/politics/23leases.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;
easy on taxes and fees&lt;/a&gt;, and the kind of fiscal conservatism
that &lt;a target="_blank" href="/international/en/news/features/pay-up-exxon/"&gt;holds
back compensation&lt;/a&gt;for environmental disasters like the Exxon
Valdez.  That $US 32billion is the largest profit ever recorded by
an American corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butdespite the worldwide consensus to the contrary, Exxon
continues tofund the view that we just can't figure out what oil
has to do withglobal warming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, an industry lobby group called the Scientific
Alliance was &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1399585,00.html"&gt;
working the halls of government in Britain&lt;/a&gt; to soften Tony
Blair's position of global warming.  They publisheda joint report
with the George C Marshall Institute in Washington thatthey claimed
"undermined" studies that attribute global warming tohuman
activity, and in particular the burning of fossil fuels like
coaland oil. The Marshall institute has received more than a half a
milliondollars from ExxonMobil since 1998 including US$95,000 for
its "globalclimate change programme."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in September 2003 &lt;a target="_blank" href="/international/en/news/features/investigation-of-exxon-front-g/"&gt;
we uncovered a smoking-gun memo&lt;/a&gt;that revealed an Exxon-funded
lobby group had been asked byconservative elements in the Bush
Administration to sue their owncolleagues at the Environmental
Protection Agency.  An EPA studyhad dared to suggest there might be
a link between oil and climatechange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;object id="ExposeExxon" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" align="middle" height="325" width="425"&gt;&lt;param value="sameDomain" name="allowScriptAccess"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies
has openly said the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article341945.ece"&gt;Bush
administration is trying to censor the science&lt;/a&gt; of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Hansen, who broke the news that &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/2005_warmest.html" target="_blank"&gt;2005 was the hottest year on record&lt;/a&gt;,is facing
an official review of all his written publications and
beingrequired to vet requests for interviews from reporters. His
crime wastelling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41126000/gif/_41126372_temp_anom_gra416.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereis broad and overwhelming scientific consensus that climate
change isoccurring, is caused in large part by human activities
(such as burningfossil fuels), and if left unchecked will likely
have disastrousconsequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight of the 10 warmest years since 1860 have occurred within
the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Inaction could cost the Earth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereis solid scientific evidence that we should act now on
climate change.So says the scientific community that is not paid by
Exxon.  Thatincludes declarations such as the Joint Statement last
year by thenational science academies of the US, UK, France,
Russia, Germany,Japan, Italy, Canada, Brazil, China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;"[Climate change is]the only thing that I
believe has the power to fundamentally end themarch of civilization
as we know it, and make a lot of the otherefforts that we're making
irrelevant and impossible." --Former USPresident Bill Clinton,
Davos, January 2006&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Exxonmobil isstreets ahead as the world's number one climate
criminal. It has donemore than any other company to stop the world
from tackling climatechange. Exxonmobil admits that it has a
'vested interest' in stoppinggovernments from taking action on
climate change. For over a decade, ithas attempted to sabotage
international negotiations on the issue andblock agreements that
would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'stime the company took some of that massive profit and
invested it inclean, safe, renewable energy. Write the new CEO of
ExxonMobil anddemand that the world's richest oil company stop
funding inaction, andstart working on solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Have a word with the new Exxon boss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ga3.org/campaign/ExxonMobil"&gt;There's a brand new CEO over at ExxonMobil -- Rex Tillerson.   Let him know your views on energy and the environment as a consumer and a global citizen now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=ExxonProfits"&gt;Exxon won't fund our work -- how about you? Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations.  This allows us to name and shame without fear or favour -- an increasingly rare ability in today's corporate-dominated world.  We need people like you to keep us going.  Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Long wait for "immediate" action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/fleg-111/</url><text>
	More than four years ago, East Asian governments promised to take “immediate” steps to stop illegal logging. Yet the Paradise Forests are no better off than they were on September 13, 2001 when delegates to the East Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) ministerial meeting promised to take action.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/islands.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/islands.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Paradise Forests stretch from South East Asia, across the islands of Indonesia and on towards Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has called on participating FLEG countries to put
words intoaction and address the problem of illegal logging in the
region -before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the FLEG declaration promised to address forest crime
atall levels, logs that have been illegally harvested still find
theirway to countries like Japan and China. Some logs are used
domestically,others are processed and sold on to markets in Europe
and the USA,where demand for cheap timber and wood products is
high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLEG must target both the producer countries (like PNG
andIndonesia) and consumer countries (like China, Japan and the
EU),ensuring governments prosecute individuals and companies
involved inthe illegal timber trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paradise Forests are among some of the most heavily
loggedareas on earth. Much of the intact areas of these forests
have alreadybeen logged. In Indonesia the figure is as high as 72
percent, in Papua NewGuinea (PNG) it is 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this rate, the Paradise Forests and the unique plants and
animals that live there could be gone in ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, is on 'Forests Crime
Patrol' fromPNG, through Indonesia and on to Japan to show that,
despitecommitments from governments, illegal logging continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, our volunteers are living and working
alongside locallandowners to showcase community forest solutions at
the Global ForestRescue Station (GFRS) at Lake Murray in Western
Province, PNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=fleg"&gt;Help us save the Paradise Forests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Editor's note: In preparing this article about the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, we read the news stories from all of the most reputable sources, we read the reports from all of the best institutions, we read the statements from all of the governments and agencies, but nowhere could we find a reasonable, rational, or plausible explanation of what was happening. We decided the only answer was the absurd.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            More nuclear power = less nuclear weapons? Only if you're as mad as a hatter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Alice had slipped down the Rabbit Hole, the news had
beengetting curiouser and curiouser. She found herself at avery
large table where the March Hare, a dormouse, a hippopotamus,
andthe Mad Hatter were having tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hatter was telling a story about how George W. TweedleDum
had justgot back from a trip to India, where he was promising to
give awayshiny new nuclear technology. At the same time, TweedleDee
hadbeen getting very red-faced at the United Nations about
someshiny new nuclear technology in Iran that he wanted taken away.
He broke off his story to wave an empty teapot at Alice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Would you like less tea, my dear?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Don't you mean &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tea?" asked Alice politely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No no no no. We don't have any "more tea" we only have
"lesstea." And it's very rude to ask for what we don't have. Now,
would youlike some more Peaceful Nuclear Technology and Less
Nuclear Weapons togo with that?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Umm, yes please" said Alice, thinking this must be the correct
answer and not wanting to upset the Hatter again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There you go again, asking for what we can't possibly give
you!" cried the Hatter, springing to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How about some safe, clean nuclear power instead?" offered the
dormouse helpfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That sounds quite nice, I suppose," said Alice with some
hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wrong answer! No such thing!" the Hatter shouted with glee,
politely adding "One lump or two?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice was quite put out. "Isn't it rude to offer something you
don'thave?" asked Alice. "And even ruder to offer something that
doesn'texist? What kind of a tea party is this?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why this is an IAEA Board of Governors meeting, my dear, and
we'rehaving an NP Tea Party!" said the March Hare, glancing
nervously at avery large watch which was chiming the hour by
barking loudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"An NP Tea Party? What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's all very simple," said the Hatter as he handed out slices
of cakeand then went around smacking everyone's hand when they
started eatingit, "the NPT is a treaty in which the parties that
have nuclear weaponsagree to get rid of their nuclear weapons in
exchange for the partiesthat don't have nuclear weapons promising
not to get nuclear weapons.As part of the incentive for not getting
nuclear weapons they'rerewarded with the means to make nuclear
weapons.  Slice of Cake?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice eyed the yellow cake suspiciously. She heard a distant
voice shouting "Off with their heads!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Now, at the moment we're discussing the case of Iran, which has
signedthe treaty and promised not to build nuclear weapons and so
has beenrewarded with the means to make nuclear weapons. But there
are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;some people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at this party who think that they're actually using thosemeans
to make nuclear weapons as a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;means to make nuclear weapons&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Which they've said they don't want..." said Alice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oh yes, but as you of all people should know, my dear, saying
what wemean isn't always the same as meaning what we say. Saying
thatthey aren't making nuclear weapons is just what you'd expect
them to doif they were making nuclear weapons. Proof enough."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hatter took a slice of cake and pushed it into the face of
the Hippo, whoalready had his mouth full. "You shouldn't eat so
much cake," he sputtered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George W. TweedleDum suddenly appeared. "Personically, I'd like
to see lessnuclear weapons in the world. Which is why I'm building
more."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"THAT's the spirit!" cried the Hatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But I don't understand!" cried Alice. "If you can use
nuclearpower technology to make nuclear weapons, and you want to
get rid ofthe nuclear weapons, shouldn't you stop handing out the
nuclear powertechnology?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George W. TweedleDum patted Alice on the head. "You are anabsurd
little creature, aren't you? Hatter, why don't you explanify
theTreaty thing?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The TREATY thing, yes yes, mustn't forget that!" cried the
Hatter ashe absent-mindedly dipped the dormouse in his tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Now yousee on the one hand, Iran has signed the Non-treaty on
WeaponsProliferation, and the Treaty on the Proliferation of
Non-weaponsNuclear, and the Proliferation of Treaties on the
Proliferation ofWeapons, Non..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Which are all the same thing," said the dormouse, yawning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"So if THEY try to get nuclear weapons, that's quite illegal and
wemust send them to the Queen of Hearts' Security Council for
punishment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"India, on the other hand," said the Hatter holding up a second
handand dropping the teapot on the dormouse's head, "has never
signed thetreaty, so their nuclear weapons are perfectly OK and
they should berewarded with more nuclear technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pakistan, on the third hand," and oddly the Hatter actually
produce athird hand at this point, " has never signed the treaty,
but we're notso sure about them, so we're NOT going to reward them
with more nucleartechnology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George W. TweedleDum smiled broadly. "The lessonification here
isnever, never sign a treaty. That's my motto. Lot of bother. I
promiseto keep my nuclear weapons and everybody else has to get rid
of theirsunless I say they can keep them. That's my kind of Treaty.
I believe inmaintaining high standards. I believe in maintaining
high standards."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You said that twice." said the Hatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He has to say it twice," said the dormouse. "It's a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;standard."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hatter now declared it was time for a vote. "Now, who
thinkswe should send Iran to the Queen of Hearts? ("Off with their
heads!came the cry from the garden next door again...) Everyone
looked at theHippo. The hippo started to raise his foot, and
everyone in theparty started to raise their hands. Or paws.  Then
the hippo puthis foot down, and everyone in the party did the same.
Then George W.TweedleDum took a large hatpin and quietly stuck it
into the ratherlarge backside of the Hippo, who jumped into the air
with his footraised, and everyone in the party followed suit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There then, it's settled, off to the Queen of Hearts with
them!" sang the Hatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Is that what you call democracy?" asked Alice curiously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Well it looks like democracy, but in reality the Hippo decides,
andthe Hippo just does what TweedleDum tells him to do" said the
Hatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oh. I see," said Alice. "I suppose then it's not really a
democracy at all, is it?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Well it's just a very different kind of democracy, my dear.
Some people call it a Hippocracy. Cake?"&lt;/p&gt;

	Electronics giant Hewlett Packard has risen to the challenge we set them and committed to a phase out plan for a range of hazardous chemicals in its products. Now we are at the consumer electronics industry's biggest annual event to ask "who's next?" 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One of series of actions that lead to HP's change of heart on phasing out the worst toxic chemicals from its products.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update September 18, 2006: &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hp-apple-toxic-laptops180906/"&gt;New test results&lt;/a&gt; reveal high levels of contamination in HP laptop.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which company will be following HP's lead and taking the first
step intackling the growing problem of toxic electronic waste by
committing toremove hazardous chemicals from its products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP joins big industry names like Sony, Nokia, Samsung, LG and
SonyEricsson who are leading the industry by &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
positive example on toxicchemicals&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Acer, Apple,
Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, IBM,Lenovo, Panasonic, Siemens and Toshiba
have so far failed to follow theindustry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP's change of policy didn't happen overnight. Back in 2003 we
foundthat one of their computers contained particularly high
amounts of atoxic chemical. Subsequently we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pulling-the-plug-on-dirty-elec/"&gt;
confronted HP&lt;/a&gt; with the reality of theirlack of action at their
European headquarters, asked awkward questionswhen the HP boss
visited China and finally &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hewlett-packard-toxic-trouble-111/"&gt;
turned up at their worldheadquarters&lt;/a&gt; in California with a
special message for their staff.Thousands of concerned people wrote
to HP about its chemicals policyand technology media covered the &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/Greenpeace+HP+stands+for+harmful+products/2100-1047_3-5984683.html"&gt;
"Greenpeace versus HP"&lt;/a&gt; showdown infull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which company, currently ignoring the issue of toxic electronic
waste, wants tobe the next focus of our campaign? We'll be laying
down that gauntletto the remaining companies while they are busy
showing off their latestofferings at the world's largest
electronics fair, CeBIT, in Hanover,Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electronics industry will be hard at work promoting its
everfaster, smaller and smarter gadgets but it cannot continue to
ignorethe &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/"&gt;
dangerous explosion in electronic scrap (e-waste)&lt;/a&gt; containing
toxicchemicals and heavy metals that cannot be disposed of or
recycledsafely. These high-tech gadgets &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/"&gt;
often end up dumped in Asia&lt;/a&gt; and takenapart by hand in
primitive, highly polluting and very definitelylow-tech manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Clean it up and take it back!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By removing the toxic chemicals, companies make it cleanerand
easier to recycle their products. Companies that takeresponsibility
for the whole lifecycle of their products from cradle tograve
ensure that their products last longer and cause less pollution.&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/solutions/"&gt;
Our vision for the industry&lt;/a&gt; is one that produces cleaner,
longerlasting, more sustainable products that don't contribute to
the growingtide of toxic, short lived products currently being
dumped in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toxics campaigner, Martin Hojsík will be asking the
electronicscompanies where they stand on these issues at CeBit and
he has asuggestion for next years event; &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The motto for this years CeBit is'digital solutions for work and life', we want next years motto to be'digital solutions without pollution'!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Without the help of concerned citizens we wouldn't have victories like this. Become a Greenpeace cyberactivist and join a winning team.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=HP-win"&gt;Help keep us in action. In order to ensure our independence, we don't accept donations from corporations or governments; we rely entirely on people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Saving Paradise</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/saving-paradise100200/</url><text>
	In the remote Paradise Forests of Papua New Guinea, illegal and destructive logging continues to threaten both the local communities and the fragile ecosystem. So we have launched a major initiative to help indigenous communities establish their rights to the land they have called home for generations.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            'Mud men' perform traditional dances to welcome the arrival of the Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow Warrior in Port Moresby's harbour. Greenpeace launches a major initiative to help protect Asia Pacific's last remaining ancient rainforests - the 'Paradise Forests - by unveiling its Global Forest Rescue Station in a remote part of Papua New Guinea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the invitation of the local communities, we have established
the&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/gfrs/"&gt;
Global Forest Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; (GFRS) on the western edge of Lake
Murray,deep in the Paradise Forests. From the GFRS, our activists
from aroundthe world will help members of the Kuni, Begwa and Pari
tribes mark outthe boundaries of their lands to protect it from
loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Locate the &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/gfrsblog.kmz"&gt;Global
Forest Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; (GFRS) using Google Earth - click &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to download Google
Earth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Althoughin Papua New Guinean law, 97 percent of the land is
recognised as beingowned by the customary landowners who live
there, many tribalboundaries have never been officially recorded.
Until this is done theland is effectively up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With large-scale industriallogging, the local communities see
very little of the huge profitsgenerated by the logging and the
forest cannot sustain the level ofdestruction. For each tree felled
for timber at least seventeen othersare destroyed, not to mention
the impact on the diverse wildlife thatthe forest support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Ourforest is like
a supermarket and our survival depends on the forest.The forest
gives us our homes, our food and our medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Sep Galeva, Kuni clan leader&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butthere is a solution. Boundary marking, also known as
demarcation, isthe first step in allowing the local communities to
use the forest inecologically sustainable ways that doesn't destroy
the forest. The GFRSwill be used as a base camp to help the local
communities mark outaround 300,000 hectares of their lands in the
Lake Murray region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheStation isn't just about mapping out land boundaries. Part of
the workdone there will be to promote small-scale community
enterprises thathelp maintain the forest and bring greater benefits
to the communitiesthat live there such as eco-forestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of wholesaledestruction of the forest with large
machines to extract the timber,portable equipment is used to
minimise the impact. Trees are milledwhere they fall and are
carried along bush trails and floated out alongrivers, and then
strict guidelines and monitoring allow the forest toregenerate
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profits from this method of forestry forlocal communities
are also much more than those that trickle down fromthe logging
companies, between four to 10 times greater, all of whichis shared
among the local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with community-basedsolutions the Global Rescue Forest
Station will help protect the uniquebiodiversity of Papua New
Guinea. With only one percent of the forestsunder any kind of
protection, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

	Armed and masked, scouring the oceans, stealing food from hungry families – modern day pirates are a far cry from the glamour of Hollywood movies. But they are a multi billion-dollar reality for many communities that can least afford to be robbed. The Esperanza sets out to foil the pirates.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/2/illegal-longliner-salvora-with.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Illegal longliner with it's crew standing on deck wearing balaclavas to cover their identity, the crew are attempting to fish illegally in Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending 70 days at sea confronting the whaling fleets in
theSouthern Ocean, the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/"&gt;Esperanza is setting sail
for the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; - thistime to expose the modern day pirates
who steal fish from the poorestnations and leave a trail of
environmental destruction in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stolen fish, stolen futures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could that fish on your dinner plate be stolen? On this next leg
of ouryear-long expedition, we are working with the &lt;a href="http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html"&gt;Environmental
JusticeFoundation&lt;/a&gt;. Together we are are demanding that
governments close portsto ban pirates, deny them access to markets
and prosecute the companiessupporting them. In the Atlantic Ocean
alone, pirate vessels cash in onthe lucrative market for tuna,
taking thousands of tons of fish, incomplete contravention of
international regulations. The fish are thentransferred to
refrigerated cargo ships, known as reefers, "laundered"through
legal ports and sold on into the market. And it's not just tuna-
the problem is in every ocean and with almost every type of
fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Behind the mask&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always spot the swashbuckling pirates of old movies
andchildren's books - they fly the black "skull and crossbones"
flag fromtheir mast. But these days, pirates might fly no flag at
all, and evenif they do, it is quite possibly bought over the
internet for as littleas US$500. These flags represent countries
which don't investigate themanner or scale of pirate fishing - or
the working conditions of thepeople on board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" id="slideshow01" align="" height="480" width="430"&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25585/slideshow01.swf"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A hidden crime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact on fish stocks is matched by the devastation of other
marinelife. Reeling out lines sometimes 100 km long with tens of
thousands ofbaited hooks, the pirates also snare thousands of
turtles, hundreds ofthousands of seabirds and even more sharks -
many of which arede-finned and thrown back into the sea to die a
cruel death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little less conversation, a little more action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago governments agreed an International Plan of
Action onpirate fishing - but it seems not much has changed.The
Esperanza sails to the Atlantic just days before
theheroically-named High Seas Task Force meets to announce how it
plans tofurther discuss the problem of pirate fishing. We plan to
show themjust how urgent the need for action is, and how much we
need a taskforce &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en"&gt;defending our
oceans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2006/3/ejf.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenland's glaciers are melting even faster than previously thought and contributing more and more to sea level rise caused by global warming. If you live near the sea and think global warming isn't a problem for you, it's probably time to think again.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A huge lake of melt water on top of a Greenland Glacier. The melting glaciers are fuelling sea level rise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest reports on increased levels of glacial discharge, in
the journal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, reports the amount of ice being dumped into the ocean from the
GreenlandIce Sheet has doubled in the last 5 years. Scientists had
thought thatglobal warming did not yet significantly threaten the
ice sheet and itwould take over a thousand years to break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full breakdown wouldresult in a catastrophic global sea level
rise of 7 meters. That's bye-byemost of Bangladesh, Netherlands,
Florida and would make London the newAtlantis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new evidence indicates the sheet is disintegrating quicker
thanexpected, and backs up &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/going-going-gone/"&gt;
our discovery of a disturbingly fast retreat of the Kangerdlugssuaq
glacier&lt;/a&gt; from our expedition there in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea level rise, caused by melting ice from Greenland and other
glaciersacross the world, is already threatening some of the most
vulnerablecommunities in the world - small island states in the
Pacific andIndian Oceans, in Bangladesh as well as the hundreds of
millions livingin low-lying coastal areas around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, the first global warming refugees are preparing to
leave theirhomes. In November of last year the Papua New Guinea
government decidedto start moving ten families at a time from the
horseshoe-shapedCarteret atolls in the Pacific to Bougainville, a
larger island some 60miles away. The Carterets are only 1.5 metres
high and areprojected to be completely uninhabitable by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are concerned -- but politicians are not taking
action.How much more evidence do we need before we begin taking
steps to avoidcatastrophe? The USAdministration and Australian
Government continue to block effectiveinternational action, other
world leaders talk a lot about globalwarming but avoid action
because it might cost too much. But is thecost of NewOrleans and
half of Florida being under water an acceptable price forAmerica's
oil addiction, President Bush?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25588/red-fjord-in-east-greenland.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our leaders won't jump, it's up to every one of us totake
positive action to avoid the worst consequences of global
warming.We can all take some, or, even better, all, of our
suggested &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;
12 steps&lt;/a&gt; to help the climate. Ifpossible, buy your energy from
a renewable energy supplier. If yourpolitician doesn't act on
global warming - vote for someone else whowill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when politicians feel the heat from voters will governments
shifttheir investments from dirty fossil fuel technologies to
clean,renewable energy sources that do not cause glaciers to melt,
seas torise and more people to die from increased extreme weather
events. We cannotwait for an illusory 'silver bullet' of future
technology to 'solve'the problem. We have the tools to start; what
we are missing is thepolitical will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the US, inactionon global warming at the top is being
met by change from below: cities, churches,businesses, trade
unions, students and the general public are notwaiting for the
White House to wake up - theUS renewable energy industry is
booming, almost half of US states and200 cities have either adopted
renewable energy targets or have pledged to meettheir own 'Kyoto'
commitments through action taken locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's needed is an energy revolution -- one which overturns
theancient fossil fuel regime and brings forth a new vision.
Revolutions don'tcome from the top. They come from the people. The
cost ofinaction is, quite literally, the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/energyrevolsignup?MM_URL=EnergyRevSignupFromGreenlandMeltStory"&gt;Become an Energy Revolutionary.

	It’s a lot smaller than the Esperanza.  In fact, a few months ago the Sugayatri was just another dilapidated fishing boat.  But with a coat of rainbow-coloured paint and a giant wooden turtle mounted like a figurehead, it’s now the latest addition to the fleet defending our oceans. The Sugayatri has just embarked on a mission to save the Olive Ridley turtle in India.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Sugayatri, Greenpeace India's boat, defending Olive Ridley turtles.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boat has been completely refitted to handle its new and
verydemanding job: to patrol the waters around Orissa's Gahirmatha
MarineSanctuary, documenting and observing the mass nesting of the
OliveRidley Turtle, and trying to make this nesting season a little
saferfor the Olive Ridley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beaches of Orissa, India, provide one of the last nesting
groundsof the endangered Olive Ridley turtles in the world. Every
year,between December and April, thousands of these beautiful
creatures comeashore on the beaches of Orissa to lay their
eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25589/thousands-of-olive-ridley-turt.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, now Orissa resembles a turtle graveyard more than
abreeding ground.  The populations of the Olive Ridley
arethreatened by various factors like trawling, offshore drilling
for oiland gas, and the proposed construction of an industrial port
near thenesting sites. Over 100,000 dead Olive Ridleys have been
washed ashoreon the beaches of Orissa in the last decade alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew of the Sugayatri have deployed six buoys to demarcate
theboundaries of the marine sanctuary. They have already seen first
handthe agony of an Olive Ridley caught in a gillnet. And they have
beeninstrumental in saving the lives of several trapped turtles.
Nearby,activists have established the "Turtle Witness Camp". The
camp wasinaugurated with a traditional Indian ceremony, which was
attended byhundreds of fisher families from neighbouring
villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item url="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/dead-turtles-caught-in-the-ne" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first week alone, our activists and volunteers at the
campwitnessed the circle of life in all its gore and glory.
They'vewatched, awe-struck, as scores of mating Olive Ridley
turtles surfacearound Sugayatri. They've walked the beaches of
Orissa, deeply moved bythe many dead turtles literally dotting the
sand, and then found hopeagain after discovering flipper tracks.
These Ocean Defenders will stayin the area for five months to
monitor and document congregationalpatterns and mating of the Olive
Ridley at sea. Six weeks into itsinception, life at the Turtle
Witness Camp is already a kaleidoscope ofemotions, from awe at the
exquisite beauty of the region and the OliveRidley turtles, but
also the needless and senseless deaths of hundredsof the same
turtles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the Esperanza will embark on the next leg of our
year-longjourney, confronting pirate fishing fleets and their
devastatingimpacts on tuna in the Atlantic. In the meantime, the
plight of theOlive Ridley is yet another example of a species, like
whales,suffering because of human greed.  Follow this emerging
story at&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/turtlecamp/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace India's blog&lt;/a&gt;, where volunteers,
activists and visiting crewfrom the Arctic Sunrise  will describe

	An area twice the size of Belgium has been given greater protection in the Amazon after a Presidential decree. This is around the same area of the Amazon that was lost to deforestation over the past three years.

            Worm's eye view of a mahogany tree in the Amazon forest, Brazil
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decree by President Lula of Brazil to create the 6.4
millionhectare (around 16 million acres) conservation area is a
great victoryfor the people of the Amazon battling landgrabbers,
cattle ranchers andloggers. The decree calls for around 1.6 million
hectares to bepermanently protected and totally off limits to
logging anddeforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another2.8 million hectares will be used for sustainable logging
concessionsto prevent deforestation and ensure well-managed
forests. Developmentguidelines will be improved in an additional 2
million hectares offorest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the 6.4 million hectares is a victory for manycommunities
in the Amazon, it still represents less than two percent ofthe
total Brazilian Amazon. An area one-third the size of the
newconservation area is lost every year in the Amazon to logging,
soyplantations and cattle ranchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a great step towardsthe protection and sustainable use
of the world's last ancient forestsbut is only a fraction of what
is needed. The Amazon and the life itsupports is seriously
threatened by destructive logging and landclearance to grow crops
like soy. We need more initiatives like this tosave the world's
last ancient forests," said Paulo Adário, forestcampaign
co-ordinator for Greenpeace Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newconservation areas will be created in a crucial part of
the Amazonalongside the notorious highway called the BR163. The
road cuts throughthe heart of the Amazon and a promise by the
Brazilian Government topave the road has resulted in accelerated
rates of deforestation in thearea. Without the increased protection
this decree provides, this areawould have soon been destroyed for
soy plantations and cattle ranches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="182148" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inthe city of Curitiba in southern Brazil, the Convention on
BiologicalDiversity (CBD) will meet in March to work on plans to
protect theworld's biodiversity from being lost to the world
permanently. One ofthe main aims of the CBD is to create a global
network of protectedareas that would form the basis for the
protection of the world'splants and animals by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the goals of the CBD are to bereached, Brazil and many other
countries will have to greatly increasethe rate of forest
protection. The consequences of failing to do so aremore than just
a broken international treaty. With only 20 percent ofthe world's
original ancient forest still standing, the fate of theseforests,
the wildlife that lives in them and the millions of people
whodepend on them everyday for their livelihood is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada recently announced that over two million hectares of the
&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt;
Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;along the pacific west coast of the
country will be protected alongwith sustainable management for a
further four million plus hectares.With Brazil adding another 6.4
million hectares, the global network ofprotected areas are
beginning to fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,with around 10 million hectares of forest around the
world beingdestroyed each and every year, there is still much work
to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=Samba"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and join the thousands of people who take action to protect our environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Samba"&gt;With your support, we can continue to protect ancient forest from destruction. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	One year since the violent death of Sister Dorothy at the hands of hired gunmen in the Amazon, little has changed for the rural workers and activists trying to protect the rainforest from ranchers, landgrabbers and loggers. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/boy-amongst-crosses.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/boy-amongst-crosses.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A young boy stands amongst the 772 white crosses, each representing murdered rural workers and activists at a ceremony to mark the murder of Sister Dorothy one year ago.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a memorial in the remote rural area in the Amazon where
SisterDorothy lived and worked, Greenpeace activists, community
people, andother environmental and human rights advocates planted
white crossesfor each rural worker who has been assassinated in
land conflicts overthe last 33 years in the Amazon state of Pará
alone.  Theyerected  red crosses for every community leader
currently under adeath threat in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of their labours, there were 772 white and 48 red
crosses at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parástate in the Amazon is one of the most violent areas in the
world wheredisputes are routinely settled with weapons. At 72 years
old and aveteran of more than 30 years of activism, Sister Dorothy
Stang was nostranger to the dangers of her work, and she had been
threatened manytimes. On the morning of February 12th last year,
she was shot sixtimes by Rayfran das Neves with his accomplice,
Clodoaldo Batista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thetwo gunmen have since received sentences of 27 and 17 years
of prison,respectively, for her murder. The two landowners accused
of orderingthe murder have managed to postpone their trials through
judicialappeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the timeof her death, Sister Dorothy was working to create
sustainabledevelopment projects, which encourage Amazon communities
to use theland in an environmentally friendly way by combining food
productionand sustainable exploitation of forest resources, without
destroyingthe forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The creation and implementation of protected areasare important
to stop land grabbing, deforestation and the violencerelated to
illegal land occupation and environmental destruction in
theAmazon", said André Muggiati, Greenpeace Amazon Campaigner, in
Anapu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheBrazilian Government made many promises about the
implementation of thetwo Social Development Projects that Sister
Dorothy was working tocreate at the time of her murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her work remains unfinished. The violence continues. In the year
sinceher death at least another 18 rural workers have been murdered
in thestate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region marred by land grabbing, human rights
abuses,environmental degradation and land conflicts, Sister Dorothy
alwaysfought for the protection of the Amazon. It is now time for
theBrazilian Government to make good on their promises and help
SisterDorothy finish her work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Light a 'virtual candle'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/sisterdorothy/"&gt;You can light a 'virtual candle' to show your support for the creation and implementation of protected areas and effective presence of the rule of law in the State of Pará. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Take ten years of difficult, dangerous, and at times, heartbreaking work. Add thousands of activists from around the world -- some who sent emails, some who stood on the blockades, some who voted against destruction with their wallets. Some who were beaten, some who were sued, some who were arrested. Today it added up to victory. Common sense has prevailed and one of the world's treasures, the Great Bear Rainforest, is saved from destruction.

            Great Bear Rainforest, Canada. Moss cover the rocks and fallen trees. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewind ten years to a beautiful forested area on the west coast
ofCanada, in the province of British Columbia imaginatively called
the'mid-coast timber supply area.' The old name for this
magnificentforest highlighted its intended destiny, a destiny that
would radicallychange once a group of environmental activists,
along with FirstNations communities decided that sitting still and
watching millions ofhectares of ancient rainforest being felled was
not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theydecided that action was needed to protect the home of
grizzly, blackand rare white "Spirit" bears, wild salmon, eagles
and wolves as wellas one-thousand year old cedar trees and ancient
spruce. Little didthey know then that the journey from those early
days of what was called "the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.ca/e/campaign/forests/greatbear/background/history.php" target="_blank"&gt;War in the Woods&lt;/a&gt;"would lead them to one of the
greatest environmental victories inCanadian history.&lt;/p&gt;

which was being destroyed at an alarming rate tofeed a growing
international appetite for wood, paper and toilet roll,"said Gavin
Edwards, Global Forest Campaign Coordinator at
GreenpeaceInternational. "The world's last ancient forests need a
global networkof protected areas to survive - and the Great Bear
Rainforest is a goodstart."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="322450" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finalagreement, announced today by the British Columbian
Government has beennegotiated between environmental groups, First
Nations, loggingcompanies and the government. It allows for the
full protection of onethird of the Great Bear Rainforest from any
logging, an area of overtwo million hectares (over five million
acres). Significantly, it alsoensures that the logging industry
implements a strict ecosystem-basedmanagement system by 2009 in the
two thirds of the forest that isoutside strict protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Greenpeace will be watchingto see if the British Columbian
Government follows through on thesecommitments and takes this
opportunity to make the Great BearRainforest a global model of
forest sustainability," said Amanda Carr,forest campaigner for
Greenpeace Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This victory sets thescene for many more battles for forests
around the world. Activists andcommunities have shown that the
senseless destruction can be stoppedand that sustainably managed
forests are the way forward. This March,the governments of the
world will be meeting in Brazil at theConvention on Biological
Diversity (CBD) to work on plans to stop theslide towards
extinction of the world's plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilstthe Great Bear Rainforest has been protected, an area of
ancient forestaround one and a half times the total size of the
Great BearRainforest, approximately ten million hectares, are
destroyed eachyear. Ancient Forests such as the Amazon, and the
Paradise Forests inAsia Pacific are desperately in need of
conservation plans similar tothose announced in the Great Bear
Rainforest today. Whether worldgovernments are up to the job of
protecting them remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todaywe celebrate a magnificent victory with the thousands of
activists whostood their ground in British Columbia, every
cyberactivist who eversent an e-card or an action alert on this
issue, and the millions ofpeople worldwide who have let it be known
through their votes and theirconsumer choices that the world's
remaining ancient forests need to bepreserved. Tomorrow, we
redouble our efforts to save the many otherforests in the world
that are facing destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GreatBearVictoryStory"&gt;This was a victory won in large part by Cyberactivists the world over -- folks who signed up for a free e-zine and action alerts, who pressured governments and corporations with fax attacks and email, who learned what to buy and what not to buy to help this campaign succeed.

	In an amazing turn of events, the city of Ulsan has apparently courageously decided not to build the proposed whalemeat factory – the target of our Whale Embassy occupation.  The news of this decision was reported in a South Korean newspaper on the eve of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A paragliding pilot flies over Greenpeace and KFEM activists protesting against the proposed construction of a whale meat processing factory in Ulsan May 31, 2005. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UlsanCity Council planned to build a whale meat processing plant
inJangsaengpo, Ulsan, intending to start construction late
thisyear.  The &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/" target="_blank"&gt;Korean fisheries ministry insisted&lt;/a&gt; that this
plant was "a check-point for dealing with whale carcasses in an
environment-friendly and sanitary manner".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to newspaper reports in the South Korean
paper TheHankyoreh, the council has decided to scrap the plans
largely because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Greenpeace called the facility a whale meat factory at its website,which caused the international community to view Korea as a pro-whalingnation. The city decided that going ahead with the plan would not be inthe national interest. It also had trouble raising the fund. In theend, it decided to scrap the plan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Council will not commit to us in writing that the
factorywill not be built.  According to the same newspaper report,
a cityofficial said, "It is unprecedented that the city produces an
officialdocument confirming its decision for an NGO
[Non-GovernmentalOrganisation]. People may view such document as a
sign that the cityhas changed its policy in the face of outside
pressure. So putting thedecision in writing is unthinkable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Korean Federation for Environment Movement
issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace and KFEM are greatly encouraged by news released
today inthe South Korean publication, The Hankyoreh, that plans to
build awhalemeat factory in Ulsan, South Korea have been
scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these reports are true, Greenpeace and KFEM welcome the South
KoreanGovernment's courageous move. By scrapping the planned whale
meatfactory, the South Korean Government is showing that it does
notsupport whaling, and it does not wish to follow in the footsteps
of theJapanese Government in their determination to destroy the
world'sdwindling numbers of whales. We hope that this move towards
whaleprotection will be extended to the IWC, and that the South
KoreanGovernment will now vote in favour of whale protection and
vote againsta resumption of commercial whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the whale meat factory victory is great news,  thebattle
to save Korea's whales has not ended - this weekend sees thestart
of the IWC in Ulsan, and anotherchance for the Korean government to
prove that it really is opposed to theresumption of whaling in any
form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the virtual march!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;There's still time to make sure the IWC doesn't jeopardise the ban on commercial whaling - join the Virtual March now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us: help win more victories for whales!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.com/donation/donate.php?theme=whales&amp;amp;appeal_id=191_111"&gt;Help us achieve more victories like this by becoming a Greenpeace supporter today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Blairo Maggi has won the Golden Chainsaw award for the Brazilian person who most contributed to Amazon destruction. Sadly, rather than accept the award from his celebrity presenters, the 'Soya King' slunk out through the back door of the school he was visiting, to the taunting shouts of hundreds of children.  
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Comedians from the Brazilian TV show "Panic on TV" attempt to give the governor of Mato Grosso state, Blairo Maggi, the Golden Chainsaw award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our internet-based Golden Chainsaw award, for the Brazilian
mostresponsible for Amazon destruction, ended with 27,849 votes of
whichMaggi, the Governor of Mato Grosso state and the world's
largestindividual soya producer, received 10,348 votes (37
percent). He was followedby Brazilian President Lula da Silva, with
7,314 votes (26 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon Campaigner Paulo Adario assured us that Maggi was
adeserving winner.  "Maggi deserved the award. After two years
asthe State Governor, he has turned Mato Grosso into the State
championof deforestation, responsible for 48 percent of the total
forest loss in theBrazilian Amazon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three comedians from a popular TV show in Brazil, Pânico na TV
(Panicon TV) tried to deliver the Golden Chainsaw statuette to
Blairo Maggion Wednesday at a school in Cuiabá, capital of Mato
Grosso. However the State Governor refused to accept the award and
thepresenters were removed from the school by security.  More
than1,000 people, including hundreds of children, responded to
thiseviction by calling on Maggi to show up and accept the
statuette,shouting: "Maggi, Maggi… Accept it, accept it" and
"Protect nature."But to their disappointment, Maggi had left
through a back door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely happy to have both the artists (from Pânico na
TV) andtheir fans' support for our campaign," said Adario. "This is
yetanother way to take such an important issue as the protection of
theAmazon into people's daily lives." The Awards certainly
capturedpeoples' imaginations - the local newspaper sold a record
number ofcopies on the day of the presentation, and Pânico na TV
has an audienceof about 40 million people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other nominees for the person who most contributed to record
levelsof Amazon destruction were the Federal Ministers José Dirceu
(CivilHouse), Antonio Palocci (Treasury) and Roberto Rodrigues
(Agriculture)and the Governor of the Para State Simão Jatene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the official results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;The official results - who won, who lost, who slipped out through the back door ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now to save the Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_101"&gt;Support our ongoing campaign to halt the record levels of Amazon destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Last week Amaltal Fishing Company director Andrew Talley called Greenpeace assertions "unsubstantiated claptrap". But dramatic photos and footage taken by the Rainbow Warrior crew prove him and others supporting bottom trawling wrong.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace crew from the Rainbow Warrior captured images of
endangeredblack and red corals being hauled aboard a New Zealand
bottom trawlerin international waters near Norfolk Island.
(Although the smallercorals looks red, it is the skeleton of the
coral that is black. Thelarge red coral is a centuries-old
gorgonian tree coral.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the action on video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Again and again, we have caught the bottom trawling
industryred-handed with the evidence of deep sea destruction in
their nets. Howmany more pictures of clearfelled coral forests do
governments need tosee before they recognise that a moratorium on
bottom trawling ininternational waters is urgently needed?" said
Carmen Gravatt,Greenpeace oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="154958" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fishing industry leaders scraped the bottom of the barrel last
weekwhen they claimed bottom trawl nets didn't touch the sea floor.
Well,once again we've got the proof," said Gravatt. "We'd like to
see thefishing industry swallow their pride, realise that bottom
trawling isnot sustainable and support our calls for a UN
moratorium on bottomtrawling in international waters".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nets of the Waipori, owned by the Tasman Pacific company,
seemed tohave few fish but many pieces of the corals. Greenpeace
filmed a rangeof bottom dwelling species that were also in the haul
of the NewZealand vessel, including a rare crab.&lt;/p&gt;

are the tuatara ofthe sea, as old as dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Government delegation at last week's UN meeting

	A year since its first expedition in defence of deep sea life, the Rainbow Warrior has left Auckland to once again demonstrate the devastation caused by bottom trawling.  Last year we exposed the New Zealand and Belize-flagged bottom trawlers in the Tasman Sea ... will this year bring a repeat performance?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior sets out from Auckland to defend deep sea life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Walsh, web editor on board the Rainbow Warrior again this
year,gave the following account of the 2004 expedition that
followed theactivities of seven ships as they trawled seamounts for
target speciesof orange roughy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We watched them raising tonnes of fish, corals - and even rocks
fromthe ocean floor! Dozens of species of 'unwanted' deep sea life,
snappedfrom habitat 1000km below us, were turfed over the side of
the bottomtrawlers, internal organs blown apart from the violent
change inpressure. Hundreds of albatross - a bird usually
considered a loner,drifting at the mercy of the winds - squabbled
over the dead or dyingfish."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the huge amounts of bottom dwelling marine life including
fish,sea stars, squid, sea urchins and ghost sharks that were
hauled up anddiscarded, was a delicate branch of endangered black
coral, a specieslisted on the UN Convention on International Trade
in EndangeredSpecies (CITES) for over 20 years.  Black coral is
also protectedin adjacent New Zealand waters. Corals are the
foundation of uniquedeep-sea communities and their destruction
affects everything elseliving in or near them on the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="61560" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a press conference on board the Rainbow Warrior in
Aucklandharbour to launch the current expedition, Oceans campaigner
CarmenGravatt said "Bottom trawling is the most destructive fishing
practicein the world. The deep sea is the largest pool of
undiscovered life onEarth. Bottom trawling these unknown worlds is
like blowing up Marsbefore we get there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, in collaboration with the Scottish Association for
MarineScience (SAMS), we also concluded the exploration of a
little-knowncoral reef complex off the west of Scotland. Using
remotely operatedvehicles (small, unmanned submarines), scientists
studied anddocumented the reef, its cold water corals (lophelia
pertusa) and thenumerous species it is thought to host. Previous
surveys of the reefconducted by SAMS found that parts of the
lophelia coral formation are3,800 years old and the base may be
over 10,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, our political advisor Karen Sack will speak at a UN
meetingon Oceans.  Will the Rainbow Warrior once again unearth
crucialevidence so the UN can see with their own eyes that a
moratorium isneeded?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Each day bottom trawling continues, more deep sea life gets
wiped outand the situation becomes more critical," said Gravatt. "A
moratoriumon bottom trawling in international waters is urgently
needed toprotect life in the deep sea." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea/"&gt;Keep track of the Rainbow Warrior and find out how you can help by reading the tour weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now to protect deep sea life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_deepsea"&gt;Support us and help our campaign to protect deep sea life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.

            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you
couldstill see the occasional grand fig tree. Kids rushed up and
hugged us.I sensed that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the seeds for a safer life are already here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message to the Prime Minister&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;72% of the Turkish public wants Turkey to be nuclear-free.  Ask the Prime Minister to make it so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give peace a chance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us keep the Peace Embassy going and our activists around the world working for an end to the nuclear threat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	All the kings horses and all the kings men failed to reach agreement on reducing nuclear arms at the conclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in New York.  Now it's up to you and me.

            Greenpeace volunteers project peace messages on to the bow of the USS Blue Ridge, command ship of the US 7th Fleet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments attending the four week conference have failed to
seizethe opportunity of reducing the nuclear threat,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;putting their ownnuclear self-interests before the desire for disarmament&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;," saidGreenpeace International's Disarmament specialist William
Peden at theconference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/5/proliferation-race.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This meeting needed to strengthen the treaty and send a strong
signalon disarmament and on proliferation of nuclear weapons,"
Peden said."It has failed to do that and as a result the world is a
far moredangerous place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectre of nuclear weapons in North Korea and Israel,
USintransigence on disarmament and its imminent threat of a return
tonuclear testing, controversy over Iran, and concerns over
nuclearweapons usable plutonium production programs in Japan and
othercountries reprocessing all played a part in the collective
failure ofthe conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;“The conference gridlock only emphasises the need to bolster thedisarmament side of the process,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peden said. "Unless and until we getrid of all nuclear weapons,
other countries are going to want them -and that's the destructive
dynamic we are witnessing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's next? Heads of state attending the UN Millennium
ReviewSummit in September need to act on the challenge laid down by
UNSecretary General Kofi Annan, in his opening speech to the
conference,to take disarmament seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal by  German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;removeUS nuclear weapons from Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;was a major positive to emerge fromthe conference, and we think
all European countries that host USnuclear weapons should follow
suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Turkey, which has 90 nuclear weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.  Borderingon Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Russia, the nuclear
weapons there pose a realrisk to regional security, and ought to be
removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;  72 percent of theTurkish people want Turkey to be nuclear-free&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. Why not &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a
note tothe Prime Minister asking him to follow the will of his
people&lt;/a&gt;? We've written the letter for you, all you need to do is
fill in yourname and address and click send.  And with the push of

<item><language>en</language><title>Testing Bayer</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/testing-bayer/</url><text>
	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have visited two of the major producers of toxic chemicals at
theirplants in Belgium to pressure them to produce safer chemicals
andsupport the inclusion of obligatory 'substitution principle' (EU
speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Goodbye to climate-killing Coke machines in Japan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coke-machines-japan/</url><text>
	Coke is replacing nearly a million vending machines in Japan with units that won't use climate-damaging chemicals for refrigeration.  If Coke can do it in Japan, there's no excuse for any company in any country to be chilling their beverage at the cost of warming the globe.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/copy-of-e-card-used-by-the-cok.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/copy-of-e-card-used-by-the-cok.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Image from an E-card, part of the Cokespotlight campaign, which successfully changed Coke's policy on climate-killing refrigerants.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke isn't taking this action out of the goodness of their heart.  It took consumer pressure and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;creative lobbying by Greenpeace, Adbusters&lt;/span&gt;, and other groups to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to their credit, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coke responded energetically &lt;/span&gt;to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, our online activists took on Coca-cola for using climate-killing chemicals in the refrigeration units they were sending to the "Green" Olympics.  A &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;barrage of e-cards, e-mails, and stickers on Coke machines around the world secured a promise fromthe Coke CEO to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) &lt;/span&gt;-- a potentgreenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFCs were introduced in the late 1980s as an alternate to refrigeration using Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which were responsible for punching a hole in the protective ozone layer around the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greenpeace partnered with industry to create a technology called "Greenfreeze" which transformed the European industry&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola says that they and a collation of industry partners, including McDonald's and Unilever, have invested more than 30 million dollars to build climate-friendly vending machines. They estimate &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the switch will save 70,000 tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere by 2010&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of this victory is that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;action to save the climate is possible&lt;/span&gt;. If it can be done in one country it can be done everywhere else. If it can be done by one company, it can be done by all others. If it can be done in one industrial sector it can be done in all other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke's action is proof that companies can make the right choices for our world; and that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greenpeace's brand of online activism can help spur them to make those choices&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join the online community that made this happen&lt;/h3&gt;

	The vote is on - who is responsible for the most Amazon destruction?  Last week the Brazilian government showed that deforestation was at record levels, so we have nominated Brazilian President Lula and 5 others for the notorious Golden Chainsaw title.  "It's a very difficult choice. All six are strong candidates," said Paulo Adario, Amazon campaign co-ordinator.

            The Golden Chainsaw 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award has two prizes: public - to be decided by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;direct vote
on the internet&lt;/a&gt;- and environmental activists and journalists
will make a "critics' choice". The prizes will be given to the
Brazilianpersonality whose action or inaction were decisive in the
incrediblelevels of deforestation in the Amazon.   The
not-so-luckywinner, announced on June 6th, will receive a statue
made of illegallylogged wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor of the State of Mato Grosso, absolute champion
ofdeforestation. (The state was responsible for 48 percent of the
totalAmazon destructionduring 2003-04). Considered the "King of
Soya", he longs for thepresidency of Brazil.  Author of the
celebrated phrase, "Thisbusiness offorests does not have a
future".  And, if it depends on him, itcertainly won't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Roberto Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

thePrevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazônia"
andgreatly responsible for the lack of  its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Luís Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President of the Republic of Brazil and ultimately responsible
for itsactions and inactions. Although he promotes a sustainable
model forthe Amazon, the protection of theenvironment in his
government until now is considered a mere obstacletoeconomic
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Antônio Palocci&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of the Treasury and holder of the key to thesafe. He
compliments  agribusiness and he applaudsincreases in exports while
the government institutions andagencies who protect the environment
receive less and less federal resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Simão Jatene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor of the State of Pará which has been historically the
vice-leader in deforestation, but the winner of the prizes in
thecategories: violence and murders in the field, slave labour,
illegaloccupation of land and activities of inherent mismanagement
in theprocess of deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

            Clearcut Boreal forest in Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably haven't heard of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation but they certainly know their products. As the world's largest tissue product manufacturer it makes some of the most well known brands like Kleenex, Andrex, Scottex, Page and Hakle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://write-a-letter.greenpeace.org/130" target="_blank"&gt;Take Action now to save Canada's Boreal Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/news/features/kc-response/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Response to Kimberly-Clark's Claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these products contain fibre sourced from the ancient forests of Canada, which is why activists visited the Kimberly-Clark regional headquarters in Turin, Italy recently to demand an end to the destruction of the Boreal forests for disposable tissue products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greencenter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Following on from the protest at the company's headquarters in Turin, Italy, two activists locked their arms onto an old bus outfitted to look like a giant tissue box, and block the entrance to Kimberly-Clark's largest pulp mill in North America. The protest is the latest in Greenpeace's campaign to highlight Kimberly-Clark's irresponsible logging practices and continuing deception about these practices to consumers and investors alike. &lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/kimberly-clark-it-s-time-we-t" target="_blank"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the cuddly and soft image of Kimberly-Clark's products lies a manufacturing behemoth. In 2005 alone, Kimberly-Clark used 3.1 million metric tonnes of virgin fibre to make its products, equivalent to 135,000 truckloads. 28 percent of virgin pulp used for its products in Europe and more than 20 percent globally was sourced from ancient forests in Canada including the threatened Boreal forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such huge quantities of tree fibre aren't just a product of being a huge company; it's also due to the fact that Kimberly-Clark trails behind much of the industry in the use of recycled fibre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Cascades, North America's fourth largest tissue paper manufacturer, which uses 97 percent recycled material for its tissue products; Kimberly-Clark is well behind the pack with only 29 percent of its pulp coming from recycled sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Kimberly-Clark's best-known brands do not even contain a single strand of recycled fibre, a sad fact that is often proudly displayed on the packaging with the boast of '100 percent Virgin Fibre'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ninety percent of the logging that occurs in Canada's Boreal forest is clear-cutting, wiping out vast tracts of ancient forests to make disposable products. How can Kimberly- Clark possibly justify its support of this destruction, especially since environment-friendly alternatives exist?" asked Sergio Baffoni, Greenpeace forests campaigner from Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark could help solve the crisis in the world's ancient forests by increasing the use of recycled fibre in their entire line of products, and only purchase virgin fibre from logging operations that are sustainable and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™. So far, they have chosen to hide from their responsibility rather than address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, Canada's Boreal forest represents over 25 percent of the world's remaining intact ancient forests. This huge forest is also one of the world's largest storehouses of carbon. Every tree cut from the forest increases the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and helps to fuel climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Whaling fleet departs Japan for Antarctic hunt</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/whaling-fleet-departs-japan/</url><text>
	This year the Japanese fleet will again try to kill 935 minke and 10 fin whales off the coast of Antarctica in what the whalers are calling a "feasibility study" for expanded "research" whaling.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/11/whaling-fleet.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/11/whaling-fleet.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Japanese Fisheries Agency whaling fleet leaves  Shimonoseki, Japan bound for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with plans to harpoon 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Japan's whalers announced to the
International Whaling Commission meeting that its previous
"feasibility study" was a "complete success".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the last feasibility study was so successful, then why do
they need another one?" said John Frizell, Greenpeace International
Ocean Campaigner.  "This programme is just a flimsy excuse to push
for a resumption of commercial whaling, despite having no market
needs in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Not really about science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Whaling Commission (IWC) agreed to a
moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1986.  In
1987, Japan began its lethal "research" programme, and continues to
sell the result of this "research" in shops and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To claim this whaling program is research is an insult to
science and to the Japanese people," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace
Japan Oceans Campaign Project Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sato went on to explain, "This 'research' project is being
pursued by small numbers of politicians and bureaucrats simply to
maintain their vested interests in one of the most outdated
industries in Japan and at the expenses of Japanese taxpayers'
money".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Little support in Japan, strong opposition outside of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll in Japan carried out in June 2006 by the Gallup
affiliate, the Nippon Research Centre, showed that 95% of Japanese
never or rarely eat whale meat and more than 70 percent of Japanese
do NOT support whaling in the Southern Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of support within Japan is mirrored by widespread
condemnation from the world community.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not science - these are commercial numbers of whales,"
Australia's Environment Minister Ian Campbell was recently quoted
as saying. "This is a shameless charade, because despite the
slaughter of hundreds of whales by Japan, we have yet to see any
viable scientific results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Be an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Get updates on how you can defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Inspecting illegal nuclear weapons</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/citizen-inspections/</url><text>
	The one international treaty dedicated to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons is deadlocked by the  unwillingness of those countries which already have nuclear weapons to let the treaty do its job.  
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/the-international-court-of-jus.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/the-international-court-of-jus.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace has joined with other groups in setting up citizens inspections of illegal nuclear weapons sites around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the treaty obligates the "official"
nuclearweapons states to pursue nuclear disarmament, a US State
Departmentofficial is quoted in the National Security Newswire as
stating "we donot accept this notion that the United States must
take steps to"devalue" nuclear weapons to be in compliance."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butcountries pursuing nuclear capability like Korea and possibly
Iran arenot going to "devalue" the quest for nuclear weapons in a
world inwhich being a nuclear power like the US means the ability
to conduct aunilateral, pre-emptive war fighting strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US declared Iraq in violation of international law
over anuclear weapons programme that didn't actually exist, &lt;b&gt;the
US, andthe other nuclear weapons states, UK, France, Russia, China,
Pakistan,India, and Israel are in violation of international law
with their ownvery real arsenals&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The International Court of Justice decided in 1998 that the
threat or use of nuclear weapons is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'stherefore up to all of us to enforce the law. Greenpeace has
partneredwith other peace organisations to begin a series of
"Citizens'Inspections" of nuclear weapons sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;France&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="144291" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;Accompanied by a flotilla of 35 yachts from the Brest area, the
Greenpeace ship &lt;b&gt;Arctic Sunrise entered the military exclusion
zone around the French Military Nuclear Base at L'Isle Longue&lt;/b&gt;
near Brest on Sunday, May 15th, after announcing our intention by
radio to conduct a citizens' inspection.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had information that two of the four French nuclear-armed
submarines wereat the base during the inspection (although of
course governmentofficials never confirm or deny this kind of
information), with a totalfire power of 1000 times the Hiroshima
bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the ArcticSunrise was stopped by two French military boats,
GP France CampaignDirector Yannick Jadot, accompanied by two of the
Arctic Sunrise Crew, Erkutand Craig, continued the citizens'
inspection by inflatable zodiac,finally being stopped by a boat
full of well-armed French commandos. Atthe same time, the citizens'
inspection was backed up by 150 Greenpeacesupporters and local
activists, as well as members of the ArcticSunrise crew, who
marched to the front entrance of the nuclear base,demonstrating
against the continued presence of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;"Wegot to within 100 meters of a
nuclear armed submarine" said YannickJadot "in an unarmed
inflatable raft.  Nuclear weapons cannot bemade secure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Belgium&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="122271" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;InApril
our activists joined with regular Bombspotting activists toinspect
three military facilities in Belgium, with the aim ofpressuring
NATO member states to renounce their nuclear weaponsarsenal.  The
inspections took place at Kleine Brogel Air basewhich houses
nuclear weapons, NATO's Brussels Headquarters and itsSHAPE military
headquarters in Mons/Bergen.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1000 activists showed up to carry out the inspection. 500
bombspotters were arrested.&lt;/b&gt; A massive police presence greeted
inspectors from Greenpeace and Bombspotting at NATO- HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Australia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/features/images/nu_citizens_inspection.jpg" align="left" height="105" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="140"&gt;Mayor Murray Matson led a Citizens Weapons Inspection
team of local dignataries and Greenpeace activists to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/features/features_details.html?site_id=45&amp;amp;news_id=1552"&gt;
Lucas Heights to check on secretive research into uranium
enrichment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wewere always told this was a medical research facility...
while thisstory was being told to us, all along there was another
type ofresearch going on, uranium enrichment, that is conducive to
producingnuclear weapons," said Dr Tilman Ruff, president-elect of
the MedicalAssociation for the Prevention of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Matson is a member of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/is-your-mayor-for-peace/"&gt;
Mayors for Peace,&lt;/a&gt; an initiative begun by the mayor of Hiroshima
to abolish nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Turkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="144096" mode="story"&gt;InTurkey
we've established a semi-permanent inspection facility about
50meters from the entrance to the Incirlik NATO Air Base near
Adana: thePeace Embassy.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polling data in Turkey has shown that less thanhalf of the
population is aware that US nuclear weapons are actuallypresent in
their country, and 72% support Turkey being a nuclear freezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThisPeace Embassy is being established at a time when a report
beingdiscussed by the US Congress could result in additional US
nuclearweapons being stationed in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;These US nuclear weapons stationed in Turkey are a danger to regional &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;stability and global security&lt;/span&gt;",says Aslýhan Tümer,
our Nuclear Disarmament  campaigner in theMediterranean, "We're
bearing witness, and calling on Prime minister Erdogan to say no to
any US nuclear weapons in Turkey"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThePeace Embassy has created a weblog which they will maintain
throughouttheir presence.  As Ertank noted in one post: "Incirlik
is astrange town. The only means of economy is the Americans. There
is nosingle shop with a Turkish name here. They work for the
American troopsand their wives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Escalating pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, along with Bombspotting and othercitizen inspection
groups, will be escalating their pressure on thecountries owning
and hosting nuclear weapons as we move closer to the60th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Weare part of a growing network of people who will continue to conductthese inspections,"&lt;/span&gt;
said our campaigner Nicky Davies. "We're callingupon all our
supporters and activists to join in increasing thepressure on the
nuclear weapons states to abolish nuclear weapons."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help by &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;writing
today to the Prime Minister to ask that Turkey become
nuclear-free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In a report just published, the International Energy Agency  promotes nuclear power as the solution which will save us from global warming. But who will save us from nuclear power?
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/nuclearcrack.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/nuclearcrack.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint a symbolic crack on dome at the Tihange Nuclear Plant in Belgium. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) was set up as a Western
counterpart to OPEC, with the aim of "controlling and regulating
the oil stocks" of its developed-country membership. The IEA's
approach to energy has lacked imagination for as long as it has
existed and its analysis perpetuates antiquated thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in nuclear power is a sure way to lose the battle
against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same carbon savings, nuclear power costs up to ten times
as much as energy efficiency measures. It creates huge security and
environmental threats that will last for tens of thousands of
years. It contributes to the birth of nuclear weapons states like
North Korea. It creates tantalising targets for terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah North, Greenpeace energy campaigner, says "Nuclear sucks
crucial investment from genuine solutions, like decentralised
energy, renewables and energy efficiency. Global warming needs a
global solution, but unless we want every dictator in the world to
have access to enriched uranium, nuclear power can't be that
solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's just a handful of flaws in the IEA report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear power only produces electricity, and thus only
marginally deals with our need for services such as hot water and
central heating, and doesn't meet our energy needs for transport at
all. Instead of focusing solely on electricity production,
governments need to address the energy system as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;US researchers from the respected Rocky Mountain Institute have
estimated that for the same investment, energy efficiency can
achieve up to ten times more carbon savings than nuclear
power.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The IEA's nuclear plan would require more than 200 new reactors
in the next 24 years. Climate scientists warn we have ten years to
act.  Nuclear power plants that come on line in 2025 to 2030 will
begin replacing coal and oil too late to meet the short term need
for emission reductions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The capital and subsidies for such an unrealistic expansion
would be so huge that they would strangle investment in renewables
and energy-efficiency, which the world desperately needs. Nuclear
would prevent the very change the IEA is calling for.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The report grossly underestimates the ready potential of energy
efficiency and renewable energy - which already play a larger role
than the IEA projects for nuclear power in 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IEA report calls for radical action, but only offers
"business as usual" solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is: there's a better way than that offered by the
IEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the IEA plan, it is possible to cut emissions by
half by 2050 and meet everyone's energy supply needs without new
nuclear power or carbon capture and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maximizing energy efficiencies and renewable energies, we can
supply the energy we need sustainably, safely and economically -
all while averting dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, nuclear power is unnecessary, it's uneconomical and

            Sydney voters call for clean renewable energy during the 'walk against warming'. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people joined the global day of climate action on
Nov 4 todemand decisive steps to combat the biggest threat to the
planet.  Here'sa quick snapshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Australia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge crowds of more than 80,000 joined the 2006 Walk Against
Warmingaround Australia. From Melbourne to Maitland, Canberra to
Cairns, andeverywhere in between, voters with one voice urged the
Howardgovernment to take action against climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/walkagainstwarming/show/"&gt;More

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25,000 people packed into London's Trafalgar Square. We were
gatheredto make a call for action on climate change - everyone from
the Women'sInstitute to the rock band Razorlight. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/icount/show/"&gt;More images

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop Global Warming message formed to issue a call to action
forFlorida congressional candidates to take immediate steps
todramatically reduce global warming pollution and protect Florida
fromclimate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global protests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gallery.globalclimatecampaign.org/n4global"&gt;Protests
large and small&lt;/a&gt; took place across the globe from Sofia
toSydney. Activism has been brought new urgency by the release in
the UK of the &lt;a href="http://hm-treasury.gov.uk./independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm"&gt;
Stern Report&lt;/a&gt;,the review by British economist and government
advisor Sir NicholasStern which calls climate change "the greatest
and widest-rangingmarketfailure ever seen," and calculates the cost
of action now to reducecarbon as being a fraction of what the cost
of inaction will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Future generations will not forgive us if we delay"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But will governments listen to the unified voices of the
people,scientists, and economists all over the world?  According to
SteveSawyer, ourClimate &amp;amp; Energy Policy Advisor:  "The
legal,moral, and political obligations of the rich countries are
clear: theymust dramatically reduce their emissions and at the same
time beprepared to provide massive support to help the poorest
countries adaptto the climate change that we are already committed
to."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Only the next two weeks will show if there is real global politicalwill to tackle climate change or if politicians again choose to talkinstead of act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=Signupclimateactionday"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine for online and offline actions you can take to help stop global warming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Donateclimateactionday"&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions.

	We here at Greenpeace pride ourselves in getting into places we're not supposed to be, like nuclear power plants and weapons test sites.  So it really, really hurts to get kicked out of something like the Mac Expo -- where we had permission to attend!  All we want is better environmental policies from Apple: is that so heretical that we get thrown out?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/greenpeace-volunteers-man-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/greenpeace-volunteers-man-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Why was this woman evicted from Mac Expo?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers had set up a stall to sign up fellow Mac fans in the effort to get Apple to go green. We handed out some flyers.  We handed out some organic green apples. We talked to lots of cool people about how uncool it was for Apple to be neglecting their environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tom Dowdall &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2006/10/we_love_our_macs_but_mac_expo.html"&gt; writes over on the Making Waves blog&lt;/a&gt;, "most visitors were very interested and showed support for the campaign by signing up online or writing to Steve. But it seems other exhibitors were not so happy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International campaigner at the expo, says "Apple should be a world leader in the greening of the electronics industry, not lagging behind."  Why would we expect anything less of the world's coolest company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Bottom of the barrel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple scored 11th place (out of 14) on a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/green-electronics-guide-ewaste250806/"&gt; 'Guide to Greener Electronics'&lt;/a&gt; recently released by Greenpeace, with a poor showing on almost all criteria.  The company fails to embrace the precautionary principle, withholds its full list of regulated substances, provides no timelines for eliminating toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and no commitment at all to phasing out all uses of brominated flameretardants (BFRs).  Ok, we know. That's a lot of letters. Bottom line: Apples contain poisonous stuff that ends up in China and India as e-waste, and which other computer manufacturers have committed to get rid of.  When iPods, Macs and other items in the Apple product range get thrown away, most get disassembled, melted, and picked apart by kids with no health and safety protection. NOT cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple reports on the amount of its electronic waste that gets recycled, which is a good thing.  And they do take back computers in the US for proper recycling. But worldwide, their policies on taking back products from their customers are in the back of the pack by industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for Apple to use clean components in all of its products and to provide a free take-back program to reuse and recycle its products wherever they are sold. We are challenging the world leader in design to also be a world leader in environmental innovation. We challenge Apple to have a product range on the market by 2007 which is free of the worst toxic chemicals." says Iza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The customer is always right. And the customer wants green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's the rich part. The exhibition hall may have kicked Greenpeace out, but Mac Expo is FULL of people campaigning for a greener Apple.  They're called Apple Customers. To date, more than 155,000 people have visited the Green my Apple site.  Over 1000 blogs are linking to it.  And 12,000 Apple fans have written to Steve Jobs asking him to change Apple's ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on, Steve. Anybody can pollute the planet.  Apple can think different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=expoevictiondonatelink"&gt;We don't take money from governments or corporations -- so we don't have to worry about biting the hands that feed us.  But that means we need YOUR help even more when we're fighting for the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In Iceland, the whale watching industry contributes more to the national economy than commercial whaling did before it was put on hold in the '80s.  Yet now, after 17 years, Iceland has officially resumed commercial whaling.  
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Icelandic Fisheries Ministry issued a permit to hunt
39 whales for commercial purposes.  Nine of these are endangered
fin whales - putting to lie claims that the hunt is sustainable.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Icelandic whale processing factory is also reportedly
being put back into service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to today, Norway was the only country openly conducting
commercial whaling.  Japan conducts a large yearly hunt using the
pretence of "scientific whaling" to keep its industry alive.  Since
2003, Iceland has also engaged in so called "scientific whaling". 
In both cases the meat is sold, mostly as a luxury food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box blue" style="padding: 5px; margin-right: 5px; width: 170px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, 21 October 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lone Icelandic whale hunter licensed to kill 39 whales made
his first kill today: an endangered Fin whale. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/slideshows/endangered-fin-whale-killed-in?po"&gt;
(Pictures here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no economic or scientific justification for commercial
whaling. The fact that the first kill was an endangered whale makes
a nonsense ofclaims that the hunt is sustainable," says our
campaigner JohnFrizell. "Iceland has no market for whale meat
internationally and almost none domestically. This hunt is no more
than pointless posturing, which achieves nothing except the further
depletion of an endangered species," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Iceland hunt, next month the Japanese whaling
fleet will sail to Southern Ocean, with plans to kill nearly 1,000
whales - including endangered Fin whales.  Japan has announced
plans to begin hunting humpbacks in future as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The question of why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristjan Loftsson, managing director of the Icelandic whaling
company, is said to be "pleased" about receiving the hunt permit. 
But the question remains: why kill whales?  Why try to revive a
dying industry with a long history of deception and
mismanagement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a glut of unwanted meat in Iceland, Norway and Japan. 
In Iceland, they haven't even sold the meat from earlier
"scientific" hunts.  There simply is not much of a market for the
stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gallup poll, commissioned by IFAW and released last month,
found that, "Only 1.1 percent of Icelanders eat whale meat once a
week or more, while 82.4 percent of 16 to 24-year-olds never eat
whale meat."  Not very optimistic numbers for a business
venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Whale watching and how you can help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland has a choice.  Most Icelanders are environmentally
conscious, and in favour of using marine resources in a way that
preserves them for future generations.  Its whale watching industry
is known around the world, and brings in more revenue than whaling
possibly could.  Yet, the Fisheries Ministry has done a favour for
a very small interest group, and granted a permit for commercial
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This permit should be revoked before the first whale is killed. 
You can help by signing the Icelandic pledge.  Tens of thousands of
people have pledged to consider visiting Iceland as tourists and
whale watchers, but only AFTER the whale killing ends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/stop-icelandic-whaling"&gt;Lend your voice to Icelandic people opposing whaling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showthread.php?p=39#post39" class="act"&gt;Discuss this article in  "Louder than Words," the

	Fishing and prostitution might be the two oldest professions. But the exploitation of both is creating new vulnerabilities for Pacific islands as the whole world increasingly comes to fish in its waters. Ben Bohane reports from Kiribati.

            A mother and her child wait for Sunday mass to begin in a Catholic church in Tarawa. The heads of the two major churches in Kiribati have renewed criticism of local women boarding foreign fishing vessels. The church leaders said they are worried about the spread of prostitution.

            A baby sleeping in a Betio slum. The problem of increasing prostitution is linked to a number of factors.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deck of the Taiwanese purse-seiner bustles with activity. At
anchora few kilometres off Tarawa in Kiribati, tons of skipjack
tuna arelifted from a refrigerated hold up onto the sweltering
topdeck fortranshipment to a ship moored beside it. Whistles blow,
nets ofshimmering fish are raised and swung onto the mothership,
which willtake its cargo to canneries in Papua New Guinea and
Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butlook closer and another small transhipment is also taking
place betweenthe two rolling boats. A young girl is gingerly easing
herself downthick ropes from the mothership onto the purse-seiner.
It is a delicatebalancing act 20 metres above water and for a
moment she looks like atrapeze artist, walking the tightrope. She
smiles at one of theTaiwanese crew as she drops like a cat onto the
deck and disappearsinto a nearby cabin. Here in Kiribati she is
known as a "korakorea"girl; a girl who spends time with
fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Not as romantic as it seems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inthe Pacific, the practice of sweet young girls paddling out to
foreignboats to introduce their charms to restless seamen is
nothing new, itis almost a cliché of Pacific history. European
sailors were fond ofdropping anchor in places like Tahiti knowing
they would be "warmlywelcomed" after long and lonely months at sea.
Such women helped causemutiny on the Bounty, and much else to
inspire romantic notions inEurope that the Pacific islands were an
Eden of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Althoughthe practice continues today, there is little romance
and far moredangers involved for the girls - the spectre of AIDS
andsocial/psychological consequences of girls as young as 12
involvedgives the fishing industry a dark side that is rarely
contemplated whenconsumers open a tin of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, there are growingsocial consequences as a result of
a rapacious fishing industry worthan estimated US$2.7 billion per
year. More than half the world's tuna,about 2 million tons per
year, now comes from the Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why the world is coming to the Pacific for fish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThePacific ocean holds the world's last great fish supply -
since many ofthe world's oceans have been substantially overfished
in recentdecades. The EU, after enforcing a moratorium on cod
fishing in theAtlantic which put much of the European fleet on dry
dock, has recentlysigned a number of bi-lateral deals with Pacific
island states to fishin their waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe now sources much of its tuna from thePacific - in
Germany, for example, half the tuna consumed there comesfrom
Kiribati alone. The EU fleet now joins China, Taiwan, Japan,Russia,
America, The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and others whoare
ranging far into the Pacific, often unmonitored, to harvest
schoolsof fish (mainly tuna) on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Korakorea girls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/a-mother-and-her-child-wait-fo.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;Asin most places, prostitution is hardly
a modern phenomenon.  InKiribati, the term "korakorea" was first
coined to describe local girlswho went aboard Korean fishing
vessels, but is now more generally usedfor girls going onboard
fishing boats from any country as well as beingslang for "cheap
fish".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many do it because of poverty at homeand the chance to earn
money, clothes and fish to take home. Some girlsget pressured by
their families to do it. Others claim they do it sothey can get
"drinking money for their friends" and because the foreignfishermen
treat them better than their local men do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isno law against prostitution in Kiribati, which was
highlighted recentlywhen 80 girls were rounded up and brought
before a local court beforebeing released. Yet there is growing
concern that Kiribati maybebreaching international conventions on
child protection since many ofthe girls are only 14 and 15 years of
age. UNICEF is preparing torelease a damning document relating to
underage prostitution in severalPacific countries, including
Kiribati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Kathy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One girl involved in the trade, "Kathy", claims girls as young
as 12 are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Iknow about one 12 year old girl who was taken out to a fishing
boat byher aunty and she has disappeared. Her family are very
worried sinceshe has been missing now for 4 months".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy is a pretty 21year old girl who lives with her father, an
unemployed formergovernment worker, in a crowded settlement near
the Betio port on southTarawa. She claims there are many local
girls involved in the trade andthey all have different
motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It all depends becausesome they really need money to support
their families with food, sothey feel some pressure. Other girls
need money to buy drinks forthemselves and friends when they want
to go out to the bars".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathysays that even though their have been crackdowns by local
authoritiesthe girls are not scared of getting caught by police
because "theirfamily are supporting them".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Taking advantage of history and attitudes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/baby-slum.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;Thisis what makes prostitution in
Kiribati and other Pacific islands acomplex issue. For many Pacific
cultures it is not a big deal; sex,custom and fishing are all
intertwined, subject to tabus. Manyislanders do not view such
exchanges as "prostitution". Fishing and sexhave long been linked
to traditions that were, in itself, notnecessarily a bad thing,
because everything was shared withincommunities and remote islands
needed "new blood" to prevent inbreedingand keep the tribe strong
to defend from raiding enemies. Ritualexchanges of things like fish
and women kept the peace amongneighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kiribati, as a recent UNICEF document points out,
prostitution is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In1826 prostitutes were referred to as Nikiranroro, meaning
those who hadlost their virginity or had eloped. Whalers were much
criticised andblamed for having increased prostitution in the
islands...and thatvenereal disease was said to have been more
widespread after whalingcontacts".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Modern times&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/kiribati-dance.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;AsPresident of the Kiribati National
Council of Women (AMAK), Mere agreesthe korakorea issue is a
complex one, but believes that young girlsshould be in school and
better guided by their parents or guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Itis an issue here because it is against our culture and
tradition. Inthe olden days, at age 14 or 15, girls were kept in
the home doing workthat assured your future life as a woman and
they were very restrictedin their night time outings. But now
Kiribati is in the swell ofglobalisation and the issue of
korakorea...well, that's how thingshappen now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernity, a cash economy and the loss of traditionhas created
new vulnerabilities for coastal communities of the Pacific.Legal
and illegal fishing by foreign vessels have introduced a range
ofsocial problems apart from the environmental impact of depleted
fishstocks. Mere believes there is a "dangerous cycle" linking
alcoholabuse, violence, sexual abuse and disease that is afflicting
manyPacific nations including her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities that once sharedeverything now find a new rich/poor
divide is splitting them and AIDSis an ever present danger.
According to the HIV AIDS clinic at TarawaGeneral Hospital,
Kiribati (population 92,000) has 43 confirmed AIDScases of which 26
have already died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'd say almost all thecases of AIDS here are related to the
fishing industry" claims one ofthe nurses testing blood samples.
"It is coming from both foreignfishermen and our own sailors
returning home".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;More enforcement tools needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/linda-taiwan-boat.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;DavidYee Ting, Kiribati's Permanent
Secretary for Fisheries, claims that thegovernment is getting on
top of the situation, saying, "Our new PoliceCommissioner has been
enforcing the laws to stop girls - and those whohelp them - go out
to the boats."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He confirms that the situationgot so bad that for a period in
2003, Kiribati actually banned allKorean fishing boats from
entering Kiribati ports after reports in theKorean Herald that
30-50 girls, mostly underage, were servicing theKorean
fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he thought Kiribati was alsogetting ripped off on
its core asset, fisheries, Ting says "That's abit harsh, but yes,
we could be getting a better return. We only haveone patrol boat
and we don't have many trained fisheries officers whocan be
stationed on boats to monitor catches."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But as Pacificstates come together through regional bodies like
the FFA (ForumFisheries Authority, based in Solomon Islands) and
the WCPFC (Westernand Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, based
in Marshall Islands), Ibelieve we will have more collective power
to get a better deal on ourfish resources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ting is upbeat about the recent deal signedbetween the EU and
Kiribati, believing the EU will help develop thelocal industry with
more local employment and training. Other observersare not so
sanguine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we should have vessels from5,000 miles away
fishing here. Why are they fishing here? Because theyhave stuffed
their own region and now they are coming down here to doit" is the
blunt assessment of Captain David Lucas, manager of SolanderPacific
Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've got purse-seiners from the European Unionfishing in
Kiribati. Why should they be down here? What have they doneto their
own? Who's next?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the Esperanza weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/"&gt;Find out what's happening right now in the Defending Our Oceans expedition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>One fish, two fish, red fish, glofish?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/one-fish-two-fish-glofish/</url><text>
	The biotechnology industry has struggled for the last twenty years to come up with products that work, and propaganda to sell those products. Remember the FlavrSavr tomato, the first genetically engineered (GE) food product designed to ripen on the vine, yet stay firm all the way to market? Well, it hardly lasted the first truck ride across the country, as it really wasn't all that squash proof.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Glofish may be the first genetically engineered pets but with no rules to control them who knows what will happen?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as consumers around the world rejected newer GE food
crops, likeUS maize, the biotech industry came up with a novel
propagandacampaign. They are now spending millions of dollars to
convince us thatGE is an essential technology for feeding poor
people in the developingworld (never mind that most of the GE crops
currently grown are used tofeed animals, not humans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest GE product to hit the shelves illuminates the fact
thatthis technology has little to do with feeding people. Genetic
engineershave made a zebra fish that glows in the dark - the
GloFish. Of course,we wouldn't be surprised to hear the GE industry
claim that GloFishwill feed the world, revolutionise pet ownership,
and help find carkeys lost in dark aquariums the world over...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What's all the fuss about a little aquarium fish?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetically engineered organisms are novel creatures - they've
neverbefore existed on the planet. We have no way of predicting
what havocthey will cause when they are released into the wild.
Scientists havestudied what other GE fish species might do and
their conclusions areworrying - depending on the fish, GE varieties
could invade ecosystems,threaten populations of native species, or
cause other unpredictabledamage. Aquarium fish get introduced into
native ecosystems all thetime, and can survive in the warmer waters
of some springs and aroundindustrial wastewater pipes, so this
really is no laughing matter. Anyescape would be irreversible - the
escaped fish could not be recalledlike a supermarket product can be
recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Glofish are not for eating but who told the cat?" title="Glofish are not for eating but who told the cat?" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56017"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;ToddGrischke,
fisheries supervisor at the Michigan Department of
NaturalResources, likened genetically engineered fish to an
invasive species."You threaten entire ecosystems," he said. "You
don't know how thosenew animals are going to behave in the wild.
They could cause ouroriginal stocks to die off. They could be
susceptible to diseaseoutbreaks. They could change their life cycle
patterns. Who knows?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California has recently banned the sale of GloFish in the
state.Fish and Game Commissioner Sam Schuchat explained the
decision thisway: "Creating a novelty pet is a frivolous use of
this technology. Nomatter how low the risk is, there needs to be a
public benefit that ishigher than this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;But is it a fish or is it a drug?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing as it may seem, there is no agency of the US Government
thatconsiders itself responsible for evaluating the risks of GE
aquariumfish. A few years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration
(US-FDA)announced that they would regulate such fish as animal
drugs. But whenthe company selling the fish, Yorktown Technologies,
submitted a NewAnimal Drug Application to the US-FDA this year for
GloFish approval,the agency backed away from its claim to regulate
aquarium fish anddeclined to consider the application stating that
the fish was not adrug. (Those bureaucrats clearly have a firm
grasp on the obvious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget for a moment the absurdity of regulating an aquarium fish
asa drug. Regulatory agencies sometimes make bizarre definitional
leapsin order to use already existing laws to regulate completely
newproducts - like glow-in-the-dark zebra fish. What the FDA
decisionmeans is that the fish is now being sold in stores in the
US withabsolutely no review of its potential to cause damage to
theenvironment. In deciding not to regulate the fish, the US-FDA
hascreated a regulatory vacuum of immense proportions - there is
now nofederal agency responsible for assessing whether these fish,
or anyfuture genetically engineered pets, may pose environmental or
otherproblems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not to make a pun, but I think it's shedding a light on
seriousregulatory and safety issues that are not getting much
attention," saidArt Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at
the University ofPennsylvania. "This is going to be a very
important issue. The fish isjust the first wave on the beach."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 14, 2004, the Center for Food Safety and the Center
forTechnology Assessment filed a lawsuit against the US Food and
DrugAdministration and its parent agency, the US Department of
Health andHuman Services, to block the sale of the GloFish. The
lawsuitrepresents the first-ever legal action seeking to block the
sale of agenetically engineered animal. The lawsuit also asks the
court todecide that the US-FDA must regulate genetically engineered
pets.&lt;/p&gt;

	North Korea became the ninth nuclear power at 10:35 local time (0135 GMT) on Monday when it detonated an undergound nuclear test.  Their success is the world's failure.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kim Jong-il featured as a card in Greenpeace's "Most Wanted" nuclear solitaire deck, distributed at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in the year 2000.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going nuclear, North Korea has highlighted the weakness of
the non-proliferation treaty. Pyongyang has underscored the
dangerous connection between nuclear research, nuclear power and
nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're calling for a restrained reaction from other countries,
such as South Korea, Japan and the United States, and a
re-convening of the six-party talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants yet another country to have a nuclear arsenal, but
with over 5,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenal of the United States
of America, the relative balance of power has to be kept in mind.
It's bad enough that North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon, but
it will be worse if other countries don't talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;How to become a nuclear weapons state: step one, get nuclear power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of North Korea's pursuit of the bomb is a cautionary
tale about the dual use of nuclear power and the failures of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country was given reactor technology and expertise by
several countries, had made the mandatory promises to use that
power for energy, not weapons, and until a few years ago allowed
inspectors to verify it was so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time someone tells you that nuclear power is "clean and
safe"ask them how North Korea was able to convert their reactors
into bombfactories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;From Atoms for Peace to atomic weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea was suspected of pursuing an active weapons program
up to 1994, when it signed an agreement with the US to freeze all
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in December 2002 it restarted its nuclear reactor at
Yongbyon. Monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) were expelled, and in January 2003, North Korea declared its
withdrawal from the international Non-Proliferation Treaty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2003 Pyongyang announced it had completed the
reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods to extract weapons-grade
plutonium and was developing a "nuclear deterrent." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2005 North Korea announced it had produced nuclear
weapons, but it has not, to date, conducted a test detonation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven other nations have demonstrated their nuclear
capabilities: The US, The Russian Federation, the UK, France,
China, India, and Pakistan.  Israel is known to have nuclear
weapons but has never admitted as much, and never claimed
responsibility for an explosive nuclear test.  And due tothe
widespread use of nuclear energy  about 40 other countries
haveaccess to nuclear weapons material and therefore possess the
abilityto develop nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One arms control expert, Dr. Jeffery Lewis &lt;a href="http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1167/nork-nuke-test-site"&gt;published
details online&lt;/a&gt; in August ofthis year of the test site near
Kilju/Kilchu.  His &lt;a href="http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/file_download/50"&gt;analysis of
Google Earth Satellite imagery of the site is available here&lt;/a&gt;
(you'll need to have Google Earth installed for that link to
work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/images/725.jpg" height="322" width="430"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;A new Asian arms race?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea's new nuclear capability threatens to destabilize
the entire region.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korea has expressed an interest in obtaining stockpiles of
plutonium similar to those in Japan, where one of the world's
largest repositories of nuclear weapons material sits side-by-side
with some of the world's most advanced missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear club ought to be getting smaller, and it would be if
thenuclear weapons states were to live up to their commitments to
rid theworld of nuclear weapons.  That was the deal of the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/international-solutions/npt/"&gt;
Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, but while the US and other nuclear
powers are quick to demand full compliance by the non-nuclear
weapons states, they've done little to fulfil their part of the
bargain: a Comprehensive  Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and concrete
steps toward nuclear disarmament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test ban treaty has been negotiated but remains unratified by
the US, China and Israel, among others.  The number of nuclear
weapons in the world today remains on par with the number of
weapons which existed when the Non-Proliferation Treaty was
negotiated in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=SignupNTestKorea"&gt;Sign up for our e-zine for online and offline actions you can take to help stop nuclear power and nuclear weapons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=DonateNTestKorea"&gt;Donate to Greenpeace to help us work for a green and peaceful planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today is the 9th Anniversary of Kim Jong-il as North Korean leader.  We think that the best way to celebrate nine years as the leader of a country which has not detonated a nuclear weapon is to try and stretch that to ten: the world needs fewer nuclear powers, not more.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kim Jong-il featured as a card in Greenpeace's "Most Wanted" nuclear solitaire deck, distributed at the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of North Korea's pursuit of the bomb is a cautionary
tale about the dual use of nuclear power.  The country was given
reactor technology and expertise by several countries, had made the
mandatory promises to use that power for energy, not weapons, and
until a few years ago allowed inspectors to verify it was so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking news: &lt;strong&gt;North Korean detonates nuclear
weapon:&lt;/strong&gt; By going nuclear, North Korea has highlighted the
weakness of the non-proliferation treaty. Pyongyang has underscored
the dangerous connection between nuclear research, nuclear power
and nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/north-korean-nuclear-test-cond/" class="act"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time someone tells you that nuclear power is "clean and
safe"ask them how North Korea was able to convert their reactors
into bombfactories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;From Atoms for Peace to atomic weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea was suspected of pursuing an active weapons program
up to 1994, when it signed an agreement with the US to freeze all
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in December 2002 it restarted its nuclear reactor at
Yongbyon. Monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) were expelled, and in January 2003, North Korea declared its
withdrawal from the international Non-Proliferation Treaty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2003 Pyongyang announced it had completed the
reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods to extract weapons-grade
plutonium and was developing a "nuclear deterrent." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2005 North Korea announced it had produced nuclear
weapons, but it has not, to date, conducted a test detonation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven nations have demonstrated their nuclear capabilities: The
US, The Russian Federation, the UK, France, China, India, and
Pakistan.  Israel is known to have nuclear weapons but has never
admitted as much, and never claimed responsibility for an explosive
nuclear test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;A new Asian arms race?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea does test a nuclear weapon, it threatens to
destabilize the entire region.  Tensions on the Korean Peninsular
will rise, and a new nuclear arms race could start in South East
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has expressed an interest in obtaining stockpiles of
plutonium similar to those in Japan, where one of the world's
largest repositories of nuclear weapons material sits side-by-side
with some of the world's most advanced missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear club ought to be getting smaller, and it would be if
thenuclear weapons states were to live up to their commitments to
rid theworld of nuclear weapons.  That was the deal of the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/international-solutions/npt/"&gt;
Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ratherthan testing a nuclear weapon, Kim Jong-il should
celebrate theoccasion by taking a step towards a nuclear free
world," says SteveShallhorn, Executive Director of Greenpeace
Australia Pacific. "As longas some countries have nuclear weapons
other countries will inevitablyseek to achieve them. Not only
should North Korea refrain from thistest and renounce its nuclear
weapons programme, so should each andevery one of the other nuclear
weapons states."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Kim Jong-il celebrates, we're urging him to forego the
nuclear fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;

	It was a beautiful star gazing night last night and almost everyone was out on deck. The moon rose late and the lights on deck were off because we are in transit. In the distance, against the silhouette of the forest, there was an orange glow. Coca said I hope that is the moon. I said, it isn't. I've seen it many times before on this trip, the warm orange glow on the horizon accompanied by a smoky haze in the sky. The distinct smell of burning wood hung in the air.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The US based Cargill corporation burns large areas of rainforest  to prepare for soya plantations.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past week we documented huge deforested areas in
Santarem, many still on fire, all being cleared for soya
plantations. The aerial images confirm that the attack of private
companies on the forest continues out of control and we delivered
the images to the federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Brazil's soya market is fuelling an emerging
cycle of deforestation. Over three-quarters of a million hectares
of soya was planted within the Amazon deforestation belt by the end
of 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three forces are driving soya expansion in Para state - low land
prices, the lack of funding for an effective government inspection
infrastructure, and the construction of Cargill's soya handling
facilities in Santarem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But federal prosecutors just announced that they will launch
legal action in the federal courts calling for demolition of
Cargills' soya handling facilities in Santarem. The federal
prosecutors will also ask for the immediate suspension of the US
corporation's activities in Santarem until the courts reach their
decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Artic Sunrise in front of illegal soya processing plant." title="Artic Sunrise in front of the US based Cargill corporation's illegal soya processing plant. Cargill is fuelling the burning of the forest for soya plantations." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="55306"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Under
Brazilian law the construction of the Cargill facility required
prior preparation and approval of an Environmental Impact
Assessment. Instead of complying, they chose to contest this
requirement in the courts. After four years of court challenges,
late last month the Court of Final Instance ruled unanimously
against Cargill. However, in the interim, the multinational giant
constructed their facility in Santarem's main beach, in violation
of the law. Twenty-five families were displaced in the construction
of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the announcement, Federal Prosecutor Felicio Pontes said
"Cargill believed that because they were a powerful multinational,
they could disrespect both Brazilian legislation and the
environment. The court decision shows that they were wrong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way to go federal prosecutors - a victory for the people and the
forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the completion of the Cargill facility, one hectare of
rural land in the region cost R$50 (US$13). With the arrival of
"gauchos", as the soya producers are called, the price per hectare
skyrocketed to R$900 (US$300). Entire rural communities were
displaced, the inhabitants having sold their land rights and moved
to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our ongoing field investigations, we believe that
deforestation this year will be even higher than last year. There
is a growing and very dangerous trend appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally cattle ranchers would move into areas that loggers
had exploited, and clear the land for pastures. Empirical data now
indicates that cattle ranchers continue to push into new areas that
are being deforested, after exhaustive exploitation by loggers,
later selling the areas to the soya producers. At the same time the
soya producers are burning large tracts of the forest solely for
conversion to large-scale agriculture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="forest burning for in prepartion for soya planting." title="The US based Cargill corporation burns large areas of rainforest to prepare for soya plantations." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="55303"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Between
August 2001 and August 2002 deforestation in Brazil's Amazon
increased 40 percent compared to the previous 12 months. Analysis
of satellite images by the National Institute of Space Research
(INPE) show that the destruction dramatically expanded beyond what
is known as the "Arc of Deforestation" - that runs from the east
and south of Para state towards Acre state - and is cutting deeper
and deeper into the heart of the untouched forest. According to the
Ministry of Environment, this deforestation is a direct result of
the invasion of soya producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burning question the government must answer: do they want to
contain deforestation, support and promote sustainable
alternatives, and strengthen the Ministry of Environment, or lose
immense areas of the Amazon to predatory exploitation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, the fires rage on.&lt;/p&gt;

	It was a tough year for the planet, and our retrospective shows plenty of cause for concern, but reason for hope and celebration as well. Look back at the protests against the war in Iraq where millions took to the streets, see how an Amazon community protected their forest land, witness the destruction of forest fires and floods in southern Europe in just 6 months and a birds eye view of protecting the tallest trees in the world.

	Our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, has been exposing the sharp end of environmental exploitation - the ship breaking beaches of India. However rather than taking action to prevent these crimes the local Indian authorities have responded by preventing the docking of the Rainbow Warrior and have now put the crew under house arrest. Read what it was like to finally dock in Mumbai from crewmember Evedien.

            Crew of the Rainbow Warrior keeping their spirits up. Currently the crew is confined to the ship by port authorities.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why we are currently having so many problems here
in India I'll start my story a few weeks ago. We came here to show
how rich countries are dumping toxic waste in disguise -- in the
form of old ships headed for scrap in Alang, India. We want rich
countries to clean the ships of hazardous waste before they are
sent to countries like India - so making it a safer practice for
the local workers and the environment. However the powerful
shipbreaking industry, backed by the shipowners, has misrepresented
our intentions and influenced local and regional politicians to
start making problems for us. This inspite of the fact that we were
at the same time cooperating with federal Indian authorities in
London at a UN meeting on laws of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Leaving Alang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Nov 26:&lt;/span&gt; It all looked
fine as we lifted the anchor, set the sails and started our voyage
back to Bombay. There wasn't much wind, but it felt great to move
again. We've been at anchor for about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Nov 27:&lt;/span&gt; We arrived at the
25 mile zone from Mumbai. We had to wait here until our paperwork
was sorted out. It's a little confusing, this paper-work story. In
the maritime world there are certain rules concerning entering and
clearing ports. Our last port was Bombay. The Alang port
authorities didn't want to clear us to enter, but they took our
paperwork anyway. Now we need our paperwork back from the Alang
authorities as we are not being allowed to enter Mumbai without
it.&lt;/p&gt;

uneventful except for the activity of many local fishermen and a
minor collision caused by another ship's captain being asleep at
the helm. As the days passed things got a bit more serious: the
fresh food and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/warrior/archives/000962.html"&gt;water
ran out&lt;/a&gt;. A hot boat and no showers are an unpleasant
combination!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Land at last!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="hand painted banners welcoming greenpeace." title="The welcome for the Rainbow Warrior when it finally got permission to enter the port of Mumbai after 6 days of exclusion. The crew is now confined to the ship." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="55264"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Dec 6&lt;/span&gt;: I woke up early in the
morning to see the sunrise of my last day at sea. It was strange to
see Mumbai lying at our feet. It felt strange to see land again.
We've been at sea for three and a half weeks and we were excited to
enter the harbour. At the same time we all would miss the beauty
and tranquillity of being on the ocean. When we got closer to shore
a band was playing music and a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/warrior/archives/000991.html"&gt;crowd
of people welcomed us&lt;/a&gt; with flowers and banners saying "Welcome
Back". If felt good to see people caring about our work and
ourselves. But although we thought this would be the end of the
waiting, it was really just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the night we were given an order saying that we were not
to leave the ship. All non-Indian crew were forbidden to disembark.
We felt trapped and we still do. What a shame the authorities are
making life hard for us and not the environmental criminals we
expose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make our voice heard we made a banner saying "Greenpeace
Persecuted for Exposing Environmental Crime". The Rainbow Warrior
lies next to a bridge where lots of people are passing by, so the
banner explains who we are and why we're here. It also seems that
we're extremely interesting; whatever we do we have an enormous
audience. It feels strange to be watched all the time. At sea I
felt free even though we were surrounded by nothing but water. Now
we can see people whenever we are on deck, but we cannot go ashore
and actually meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily the people from our Indian office are able to visit us.
They have been arranging everything we need. Besides new supplies,
they have also invited a lot of journalists and friends to come by
and visit us. We talk about the situation we're in and about the
double standards of the Indian Government. I call it a double
standard because while India supported our proposal for global
regulation of the shipbreaking industry at a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item%5fid=354321"&gt;
recent international meeting&lt;/a&gt; they then work against us in their
own country. And we're here exactly for the same goal. We want
global laws that obligate ship owners to make their old ships
toxic-free before they send them for scrap so that the people and
environment of India do not have to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/warrior/archives/000994.html"&gt;written
a letter to send to four Ministers in India&lt;/a&gt;. They have the
power to change this order and let us disembark. In this letter we
are asking for the authorities to allow us to let some crew off the
ship to go home and the new crew to join. We have all sent e-mails
to our friends and families asking them to send these faxes. Our
offices around the world are helping by sending these faxes and
asking for meetings with the Indian embassies in their
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="School children visit the ship." title="Schoolchildren visit to Rainbow Warrior. Currently the crew is confined to the ship by port authorities." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="55267"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while we are not allowed to leave the ship, we continue on
with the daily work on board. We have organised for school children
to come to the ship and have tours and talks with the crew. Many
supporters and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/warrior/archives/000996.html"&gt;interested
people are visiting us&lt;/a&gt;. So even though we are not able to go
ashore we are still able to help raise awareness here in Mumbai
about the importance of protecting the environment. It has been
inspiring that even though the authorities are preventing us from
going ashore the people of Mumbai have welcomed us and shown that
despite the government's reluctance they support our work towards a
clean and peaceful planet for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

	The cryosphere is that part of the Earth made of frozen water and soil: Iceworld, if you will. And according to a new study to be published in January, it's a world that is vanishing rapidly, with potentially devastating consequences.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world in which 17 million people are fleeing sea-rise
in Bangladesh. A world in which villages that rely on glacial melt
for their water supplies become ghost towns as the last of the ice
disappears. A world in which polar bears are extinct in the wild. A
world in which entire seaside economies and livelihoods are wiped
out by a rise in sea level that is measured in meters. Now imagine
that aspects of this world could be upon us within the lifetimes of
children being born today -- and in some scenarios, in our own
lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a chilling vision of a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mass Balance of the Cryosphere" (Cambridge University Press)
has been written by a team of 23 scientists and edited by Dr
Jonathan Bamber and Dr Anthony Payne of Bristol University. It
focuses on two key components of this sensitive environment: land
ice, in the form of ice sheets, caps and glaciers, and sea ice.
These are important indicators of both short and long-term climate
change. The book warns that the cryosphere is far more sensitive to
climate change than has been generally accepted, and that we ignore
at our peril the dramatic and disturbing trends that have already
been observed globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the findings in the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greenland ice sheet - the biggest ice mass in the Northern
Hemisphere - is melting around its margins. Some climate models
predict it could lose half its mass in the next 500-1000 years,
contributing 3 m to global sea level rise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The amount of Arctic summer sea ice has reduced dramatically in
the past 20 years and could disappear completely within an
estimated 100 years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Globally mountain and alpine glaciers everywhere are melting,
except for a few glaciers in Europe that are not retreating. The
rate of retreat is expected to accelerate over the next
century.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Antarctica - the largest ice mass in the world - presents a
more complex picture, although parts of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet and Peninsula ice shelves are in decline.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Evidence indicates that some of the changes being seen in the
cryosphere are related to the underlying man-made component of
global warming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Who needs ice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Polar bears, already under stress from climate change, could become extinct" title="Polar bears, already under stress from climate change, could become extinct" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="42169"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
implications of the decline of the cryosphere are far reaching and
go beyond merely losing snow and ice. Increased fresh water
influxes from the Arctic could trigger a slow down or diversion of
currents of the North Atlantic. What's commonly known as the Gulf
Stream is a part of a "conveyor belt" which brings warm water from
the Gulf of Mexico to the shores of Europe, circles up to the
Arctic, then plunges back into the deep ocean for another cycle.
Without its warming effect, North Western Europe would have a
climate similar to Greenland. Changes to the North Atlantic
currents could impact other sea currents and temperatures around
the globe, setting off chain-reaction climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As icesheets retreat, snow which once reflected sunlight and
heat back into the atmosphere gives way to earth and rock which
absorb its heat. As a result, we may well see accelerated warming
in the Arctic, and with it accelerated melt. As the ice disappears,
habitats for Arctic animals such as polar bears, seals and other
large predators are lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much of the cryosphere is lost, global sea
level rise could be measurable in metres. A sea level rise of only
1.5m would displace up to 17 million people in Bangladesh
alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond the icesheets, glacial retreats in many parts of the
world will mean reduced water for human consumption, agriculture
and hydro-electricity, shifting economic and social patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sea Ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="42028"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;There
are warning signs that during the latter half of the 20th Century
the Arctic has undergone substantial climate change. One of the key
indicators is sea ice extent and thickness, both of which have
shown a measurable and disturbing decrease during the last half of
the century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If summer rates of ice decrease continue or accelerate there
could, potentially, be no summer sea ice in the Arctic within 100
years or less. This will have major impacts on energy and moisture
exchange and consequently on the climate of the Northern
Hemisphere, including the risk of altering or slowing down the Gulf
Stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of such dramatic changes in sea ice cover are
the subject of a number of climate modelling studies and it is,
currently, too early to say precisely what the implications of
these changes might be. However such changes are likely to include
impacts on wildlife and indigenous populations, as well as
increasing the positive feedback of higher temperatures as the ice
disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is general agreement that acceleration in melting globally
will take place over the next century if greenhouse gas emissions
continue to accelerate at the rate they have done for the past 50
to 100 years. Extrapolation of the present trend suggests a
reduction in area of the Arctic sea ice of 4.7 million square km by
2100, i.e. virtually complete elimination of the Arctic ice pack in
summer. If the predictions of warming in the Arctic over the same
time period are taken into account, the rate of melting could be
considerably faster as the Arctic is particularly sensitive to
temperature increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lower elevations in Greenland, ice sheet loss is
conservatively estimated to be 50 cubic km/year, which is
equivalent to 0.13 mm/year of sea level rise. As most ice sheet
data has been collected only over the past few decades or less, it
is difficult to know how long this negative imbalance has existed
but it has certainly been enhanced by the warming during the 1990s,
and the record melt extent observed in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thinning rates cannot be explained by increased surface
melting alone, so the implication is that something else is causing
this. Extensive thinning in several separate areas suggests that
this may be climatically induced, for example, by increased surface
melt water reaching the bedrock on which the ice sits, causing the
ice to slide on its bed. If true, this is of profound significance
as it suggests that the dynamic response time of the ice sheet is,
potentially, much shorter than previously believed. Such a rapid
dynamic response to changing climate has not, to date, been
satisfactorily incorporated in modelling studies, nor have the
complex interactions between ice, the oceans, and the atmosphere.
All of which means that ice loss could in fact be much faster and
greater than currently predicted. This could mean that some of the
impacts previously predicted to occur hundreds of years in the
future could happen much faster, perhaps within a century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Antarctic Ice Sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Crack in the Larsen B ice shelf" title="Crack in the Larsen B ice shelf" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="42556"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;While
the East Antarctic Ice Sheet appears to be close to balance; it is
a different story on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been a
significant warming on the peninsula of about 4 degrees Celsius in
the last 50 years, associated with a regional decline in sea ice.
While this is a strong signal, it's quite localised. Ice shelves
along the Peninsula are only a few hundred metres thick and float
on the surface of the ocean and are quite sensitive to changes in
the ocean temperature and ocean circulation. Two major ice shelf
collapses have been observed over the last decade along the
Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Glaciers and ice caps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water stored in glaciers and icecaps around the world would
contribute 0.5m sea level rise if they all melted. This is small
compared to the 68.3m sea level rise that total melting of the
Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets would cause (6m and 62m,
respectively). However, glaciers respond much more rapidly than ice
sheets. Glacier and ice cap response times are typically below 100
years, which means that the bulk of the cryosphere's contribution
to human-induced sea-level rise over the coming century is likely
to come from these types of ice mass. There are more than 160,000
glaciers worldwide, making measurement of glacier mass balance very
difficult, but existing research indicates that glacial loss is
responsible for between 0.22mm to 0.25mm a year sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex analysis is needed to understand how glaciers react
once melting begins, and what a partial loss of glacier ice would
mean for its water flow system. The assessment of historical and
predicted future contributions to sea level from glaciers is still
in its infancy. Changes in ice amounts have clearly been large and
are likely to continue to be important over the coming century,
however many challenges still remain in their accurate
measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sea ice loss - one example of how this might affect the environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="41590"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;According
to the Third Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), a reduction in sea ice will reduce ice
edges, which are prime habitat for marine organisms. Habitat loss
for some species of seal, walrus, and polar bear results from ice
melt, and animals at the top of the food chain - with their
low-reproductive rates - are vulnerable to changes in the polar
marine food chains. Some animals may be threatened (e.g., walrus,
polar bear, and some species of seal), whereas others may flourish
(e.g., some species of fish and penguins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Andrew DeRocher of the University of Alberta,
who is a world authority on polar bears, if the sea ice habitat
continues to deteriorate at current rates, polar bears and their
prey, such as ringed and bearded seals, would be unlikely to retain
their current population sizes and distribution. At some point, if
the loss of sea ice became so severe that all the Arctic sea ice
was lost for a substantial part of the year, we may lose polar
bears as a wild species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole Arctic marine ecosystem is tied to the presence and
dynamics of the sea ice. The main productivity bloom that occurs
each spring is exploited by both resident species and migrants,
which is tied to the melting of the annual sea ice. Some arctic
species travel halfway around the world to exploit the food sources
that flourish along the edge of the melting ice. Life along the
edge of the melting sea ice is the basis of Arctic marine
ecosystems. Removing this dynamic would have profound consequences
for all marine life. If the sea ice is drastically reduced or the
timing changed, we can expect the loss of many species that are
reliant upon this special habitat. It is likely that we will see
species expand from southern latitudes to occupy some of these
environments but it is impossible to say which ones. It is hard to
understand the dynamics of Arctic ecosystems and even harder to
predict with any certainty what may happen if the climate changes
substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What causes climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Floods in Czechia" title="Floods in Czechia" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="43348"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Climate
change is directly linked to our fossil energy consumption. Global
warming of the earth is the result of increasing greenhouse gas
emissions. The principal cause is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is
released when fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas are
burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 the IPCC issued its Third Assessment Report, which found
new and stronger evidence that most of the observed warming of the
past 50 years is attributable to human activities. It found that
about three-quarters of the anthropogenic (human created) emissions
of CO2 during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC also reported that the average global temperature was
projected to rise between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius in the next
100 years. This is a large increase over projections in the Second
Assessment Report (1995), which estimated the increase in
temperature to be between 1 and 3.5 degrees. In addition,
predictions suggest that this warming will be larger in the polar
regions, exacerbating the worrying trends already observed. A
2-degree increase would produce substantial damage to or loss of
many natural ecosystems, lead to spread of diseases such as malaria
and cause substantial damage to agriculture in developing
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific understanding of the Earth's climate and how humans
are affecting it is constantly improving, but there is still much
to learn about what climate change will mean to natural systems
such as the cryosphere. For most people polar regions are remote
places that are out of sight and perhaps out of mind. They are,
however, highly sensitive to climate change with strong feedbacks
at play. Dramatic and disturbing trends have already been observed
in the Arctic, Greenland, the Antarctic Peninsula and in glaciers
globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk of sea level rise that could displace millions of people;
radical alterations of ocean currents that in turn affect regional
climate; loss of glaciers that provide water people need to live;
changes to the food chain and even possible dramatic and rapid
irreversible changes to the global climate - these are some of the
possible impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the one global mechanism to address
climate change. As the latest round of Kyoto talks get underway in
Milan in December 2003, evidence about the serious impact of
climate change is mounting. Governments and industry must take
action to protect the climate now and stop trying to weaken the
Protocol. It is not only the cryosphere at risk, but also
potentially the global climate system.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Toxic tea party</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-china-toxic-pollution-230707/</url><text>
	Welcome to the Guiyu tea ceremony. Boss Guo sets a pair of thimble sized tea cups on a ceremonial tray. He half fills one of the tiny cups with bottled, drinkable water. In to the other he pours water from the well in his backyard. Then he fills both up with steaming Chinese tea. The cup with bottled water turns a healthy amber. The one with the well water instantly converts to an impenetrable black. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Tea made with imported water and a dark, murky tea made with polluted local water. The local water makes the tea turn black, probably due to the horrific groundwater pollution from Guiyu's e-waste yards. " src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/toxic-tea-e-waste.jpg" alt="Tea made with imported water and a dark, murky tea made with polluted local water. The local water makes the tea turn black, probably due to the horrific groundwater pollution from Guiyu's e-waste yards." width="250" height="375"&gt;Guo, a brash young man dressed in a purple polyester suit and white shirt, doesn't know why. He says he sees no connection between the stacks of dismembered electrical equipment behind us in his workshop and the strange quality of his water. Still he won't drink the black tea. "We won't even shower with that water," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guiyu, near China's southeastern coast is the centre of an uncontrolled environmental disaster. Here and in several nearby townships, electronic waste, most of it imported, is broken up in small workshops. It's a version of outsourcing that saves wealthier countries the high cost of disposing of their electronic trash. In this part of China recycling e-waste is apparently free of any environmental or health and safety regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filthy to apocalyptic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a landscape that varies from filthy to apocalyptic. In small workshops and yards and in the open countryside workers dismember the detritus of modernisation. Armed mostly with small hand tools they take apart old computers, monitors, printers, video and DVD players, photocopying machines, telephones and phone chargers, music speakers, car batteries and microwave ovens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scrap sites here are a profusion of technology brand names; HP, Dell, Compaq, IBM, Apple, Sun, NEC, LG and Motorola are just some of the names we found in the piles of tech junk. They are made in the US, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Mexico, Austria, Germany and UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese law forbids the importation of electronic waste and Beijing is also a signatory to the Basel Convention, an international treaty banning the shipment of e-waste from the developed to the developing world. But so far official prohibitions have been about as effective as the official banners urging environmental protection that flap in the breeze above the trash congested streets of Guiyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rash of similar waste sites has broken out further up the coast. Enforcement is difficult because China's economic boom is the driving force behind price hikes on the world's metals markets. Raging domestic demand has China sucking in metals in any form it can. In such a market the demand for scrap metals, including electronic waste is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="copyright"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And there's an important push factor; the high cost of disposing and recycling of electronic waste in developed countries. The cost of landfill is increasing and several European countries and some US states have banned outright the disposal of e-waste in landfills or by incineration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some in China are fighting back against the avalanche of imported junk. An increasingly vocal environmental lobby inside and outside government is helping push through new legislation in an effort to stem the tide of imports, as well as the increasing swell of domestically produced electronic waste. They will also seek to reduce the number of toxins used in manufacturing electronic equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Chineseman smelts computer parts in the open air to extract metals. Open air burning of computer waste releases large amounts of toxic fumes.

Open air burning of computer waste releases large amounts of toxic fumes. (© Greenpeace/Lai Yun)" width="600" height="449"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unaware of these issues, workers in Guiyu painstakingly reduce every piece of equipment to its smallest components. These are then farmed off to 'specialists', workers dedicated to stripping wires for the copper they contain or melting the lead solder from circuit boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others place circuit boards in open acid baths to separate precious metals including the tiny quantities of gold and palladium they contain. Plastics are graded by quality and other parts are burned to separate plastic from scrap metal. After this thorough dismembering any remaining combustibles are left to burn in open fires leaving an acrid stench of plastic, rubber and paint in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px;" title="A heavily polluted stream in Guiyu. Along side domestic rubbish the water is badly polluted with toxic waste from the e-waste recycling yards in the town. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)" src="/international/PageFiles/25502/polluted-water.jpg" alt="A heavily polluted stream in Guiyu. Along side domestic rubbish the water is badly polluted with toxic waste from the e-waste recycling yards in the town. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental cost is real. Streams are black and pungent and choked with industrial waste. Kevin Brigden, from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories, tested streams in the Guiyu area and found acid baths leaching into them. The streams had a Ph of a strong acid. That's powerful enough to disintegrate a penny after a few hours, says Brigden. (&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25502/recyclingelectronicwasteindiachinafull.pdf"&gt;Download the full scientific report on pollution in Guiyu&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also an economic cost. In Guiyu the price of water is ten times more than in Chendian, the neighbouring township that is today the main source of Guiyu's water. "We used to draw our water from the lake,"says an elderly man, jerking his head in the direction of the putrid cesspit we had driven past a few minutes before. "But that was nearly 20 years ago," he says. On the baking street in front of him a huge orange plastic tank perched on the back of a three wheeled agriculture vehicle dispenses water to Guiyu residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The digital divide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two decades incomes have risen sharply even as the quality of the environment has plunged. The locals, who were initially driven to garbage recycling by their poverty, have become middle class. Unburdened by the costs of safe recycling, the economics behind e-waste disposal in Guiyu can mean a profitable living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the locals have moved out of their traditional single storey homes into newly built three and four storey buildings where the ground floor is reserved as a scrap-sorting workshop. Now they employ migrant workers to risk their health in this toxic business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title='Youngworkers "bake" computer motherboards from e-waste in a workshop toremove valuable metals. The baking produces highly dangerous fumes andtoxic waste which is then dumped. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)' src="/international/PageFiles/25502/e-waste-cooking-heavy-metals.jpg" alt='Youngworkers "bake" computer motherboards from e-waste in a workshop toremove valuable metals. The baking produces highly dangerous fumes andtoxic waste which is then dumped. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)' width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the migrants, this is as close as they'll come to bridging the digital divide. Xiao Li has never sat at a computer, logged on to the internet, used a printer or a photocopier but he has spent the last six years processing high tech equipment from around the world. He makes around US$5 per day melting lead solder off circuit boards and says that life is better here than in his remote farming village in the mountains of Sichuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this a better life? Most of these peasants turned workers say it is, albeit by a small margin. "It's a bit better than home," says one weary middle aged woman from Henan's Shangqiu county who works out of a rough shack inside a scrap yard, "there it's too poor, we barely had enough to eat." She makes between 200 and 300 yuan (US$ 24 - US$ 36) per month in Guiyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiao Li, who has been here longer and makes more money, has a TV and a mobile phone and shares a room in one of the old village houses rented out by the local owners who have moved into a four storey house in the township. He doesn't mind the pollution. "We are used to it," says the cheery 22 year old, "and there is no impact on my health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lead poisoning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is probably wrong. Only limited investigations have been carried out on the health effects of Guiyu's poisoned environment, but those that have paint an alarming picture. One of them was carried out by Professor Huo Xia &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1913570/"&gt;(full study)&lt;/a&gt;, of the Shantou University Medical College, an hour and a half's drive from Guiyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tested 165 children for concentrations of lead in their blood. Eighty-two percent of the Guiyu children had blood/lead levels of more than 100. Anything above that figure is considered unsafe by international health experts. The average reading for the group was 149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High levels of lead in young children's blood can impact IQ and the development of the central nervous system. The highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate report by the Shantou Medical University Hospital in November 2003 found a high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, chronic gastritis, and gastric and duodenal ulcers, especially among migrants who recycle circuit boards and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent study has revealed e-waste labourers in China have very high concentrations of toxic flame retardants in their bodies. One worker had by far the highest concentration ever reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local doctor told us there was also a higher than normal incidence of miscarriages and handicapped babies among those who worked with e-waste. Much of this kind of information remains anecdotal because the hospitals have not been authorised to fully investigate the incidence of waste related illness among their patients he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veil of silence means that nobody is held to account for the environmental and human impact of globalisation in Guiyu. There are plenty of people who should be held accountable and some who should not: "Lots of people are responsible, says Dr. Huo, "the bosses who run these businesses, the companies who ship the material and many others, she says, "but certainly not the workers. They are poor peasants and don't understand the damage this does to them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px;" title="Workers unpack a truck-load of e-waste which has just arrived for processing in Guiyu in Guangzhou province. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)" src="/international/PageFiles/25502/toxic-e-waste-truck.jpg" alt="Workers unpack a truck-load of e-waste which has just arrived for processing in Guiyu in Guangzhou province. (© Greenpeace/Natalie Behring)" width="600" height="397"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the junk keeps coming to Guiyu. Imports of e-waste have been illegal in China since 1996 so there are no official figures on how much is coming into the country. Environmental activists and academics in Guangdong estimate that Guiyu alone handles over a million tonnes of e-waste annually. Whatever the figure it is obvious to any visitor that the trade goes on unhindered; scrap yards are piled high with imported waste and trucks can be seen unloading new cargo daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stemming the toxic tide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guiyu is one of the most graphic examples of digital dumps but similar places can be found across Asia and in certain locations in Africa. With amounts of e-waste growing rapidly each year urgent solutions are required. While the waste continues to flow into digital dumps like Guiyu there are measures that can help stem the toxic tide of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major electronics firms should remove the worst chemicals to make their products safer and easier to recycle. All companies must take full responsibility for their products and, once they reach the end of their useful life, take their goods back for re-use, safe recycling or disposal.

	Our work in the Amazon continues after a successful campaign to expose gross illegalities in Brazil's mahogany trade.  In November 2002, we achieved an historic victory when governments of the world agreed to give the highly vulnerable and sought-after tree greater international protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.  But corruption, the silencing of dissent, forced labor, and murder are still commonplace within the Amazon basin's remote forest products business.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            MV Esperanza.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the United States, Greenpeace, Inc., is being
criminally prosecuted by the Bush administration. In an
unprecedented prosecution, the entire organization has been charged
under an archaic law for a protest in which Greenpeace activists
boarded a ship that was bound for the Port of Miami with a cargo of
illegally logged mahogany. The activists carried a banner reading,
"President Bush: Stop Illegal Logging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MV Esperanza is also in the US, fresh from a tour of the
Tongass National Forest in Alaska where Greenpeace activists were
documenting the clearcuts and damage done by poor logging
practices. The ship also supported a cave expedition, which mapped
and explored caves under the forest. Logging above is limited by
regulation to protect the caves below, but many of these caves
aren't officially "on the map", so loggers and federal officials
conveniently ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Alaska tour, it's only natural for the MV Esperanza to
visit Miami. Greenpeace has a lot of supporters there, and it's
where the trial is taking place. At first there were no problems,
just a routine request for dock space. Then, suddenly, the
authorities informed Greenpeace that the Esperanza would not be
allowed into port. They cited the outstanding court case that the
Bush administration is pursuing, and claimed a "security risk".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute. Greenpeace hasn't even been convicted yet.
What happened to innocent until proven guilty? And no doubt ships
belonging to corporations with criminal records dock in Miami all
of the time. What about companies transporting illegal mahogany,
for example? That's apparently OK with the authorities. But
boarding a ship to blow the whistle on those companies - that the
Port of Miami doesn't like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a question for the Miami port authorities: Which is more
dangerous, a chemical (or oil) tanker owned by a company with a
poor criminal/safety record? Or a ship owned by an organization
with a 31-year reputation for taking peaceful action to highlight
environmental issues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the official response to our arrival, Greenpeace
and our environmental message appear to pose a grave threat. The
following account is from one of our folks in Miami:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Even before the Esperanza had dropped
anchor, the following were on scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;A US Coast Guard vessel with approx 20 officials on board,
Customs and Immigration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;One US Coast Guard Jet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;One marine Safety helicopter which stayed on the scene
circling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two TV helicopters documenting the situation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our charter vessel with photo/video&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tug carrying the agent and Captain Bob Graham&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two law enforcement vessels (armed) from Fish and
Wildlife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;And a poor guy who was quietly trying to fish......&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The US Coast Guard personnel ( all of them) boarded the ship.
Crew were told to all muster on the heli deck and later they were
all detained in the Bridge while paperwork and inspections carried
out.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The charter boat we were on was then
detained by Fish and Wildlife. They made a safety inspection and
took all our identification to process through computers. During
this time, the Marine Safety heli took videos of us all. The
captain was given a citation for not having the name of the boat
displayed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;We have been denied permission to
carry press or visitors in our inflatables to and from shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The Port of Miami and Mayor's office
is being inundated by calls from people objecting to the decision
to refuse us entry. So much so, they are NOT taking calls and only
faxes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has agreed to compromise on any security measures the
port requires, but continues to be stonewalled. Now we are taking
our case to the county authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a move unprecedented in its history, the US government has indicted an entire organization - Greenpeace USA, Inc. (the Greenpeace entity in the US) - for the peaceful protest activities of its supporters.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace opposes illegal mahogany shipments into the US.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The protest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, several miles off the coast of Florida, two
Greenpeace activists boarded the Jade - a ship carrying wood
illegally exported from the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists made it clear by their appearance, words and
actions that they were engaged in a peaceful effort. The fact that
the activists had "Greenpeace" on their boats and clothing helped
to reassure the crew of the Jade that the people coming on board
were peaceful and safety conscious. When they boarded the ship,
using a ladder hanging from its side, they brought with them a
banner reading, "President Bush: Stop Illegal Logging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading3special"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pannelbody"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/bin/view.pl/10048/action_id/195.html"&gt;Tell the US Government to prosecute illegal loggers, not Greenpeace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;US Government response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of intercepting the contraband and prosecuting the
smugglers, the US government is going after Greenpeace. Making this
the first time in history that the US government has prosecuted an
entire organization for free speech related activities, and they
are trying to do it without a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;In context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists off the coast of Miami were continuing a long US
tradition of protest and civil disobedience. This tradition
stretches back to include the civil rights movement, women's
suffrage and the Boston Tea Party. Plus, they were essentially
acting as whistle-blowers - publicly exposing, and trying to
prevent, the importation of illegally harvested mahogany wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their action was a small, but important, contribution to a
global effort - which helped prompt an agreement, at an
international conference that November, to give mahogany greater
global protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its work on this issue, Greenpeace received praise from the
European Union, and the government of Brazil... And now a landmark
indictment from the US government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Charges and what's at stake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- One violation of U.S.C. section 2279, which prohibits persons,
"not being duly authorized by law for the purpose," from "[going]
on board any vessel about to arrive at the place of her
destination, before her actual arrival, and before she has been
completely moored".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- And one count of conspiracy, under 18 U.S.C. section 371, to
commit this offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential fine, of $10,000 USD per charge, is serious money
for an organization that doesn't accept corporate or government
donations. The organization could also receive up to five years of
probation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing government monitoring, if sentenced to probation, would
make Greenpeace's role as a watchdog and advocacy group difficult,
to say the least. But it is the legal precedent that could be most
damaging for Greenpeace and other advocacy groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial part of what Greenpeace does is the exercise of its
right to free speech in calling attention to environmental
problems. A tactic this protest exemplifies: In an effort to help
save the Amazon, activists engaged in a very public direct
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a conviction in this case could have a chilling
effect on the ability of Greenpeace, and other groups, to
effectively criticize powerful corporate and government targets on
social and environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled to take place this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

want loggers to play by the rules. But Brazilian mahogany barons,
local lumber lords, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Port of
Miami all want these tree-huggers stopped"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Times: &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1011-03.htm"&gt;Typical
Greenpeace Protest Leads to Unusual Prosecution:&lt;/a&gt; "It was a
routine act of civil disobedience until, 15 months after the
incident, federal prosecutors in Miami indicted Greenpeace itself
for authorizing the boarding. The group says the indictment
represents a turning point in the history of American dissent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The extraordinary effort made to find and use this obscure law
strongly suggests a campaign of selective prosecution - the
greatest scourge of the First Amendment."&lt;/p&gt;

	Michelle Benjamin is a publisher at Raincoast books - a book publishing and distribution company on the West coast of Canada.  They publish in a range of genres, both fiction and non-fiction - but most famously the Canadian editions of the Harry Potter books.She's in Europe for the Frankfurt book fair (the largest in the world).  On the way, she stopped by the Greenpeace office here in Amsterdam, and took time to answer some of our questions about publishing and the environment...

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Michelle Benjamin, a publisher at Raincoast books.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;First, what tangible benefits have there been from printing the Canadian edition of Harry Potter on recycled paper?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printing the Harry Potter book in Canada, we printed it on 100%
post consumer recycled paper, and there've been a number of
achievements at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, in our company, it's brought a lot of enthusiasm to
people's jobs. People are very excited to be part of a project, a
book and a campaign that makes them feel good about their work and
what they're doing - and makes them feel like they're contributing
to a larger global initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the public and public awareness, because we printed
just over a million copies of this book in Canada it means that
over a million children, and adults, are reading this book and
seeing the statement by J.K. Rowling inside the front cover about
protecting the world's forests and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the environment, it means we've been able to not
destroy approximately 40,000 trees - and also see a number of other
environmental savings in terms of water usage and creation of
waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also contributed to a larger initiative in Canada, across all
of the publishers, to eliminate the use of ancient forest paper
from our production process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Have there been any challenges or obstacles to using recycled paper?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there've been many challenges. There are still challenges.
The three main challenges that we've identified and had to work
with are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of the paper. When we started this initiative
three years ago there were no book quality recycled papers, ancient
forest friendly papers, available. So we had to work with paper
mills to create and develop those papers, and work with our
printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality was another issue. The first papers that came out of the
mills were inconsistent in their quality, and they just didn't look
and feel the way quality book papers need to look and feel. A few
years ago, recycled paper tended to be quite grey, and dirty and
you'd have flecks. But that isn't the case any more. You can get
really, really fine, high quality recycled papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And price was a significant obstacle. It remains an obstacle.
These papers, because it's a new process, because they're producing
them in smaller quantities then regular papers, their prices just
aren't as competitive as the more traditional stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is, as the campaign continues and demand increases -
not just in Canada but across the world - that prices will become
more competitive. And we've already seen that happen in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Your company uses printers, who do the paper sourcing.  So, going back three years to before you began this initiative, you didn't really know where the paper pulp was sourced.  When you found out, did it come as something of a surprise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it did. And I think that's true for some of the other
publishers in Canada as well. I think publishers generally are a
very socially aware community and environmentally aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we just hadn't given enough thought to that part of the
process. There certainly were surprises. Surprising to realize that
almost all of the papers we were using were from 100 percent virgin
stock from not certified, not FSC, not sustainable sources. So that
was surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we have started looking at the supply chain for
materials, not just for our book production but across all our
business practices, it's been quite a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;What can regular consumers do to support book publishers who are using ancient forest friendly paper?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things. One, they can be aware that these
campaigns are happening, and look for the information printed on
the books that says whether it's printed from a recycled stock or a
FSC certified stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when they do see that they can, certainly buy the books, but
they can also let the publishers and the booksellers know that they
are doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most publishers have a website, with email access. It makes a
big difference when we hear from the general public that they have
seen those notices, and that it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

	Iceland enjoys a rugged, natural beauty that can only be appreciated fully by seeing it. It also hosts a people who are fiercely proud of their largely pristine and clean environment. So why, after 14 years, has the Icelandic government bowed to internal pressure and begun whaling again?  Has nothing changed since long-haired Greenpeace hippies took to the high seas in the late 70s?  Rémi Parmentier takes us on Part II of a three-part journey back in time.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/9/crew-of-1978-greenpeace-voyage.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rémi Parmentier, lower left, in 1978 aboard the Rainbow Warrior
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are at war (even a non-violent "war" against the
whaling industry), you don't win every battle, or every aspect of
it. We certainly won the overall whaling war in the 70s, even if
today Iceland and Japan are still using a "scientific whaling"
loophole to hunt Minke whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is regrettable, however, is that - on the way - we
sacrificed our relationship with the Icelanders. Even if I can say
today that we have nothing to be ashamed of -- far from it -- I can
also say that we could have been smarter. We were just learning the
tricks of a new form of campaigning as we were inventing them, and
despite our mistakes we made a lasting mark on the history of
whaling, and accelerated its progressive elimination. It is just
too bad that Greenpeace lost a potentially strong ally - the
Icelandic people -- in the "war" against whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit Iceland, you will discover a land with a sky that
is clearer than in any other European country, and with people who
have adapted wisely to a harsh environment. They have harassed
geothermal energy, put hydrogen cars on the street, and, unlike the
US and Russia, ratified the Kyoto Protocol. They value the
preservation of their environment, no less than other modern
nations, and have done more to defend that environment than
most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Greenpeace campaigns against Iceland's whaling unified her
people in a view of Greenpeace as an enemy, an anti-Icelandic
force. We saw world opinion as our best weapon against whaling, and
played to that, ignoring the need to respect and work with the
people of Iceland themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;It is all about perceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did we really "sacrifice" our relationship with Iceland? To
talk to people in the streets of Reykjavik, or anyone who followed
the whaling conflicts over the past decades, you'd expect
Greenpeace and Iceland to be sworn enemies, dueling with bared
teeth at any opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A crewmember paints the Rainbow Warrior, 1978" title="A crewmember paints the Rainbow Warrior, 1978" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53308"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
that's not the picture if you scratch below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as the 70s, we were pointing toward an economic
opportunity that has since yielded rich rewards. On first visiting
Iceland we proposed that the whaling industry could be replaced by
a whale-watching industry for tourists. Living whales can bring as
much money, or more, and for longer, than dead whales, we said in a
genuine attempt to change the mind-set. Like all visionary and
ground-breaking thoughts, it was a laughable one at the time, and
we were treated like weirdos: the weather in Iceland was not suited
to taking tourists out to sea, they said; this was not the Canary
Islands or the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was pleasantly surprised the last time that I visited
Reykjavik, in 1998, to see that there was a flourishing whale
watching industry in the country. On hotel reception shelves, the
old post cards of the Hvalur whaling station were replaced by post
cards showing whale watchers taking pictures of living whales
blowing on the surface of the sea. Whereas in the 1970s, tour
operators would take visitors to the whaling station to photograph
themselves and their children beside dead whales, they were now
taking them to photograph themselves with living whales. Ideas
which are ahead of their time will always be laughed at. But I'm
proud that the last laugh was on the nay-sayers, and that the
Icelandic whale watching industry turned out to be a benefit to
Icelanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Beyond whaling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have returned to Iceland several times in the course of these
twenty five years, mostly in connection with work I was doing with
Greenpeace to improve international environmental policy and law to
prevent marine pollution. That's an issue which Iceland is aware of
and active on, as you would expect an island country entirely
surrounded by ocean and heavily dependent on fish exports to
be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Crewmembers of the 1978 Greenpeace voyage to Iceland" title="Crewmembers of the 1978 Greenpeace voyage to Iceland" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53311"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Since
the early 1990s, whenever I had the time to pass by the harbour
during a Reykjavik visit, I would always go and see the four
decommissioned whale catchers of Hvalur hf. The sight of these four
superb steamers brings back a lot of memories each time of course,
but also the thought that they would be perfect whale-watching
boats, for logistical as well as symbolic reasons. Although the
four catchers have been inactive for many years, the whaling
company Hvalur hf keeps them well fitted and maintained as if they
were ready to go whale hunting at any minute. I remember asking
Arni Finnsson, a veteran Icelandic conservationist, why that
was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could they be expecting the hunting season to be re-authorised?
"Well, no," said Arni, "they are just making a statement in this
way". If this is the best way for the whaling company to save face,
so be it, but these guys always remained pretty active for a
company that had not harpooned a single whale for many years, and I
bet they are watching closely what is happening up north with the
limited resumption of Minke whaling that the government has just
authorised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, although I would tend to agree that the catch of
a few Minke whales is not the most pressing environmental
challenge, I think Greenpeace has been right to react to it this
summer, because it is a test case, for whalers and conservationists
alike. I remember that during my last visit to Iceland, in the
spring of 1998 to participate in a technical meeting of the OSPAR
Commission, the intergovernmental body that regulates marine
pollution in the North East Atlantic, the Board of Directors of
Hvalur hf was meeting - purely by coincidence - in the same hotel
and on the same floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even bumped in to Mr. Kristian Loftson, the Head of Hvalur hf,
along with some of his associates, in the elevator. It was clear
from their body language that these guys were not getting together
to talk about the weather or share photos of their
grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any opportunity, they'll be out there again harpooning large
Fin and Sei whales. I'm certain they'd even harpoon blue whales if
they were allowed, and it's precisely that kind of pressure on the
Icelandic government which makes any return to whaling dangerous.
The history of the industry is one in which more and more whales
are hunted until the target species is depleted, and if the whalers
can get over the initial public opposition to their Minke hunt, it
won't be long before higher quotas and additional species begin to
creep in to the industry's demands to the government. This is one
industry whose record of self-management is provenly appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the years that I've worked with Iceland in the
diplomatic hallways and side rooms of international treaty
negotiations, I came to appreciate what a minority Mr. Loftson and
his kind are in Icelandic politics, and how their single-minded
approach to resource exploitation is fundamentally at odds with the
principles which inform Iceland's environmental policies
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many Icelanders would believe that their nation and
Greenpeace worked side by side for many years, quietly behind
closed doors, far away from the television cameras and journalistic
buzz that accompanied our confrontations on the high seas. But it's
a fact, and a story which is overdue in telling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Iceland has begun whaling again after 14 years.  Surely such a retrograde decision must mean Iceland is a rogue state when it comes to the environment, a home of barbaric rapers of the Earth?  Not so, says Rémi Parmentier in the concluding chapter of a three-part journey back in time. From his voyage with Greenpeace in 1978 through his experience in the 90s of working with Iceland in international fora, Parmentier brings his unique perspective to bear on Iceland, the environment, and whales.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long after my long-haired hippy voyage to Iceland as an
anti-whaling crusader, I had the privilege of working with
representatives of Iceland at a number of international fora, and
often their contributions to environmental protection was
remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s for example, Greenpeace was campaigning for the
elimination of persistent organic pollutants, a large group of
toxic substances that concentrate in cold sea-water environments,
contaminating fish, marine mammals and other species (including
humans). A major international environmental treaty known as the &lt;a href="http://www.pops.int/"&gt;POPs Convention&lt;/a&gt;, adopted in 2001 in
Stockholm, finds its origin in a speech that was prepared by two
Icelandic officials, Dr. David Egilsson and Magnus Johanneson, at a
meeting of the Governing Council of the UN Environment Programme
(UNEP) that I attended in 1995 in Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, it can be said that it was thanks to Iceland acting in
coalition with Ireland, Denmark and Norway, that in June 2000 it
was decided that the continued discharge and emission of
radioactive wastes from the nuclear reprocessing plants at
Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France) were inconsistent with the
international treaty that regulates marine pollution in the North
East Atlantic, known as the &lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/"&gt;OSPAR
Convention&lt;/a&gt;. There is mounting evidence of high concentrations
of radioactive Technitium-99 and other radionuclides discharged at
Sellafield and La Hague in seaweeds, shrimps and other marine life,
which corroborates Greenpeace concerns expressed since the 1970s.
This pollution moved up along the coasts of Denmark, Norway and up
towards Iceland; thanks to the determination of these three
countries(and notwithstanding fierce opposition by France and the
UK), the OSPAR Commission adopted a legally-binding Decision
calling for dry-storage of radioactive fuel, the &lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/zip/SZ20030910-113936-5179/document.zip"&gt;
non-reprocessing option.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, France and the UK, who did not vote in favour, have
continued to discharge reprocessing radioactive wastes, but the
OSPAR Decision sponsored by Iceland and others was nevertheless
important. Thanks to that decision, France and the UK have lost
their number one argument: they can no longer say that discharging
these radioactive wastes is in line with international
environmental law and policy, and countries such as Iceland who
oppose these discharges have gained the moral high ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland was also traditionally a strong voice at the UN's
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) pushing for the total
prohibition of radioactive and industrial waste dumping from ships
at sea (a goal that was promoted by Greenpeace for many years and
eventually &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25797/odhistory.pdf"&gt;
adopted in 1993 by the Parties to the London Convention on ocean
dumping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ban on ocean dumping is very effective; to the best of our
knowledge, since 1993 no ship has been sent out to deliberately
dump radioactive wastes at sea. Even the Russian Federation, which
keeps moaning that it would rather start dumping at sea again, have
had to abide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland also supported the Greenpeace view openly at meetings of
the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) when we demanded
that the countries shipping high-level radioactive wastes,
irradiated nuclear fuel and plutonium by sea be held liable and
forced to inform neighbouring coastal states in advance. Last but
not least, when in 1995 Greenpeace occupied the controversial Brent
Spar decommissioned offshore installation to prevent it from being
dumped in the Atlantic, Iceland was one of the countries which
understood Greenpeace's message: if Shell and the UK were let off
the hook with this first dump, perhaps hundreds more would follow
(thereby raising safety problems for trawlers, potential sources of
pollution and the broader issue of industrial responsibility).
Iceland supported a call for a moratorium on the dumping of
offshore installations, which led three years later to a unanimous
&lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/measures/decisions/od98-03e.doc"&gt;Decision&lt;/a&gt;
by coastal states to prohibit permanently the dumping of
decommissioned offshore installations at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all large fishing countries, Iceland is facing a crisis and
many challenges of course. But when I used to represent Greenpeace
as observer at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), I was also
impressed to see the Icelanders actively campaigning for the
elimination of government subsidies to fishing fleets. Current
industrial fishing practices, particularly in the European Union,
have little to do with free and sustainable trade, because the
governments are using taxpayers' money to increase the efficiency
of fishing fleets or maintain them afloat artificially, with
devastating effects on the environment and the sustainability of
developing countries whose resources are being ravaged by the big
commercial fleets. Together with New Zealand, Iceland has led the
charge at the WTO since at least 1999 for the elimination of
fisheries subsidies, and this is a good thing, even if not
everything is perfect with these two countries' own fisheries
practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Towards an End to the Misunderstanding?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of Greenpeace includes a patchwork of missed
opportunities and misunderstandings with different communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the best interest of the industrial sectors we were
taking on to promote the image of Greenpeace as an organisation
that goes after a nation or a community rather than after a
specific unsustainable practice. And - truly -- this perception was
also sometimes exacerbated by our own mistakes and lack of
diplomatic or pedagogic skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Greenpeace's difficult relation with France from the
1970s to the mid 1990s when we were campaigning against nuclear
testing is probably the most extreme example. Yet, once the nuclear
testing campaign ended (i.e. when French nuclear testing ended and
a nuclear test ban treaty was adopted in Geneva) Greenpeace's and
France's mutual relations became more rational, to the extent that
President Jacques Chirac at a recent meeting with French NGO
representatives was heard saying, in relation to the issue of
illegal logging in West African forests, that he was "closer to the
position of Greenpeace than that of his own administration".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I held a meeting in Reykjavik with an Icelandic
Environment minister (it must have been in the spring of 1990, to
discuss marine pollution policy issues), I was asked to come to his
office in the evening after all the staff would be gone, so that
no-one could see us. Fortunately, this meeting served to break the
ice, because since then, I have never been asked to come at odd
hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday night in the winter of 1995, Clif Curtis - a
former Greenpeace political officer - and I were drinking beer in a
bar in downtown Reykjavik when a couple of young Icelandic women
sat at our table and asked us what we were doing in the country.
When I said that we were participating in a United Nations
conference on marine pollution hosted by the Icelandic government,
they thought it was great, but as soon as Clif told them that we
represented Greenpeace at that conference, the two women yelled at
us so much (It was not their first beer of the night)that we had to
leave quickly and find another bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I felt very sad when I realised what had happened
to these young Icelandic women: in 1978 when we first came to
Iceland with the Rainbow Warrior, they could not have been more
than 5 years old at most. And I could imagine them being children
and hearing many dinner conversations, many TV news shows, and many
classroom lectures, where people were talking about a group of
foreigners on a boat out there trying to deprive Iceland of their
whale resources. When a country has no enemy its leaders like to
create some to keep people together (ask George Bush). This was
what had happened to these two young women, and to Iceland at
large, with Greenpeace. For 25 years an entire generation has been
brought up in the belief that Greenpeace was a fierce enemy of
their nation. What a waste!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was writing this paper, I saw on the Internet that the
Rainbow Warrior has been greeted in Iceland by a group of kids
making a provocative whale meat barbecue alongside. There are
powerful forces gearing up now in Iceland to resume commercial
whaling. Some of those forces are interested in damaging the
relationship of Greenpeace with Iceland for another entire
generation. Watch out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;This is Part III of a three-part
series by Rémi Parmentier, a crew member on the first voyage of the
Rainbow Warrior, which took Greenpeace to Iceland to confront
commercial whaling there for the first time in 1978. Rémi has

Ivory, diamonds and gold have been taken and shipped to the centres of old empires and now finally, the forest itself is being torn down and sent on the same journey.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/stop-illegal-logging" class="act"&gt;TAKE ACTION:  Demand Mandatory Laws on Illegal
Timber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) declared a moratorium on new loggingconcessions in an attempt
to halt the widespread destruction. It didn'twork, in part due to
corruption and the continued flood of illegaltimber flowing into
consumer countries because there are still no lawsprohibiting their
importation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the trade in illegal timber does little to
reduce thepoverty in producer countries. The World Bank estimates
that illegallogging costs timber-producing countries between US$10
and15 billion ayear in lost revenue with this money only fuelling
the profit marginsof logging companies and their local allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legality of current logging to be examined&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the President of the DRC, Joseph Kabila signed a
decree thatupholds the 2002 moratorium, freezing new logging
concessions in up to40 million hectares of rainforest while the
legality of all currentlogging concessions are examined. Without
international assistance toremove corrupt and illegal logging
companies from the Congoleseforestry sector and laws prohibiting
the importation of illegal timberinto consumer countries however,
this decree might not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer countries of Europe, Japan and the US have been
slow tocreate the laws that would support the efforts of producer
countrieslike the DRC. As they wash their hands of any
responsibility as thepurchasers of the illegal timber, the last
ancient forests in Africaare wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Until now, the logging industry has been a law unto itself,
destroyingthe rainforest to supply wood to Europe, Asia and the
USA. This decreeis an important first step towards responsible and
socially just forestmanagement, but this will only be achieved in
this post-conflictcountry with assistance from the international
community," said FilipVerbelen, Greenpeace International forest
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Illegal timber flowing freely into consumer countries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id=" 49438" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last month, we have highlighted the ease at which illegal
anddestructively logged timber enters the consumer countries. In &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/action-on-illegal-logging-ital/"&gt;
Italy&lt;/a&gt; itwas illegal timber from Africa being unloaded in the
port of Livorno.&lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/museum-built-from-amazon-destr/"&gt;
Spain&lt;/a&gt; had illegal timber from the Amazon in its prized Queen
SofiaMuseum and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/importing-forest-destruction-222/"&gt;
UK&lt;/a&gt; was caught red-handed with plywood made from illegaltimber
from the Paradise forests of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again the answer to halting the destruction of the
lastancient forests has been clear. Laws prohibiting the
importation ofillegal and destructively logged timber into consumer
countries are thefirst step to stemming the tide of destruction in
the last of ourancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DRC is trying to halt the destruction and protect its
forests andthe people and wildlife that depend on them. It is time
for Europe,Japan and the US to follow the lead and enact laws to
help protect thelast ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action to stop illegal timber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/stop-illegal-logging"&gt;Louis Michel believes measures to stop the importation of illegal timber into Europe should be voluntary, let him know that it is mandatory!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us in our work to save the forests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_204"&gt;Become part of the solution and protect the last of our ancient forests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenfreeze: the ozone and climate-friendly solution for home refrigeration. Industry said it wouldn't work, was too costly, and would never find a market. Until we proved them wrong.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate in the European Parliament today was ostensibly
aboutregulating a class of chemicals, fluorinated greenhouse gases,
known asF-gases.  But it was really a battle between the interests
of amultimillion dollar industry and the future of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Parliament at the plenary session in Strasbourg
rejected a proposal to replace hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs (a
fluorinated gas 1,300 times stronger than carbon dioxide), in
household refrigerators, even though the EU market is already
dominated by the climate-friendly alternative
Greenfreezetechnology.  They rejected other strong measures
recommended bytheir own environment committee and instead approved
only the weakestprovisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;F-gas: the cure that's as bad as the
disease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-gases are used in many appliances such as refrigerators,
airconditioning, foam blowers and car tyres. They replaced
ozone-depletinggases such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), which are
being phased outglobally as part of the 1990 Montreal Protocol.
F-gases likehydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) are thus often portrayed by
theirmanufacturers as 'environmentally friendly'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, whilethey were introduced to address the problem of the
hole in the Earth'sprotective ozone layer -- discovered in 1985
--they were introducedbefore scientists became worried about
dangerous climate change, andwere subsequently discovered to be
highly potent &lt;a href="~/link/b3e54473a31649a7b6183fc0cbf23b22.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;
greenhouse gases.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most appliances, natural alternatives to F-gases are either
alreadyavailable and widely used, or are in development. For
example,Greenpeace and German company DKK Scharfenstein introduced
&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/solar_chill/"&gt;
"Greenfreeze" hydrocarbon refrigerators&lt;/a&gt; into the European
market in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="width: 200px;" class="inlinebox"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Greenpeacebegan research on Greenfreeze (hydrocarbon) refrigeration technology toreduce the destruction of the ozone layer. It is now a highlysuccessful example of a green organisation and industry workingtogether..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ==UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking at the launch of the Sustainable Development Commission (October 2000).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todayfridges made by major European companies such as Siemens
and Bosch arenearly all F-gas free. Big food corporations are
switching to F-gasfree commercial refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But American manufacturerscontinue to expand their use of
F-gases, and they're looking for newforeign markets, despite the
documented dangers of these chemicals forour planet's climate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also hold a sizeable market sharein Europe, and have not
been idle in trying to ensure that profits, notthe planet, are
primary on the EU agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The counterforce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" style="margin: 4px;" src="/international/PageFiles/25633/mahi-sideridou-she-doesn-t-al.jpg"&gt;
Enter Mahi Sideridou, one of the secret weapons in the
Greenpeacearsenal. You won't have seen pictures of her handcuffed
to an anchorchain or hanging a banner from a smokestack. As a
Greenpeace climateand energy policy advisor stationed in Brussels,
she's more likely tobe decked out in a smart suit than a wetsuit,
working the corridors ofthe European Parliament. And if it weren't
for her nearly lonepresence, the industry would be the only point
of view that EuropeanMinisters would hear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I'm totally outnumbered here" she saidin a recent phone
interview. "There are dozens of industry lobbyistsyammering on
about how these climate-killing chemicals are 'a part ofthe social
fabric of Europe' and suggesting that banning them will
meandisaster for European industry. When I tell parliamentarians
that thehome refrigeration market has already demonstrated that
alternativesare available and commercially proven, it's often the
first they'veheard that alternatives even exist."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because she works forGreenpeace, Mahi has found herself excluded
from the back-roomdiscussions that industry flacks like to have
with parliamentarians inprivate. But despite the smart suit, Mahi
is Greenpeace: getting into aclosed door meeting --like getting
into the grounds of a nuclear powerplant -- just takes a bit of
determination and inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I found out about a closed lunch session that was being held
the dayof a debate between Parliamentarians on F-gases. Industry
was going totell key parliamentarians why they should water down
legislation thatwe thought was weak already. I called the German
Liberal partyrepresentative who was hosting it and asked if I could
be included togive a balanced view. He replied that there was no
room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I said I was a very small person, but he didn't seem to get the
joke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I called the UK Liberal representative and asked him if he'd
knownabout the meeting, as the issue was technically his area
ofresponsibility. He invited me to come along as his guest. This
didn'tgo down very well at the door, and they insisted there was
only a placefor one. The British MEP graciously excused himself and
instructed thatI be given his chair. Had I not been there, nobody
would havechallenged the "facts" according to Hill and Knowlton,
the industry'sPR company, which turned out to be running the
lunch."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard work and hard information led the EU environment committee
topropose extremely aggressive controls on the F-gas industry.
Butall that fell victim today to a well-funded industry
assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Why would a PR company be lobbying the
EU?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most vocal lobby on the F-gas regulation has undoubtedly
come fromthe F-gas producers themselves. But they generally do so
in disguise.If you, as a parliamentarian, were asked to take a
meeting with the'European Partnership for Energy and the
Environment' to hear theirviews on F-gas regulation, you'd probably
expect to be meeting withenvironmentalists. From Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'd be wrong on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's actually an industry front group, made up largely of
American andJapanese multinationals with plants in Europe, who are
lobbying againstregulation of F-gases out of cost concerns. And
while their &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.epeeglobal.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;makes a flashy show of
how their chemicals don't destroy the ozone(which is true) they
fail to mention that they're contributing toglobal warming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's exactly the kind of economy with thetruth you could expect
from a smarmy PR agency. In this case, Hill&amp;amp; Knowlton is
painting DuPont and other f-gas manufacturers inearth-friendly
shades of green for their wonderful ozone-friendlychemicals. 
Ironically, Hill &amp;amp; Knowlton is exactly the samecompany which,
in 1975, trotted out reports and scientists claimingthat the Ozone
hole was a myth, environmentalists were scare-mongering,and
industry shouldn't be required to take costly and unnecessary
action to ban CFCs.  They now make flashanimations which pat
themselves on the back for not making the ozonehole any bigger than
the 8 times larger than Europe that it already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Democracy: on sale now at prices any
multinational can afford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current EU legislation, lobby groups such as the
EuropeanPartnership for Energy and the Environment are not required
to revealtheir funding sources. Unless MEPs do some digging, or
Greenpeace orClimate Action Network tells them, decision-makers
might never knowthat the same multinationals which are making money
off pollutingchemicals are the ones asking them not to regulate
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as Sideridou points out, that's not the only place where
democracy fails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Whilethe parliamentary discussions and votes are open and
transparent, thediscussions of the environment ministers are
closed. So we have todepend on leaks to find out what's happening
behind those closed doors."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the environment committee of the European Parliament
recentlyendorsed the tough legislation which went to the full
Parliament, theindustry responded with a detailed action plan. It
instructs theirlobbyists to "raise safety issues," "call to
question the committee'scompetency," "find friends who can put
doubt on results...and carry themessage to wider parliament." What
are friends for?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,industry's friends succeeded in weakening what
would have been a goodstep toward addressing global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why does anyone vote against phasing out a harmful,
man-madegreenhouse gas if alternatives are commercially available
and alreadyon the market? The companies that produce fluorinated
gases have arguedthat life as we know it would come to a halt if
these chemicals weregradually replaced. This couldn't befurther
from the truth. The European Parliament has today failed in itsduty
to act inthe interests of the public and the environment," said
Sideridou.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while she found today's vote particularly depressing, she's
not quitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I've taken this very, very personally. A year ago I thought
aboutgiving up --wondering what the point of banging my head
against thewall might be. But the motivation for staying is that if
you leave theother side wins. And when you're right, you just can't
let the otherside win."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sign up as an energy revolutionary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GreenfreezeSignUp"&gt;Sign up for a free e-zine and action alerts about how you can help build a green and peaceful future: and how you can make sure the next vote goes differently.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us in our work against global warming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GreenfreezeSignUp"&gt;Greenpeace never made any money on Greenfreeze technology.  We decided against sharing in the profits of this solution, in order to ensure our independence. We continue to rely on individual donations as our primary source of operating funds.  Help us carry on the fight with whatever you can spare.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After Katrina, Rita, and Stan, Hurricane Wilma has left another trail of devastation through the Caribbean, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Western Cuba and Florida.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Man braves flood waters in his destroyed village during the aftermath of Hurricane Stan. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands left homeless by extensive flooding in Mexico.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico and Florida were hardest hit by Wilma. Mexico has just
suffered extensiveflooding, landslides and loss of life due to
Hurricane Stan. OnWednesday 19 Oct, Wilma was measured as the
strongest hurricane everyrecorded. The 2005 North Atlantic
hurricane season has been one of themost intense since records
began in 1851. Only 1969 had as manyhurricanes as this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Out of names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the body responsible for naming hurricanes will have
tostart with the Greek alphabet if there is a new hurricane this
season,having run out of suitable letters in the alphabet to name
hurricanesin 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unparalleled destruction due to hurricanes and the Amazon
Rainforestsuffering &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/slideshows/amazondroughtbrazil"&gt;
severe drought&lt;/a&gt; might be providing a little peek into ourfuture
shaped by global warming. A warmer world will experience manymore
extreme weather events like droughts, storms and floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change,hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming more intense
and moredamaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of
globalwarming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans
startedheating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by
whilehurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet, gather
strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hurricanes and droughts hit the headlines and thousands of
peoplelose their lives there is strangely little news about the
urgentinternational action required to tackle global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global gamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could wait with our fingers crossed, hoping the worst of
thepredictions don't come true, although with every passing week,
eventsand the evidence stack up to suggest it's the worst possible
option forthe planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions are here - clean renewable energy and energy
efficiencymeasures can be implemented now and this must be better
than taking agamble with the planet - as the last few weeks have
shown we wouldcertainly lose that gamble, big time.&lt;/p&gt;

	Everyone knows it's illegal to import pirated CDs and DVDs, with heavy penalties if you get caught, but what happens when you import stolen timber from the world's last ancient forests? Absolutely nothing.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/10/greenpeace-activists-dump-over-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

            Greenpeace activists dump over a tonne of plywood secured with large chains blocking the entrance to DEFRA, the UK Government's department responsible for the environment. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon lost an area roughly the size of Belgium last year,
and theParadise Forests of South East Asia are disappearing so
rapidly, thattheir most famous residents, orang-utans, are facing
extinction in thewild within the next decade. The African Forests
of the Great Apes issimilarly facing a huge assault. Why? Illegal
and destructive logging,driven by demand for cheap wood from
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, in the port city of Livorno, Italy, we &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/action-on-illegal-logging-ital/"&gt;
blocked&lt;/a&gt; the unloadingof the freighter '&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/simillegalcameroon.pdf"&gt;
Guan He Kou&lt;/a&gt;' which was carrying timber from a companyinvolved
in illegal logging in the Congo Basin. The presence of the'Guan He
Kou' and its rainforest cargo in Europe shows just how easy itis to
steal from some of the most biologically rich areas in the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activists were arrested, the ship continued to deliver
thetimber before sailing to Spain, where we greeted it again in the
portof Valencia on Monday. No inspections, no seizure of the stolen
goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies that log the tropical timber are known to
beinvolved in criminal activities. In Papua New Guinea, for
example, thelogging industry is dominated by Malaysian logging
giant &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/RH_Forest_Report.pdf"&gt;
RimbunanHijau&lt;/a&gt;, a company that has been directly linked not only
toenvironmental destruction, but also to human rights abuses
includingtorture and rape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in the UK, activists &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/criminal-rainforest-timber-tra/"&gt;
blockaded&lt;/a&gt; the offices of the environmentdepartment in protest
at the lack of action to prohibit the importationof illegal
timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="223231" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments around the world have known about thisproblem for
years and they've done absolutely nothing about it.Illegally logged
timber products from the world's last rainforests aresold openly
around the world. This criminal trade must be
prohibitedimmediately," said Phil Aikman, Greenpeace International
forestscampaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's (EC) response to the issue of illegal
logginghas so far been weak. It is promoting voluntary measures,
despite callsfrom 180 NGOs, the European Parliament and 70
companies (including Ikeaand B&amp;amp;Q), who have all called for
legislation which stops theimport of illegally sourced timber
products into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This voluntary approach is an inadequate and untenable position,
notjust for consumers in Europe who are unknowingly complicit in
forestcrimes, but also for the people of timber-producing
countries. TheWorld Bank estimates that illegal logging costs
timber-producingcountries between US$10 and15 billion a year in
lost revenue. Forestdwelling people in countries like Cameroon,
Papua New Guinea and Brazilcannot afford to have their livelihoods
stolen from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps in protecting the ancient forest is the
introduction of laws prohibiting the import of illegal timber.While
the European Commission drags its feet, the forests continue tobe
destroyed and the people that depend on them for their way of
lifecontinue to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Matti Wuori, founder of Greenpeace Finland and the former Board Chair of Greenpeace International from 1991 - 1993. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matti was a Renaissance man who could read 13 languages and was
asarticulate about art, literature, and music as he was outspoken
abouthuman rights and environmentalism.  He believed passionately
inthe importance of non-governmental organisations (NGO's) as a
foil tocorporations and governments in civil society, and he served
as anadviser or board member to more than a dozen of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti Wuori was a strong, visionary voice within civil society
groupsin Europe. He worked tirelessly to protect the environment
and humanrights, as well as strengthen the position of
non-governmentalorganisations in society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wuori was a 'global citizen' in the true meaning of the word.
He didnot hesitate to criticise polluting governments and companies
whoviolate legal and ethical environmental guidelines" said
ExecutiveDirector, Lennart Daleus at Greenpeace Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti's work at Greenpeace was not complete. This autumn he was
set tolead a fact-finding mission on the violation of international
law inlogging operations in the indigenous Sámi homeland in
Northern Finland.Wuori was committed to represent the Sámi reindeer
herders at theEuropean Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I remember well how Matti reminded NGO activists in Brussels
that thecore business of any NGO should be to pose nasty questions
todecision-makers. Matti wanted non-governmental organisations to
work aswatch dogs and alarm clocks in society. He often reminded us
about thedangers of becoming marionettes for governments or
companies. Wepromise to live up to his expectations and carry on
his impressivework" said Campaign Director, Mads Christensen at
Greenpeace Nordic inHelsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti was chairman of Greenpeace International from 1991 to
1993. Anincredibly talented environmental and human rights
campaigner, Mattiplayed a series of very significant roles here at
Greenpeace. Hisenergy and commitment will be greatly missed" said
Jeanne Moffat, BoardMember of Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti  was also a board member of Greenpeace in the Czech
republicand Hungary until his death. In addition to his work
atGreenpeace,  Matti was a prominent Finnish lawyer and
formerMember of the EuropeanParliament. He also worked as an
adviser to the South African Truth andReconciliation Commission
from 1996 until 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rich and varied lifetime, Matti was called upon to
giveexpert testimony in spotting fraudulent artwork, acted in a
featurefilm (in which he played, not surprisingly, a Finnish
lawyer), servedon the board of the Avanti! chamber orchestra, wrote
two books andlectured on human rights, democracy, and
constitutional law. He wasalso known to dance an inimitable
jitterbug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti succumbed to a long battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He was that rarest of combinations: a scholar and an
activist. He'd looked human civilization hard in the eye, saw it
for what it was,and set about the task of redressing its ills,
while never losing sightof its beauty," said Greenpeace
International Board Chair Anne Summers.&lt;/p&gt;

	When you live off the land any change in climate can have profound effects. This Tibetan woman used to have a healthy herd of animals to support her family. Now due to the lack of rain and spreading deserts on the Tibetan plateau her income has disappeared. Try telling her that global warming isn't a reality.

            A 31-year-old Tibetan woman at her home in Yellow River township. Once she lived well from the profits off her animals. Now, due to climate change, she is reduced to a life of poverty. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as the roof of the
world, landof high peaks, glaciers and nomadic tribal peoples. The
snowy peaks andglaciers are the source of many of Asia's mightiest
rivers - theGanges, Mekong and China's Yellow River. This area is
predicted to warmconsiderably before 2100 due to global warming.
The roof of the worldis melting, and melting fast.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;A little less ice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what's the big deal about a little less ice in a place full
of thestuff anyway? Actually it's a disaster for the region now, 
and theramifications may yet be felt across the globe. We visited
the region tohighlight the impacts of the changing climate of the
Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the area warms less rain is falling and glaciers in the
region aremelting. Local communities used to make a living of their
herds ofanimals grazing on lush mountain pastures. Now those
pastures are fastturning to desert due to lack of water,
overgrazing and erosion causedby new animals that are thriving in
the warmer conditions. Many localpeople now survive solely on
government handouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/globalwarmingyellowrivermaduo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Onour expedition to the region we travelled on "dancing roads"
distortedby melting permafrost to meet the governor of Madoi
County. In 1980, Madoi wasChina's richest province due to its
agricultural wealth. It is  now China'spoorest. We interviewed
once-prosperous, but now destitute,farmers and saw first hand the
desert gobbling up pasture land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is causing a cocktail of environmental effects at
theYellow River source that threaten an ecological breakdown. When
you seethe empty wells, bridges over nothing but dry dirt, cracked
groundwhere there should be lakes, bare rock and sand where it was
oncehealthy grassland you know something is seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/10/yellow-river-site.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See more impacts in the region at our Yellow River site in &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://www.yellowriversource.org/cn.html"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the immediate impacts on the area are bad enough they
palecompared to the possible future impacts in the rest of China.
TheYellow River has fed China's people since time immemorial.
Today, 120million Chinese people, a tenth of China's population,
rely on theriver, especially for irrigating crops. As well as being
known asChina's 'mother river', is also dubbed the 'cradle of the
Chinesecivilization'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell"&gt;
&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Nowthe mother river is drying up at its source. In many places
onthe upper stretches the flow is much reduced. If the flow of the
rivercontinues to decline it threatens the food supplies for a
large part ofChina's population.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;Alarm bell for the world&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butthis isn't just a problem for China. Many of Asia's rivers
begin on theTibetan Plateau. If it continues to dry this could
affect many ofthese rivers and the millions of people who rely on
them. As well as water shortages, scientistspredict that rising
temperatures will reduce the rice crops that arethe staple food for
more than half of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How would the world feed millions of people who cannot rely on locally produced rice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Yellow River source region is an urgent warning that climate
changeis harming people now and is going to get worse. The Yellow
River storyis not just about China, it's a warning signal that we
need  worldwideaction on global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action on global warming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;Even if you never see the Yellow River you can do something about global warming with these steps for individual action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_127"&gt;Support our fight against global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nobel Peace Prize, founded on a fortune made from explosives, has gone to the agency whose job it is to promote nuclear power without promoting nuclear weapons, and the man who heads it. Anybody with that job probably deserves some kind of prize.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Littering the planet with nuclear power plants won't put a lid on nuclear weapons.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed ElBaradei is the head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency(IAEA), both winners of this year's Nobel Peace
Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency is tasked with policing the spread of nuclearweapons
at the same time it is charged with promoting the verytechnologies
and materials used to make nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a job worthy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In opposing the Iraq war and championing a nuclear-free Middle
East,ElBaradei has in recent years been a voice of sanity in the
world ofnuclear non-proliferation. Here's what he had to say
aboutnuclear weapons in The Economist in October 2003:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. I worry about nuclear
weapons falling intothe hands of terrorists or ruthless dictators.
I worry about nuclearweapons already in the arsenals of democracies
- because as long asthese weapons exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft,
sabotage or accidental launch,and even democracies are not immune
to radical shifts in their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.
I worry, but I also hope. Ihope that a side-effect of globalisation
will be an enduringrealisation that there is only one human race,
to which we allbelong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoken like a Peace Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Mr. Hyde side of his job is to be the UN's front man for
thenuclear industry, peddling more nuclear power to more countries.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, Mr. ElBaradei, is the part of your job that worries us. 
You see, we worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. We worry about nuclear
materialsfalling into the hands of terrorists or ruthless
dictators. We worryabout nuclear materials that are already in
nuclear power plants andreprocessing plants and storage facilities.
Because as long asthese materials exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft or
sabotage, and evendemocracies are not immune to radical shifts in
their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this award will spark a new discussion around
thefundamental contradiction of the International Atomic Energy
Agency'sdual role as nuclear policeman and nuclear salesman. Only
once thatduality is removed can the IAEA truly focus on the
pressing threat ofthe global spread of nuclear weapons technology,
both civil andmilitary.&lt;/p&gt;

While competitors like Sony Ericssonand Nokia are living up to their commitments to remove toxic chemicals,Motorola is not answering the call to clean up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are chemicals in products important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many chemicals found in everyday products are now common
environmentalpollutants and are found in animals and humans. Almost
everyone hasdozens of man-made chemicals in their body; the effects
of thesechemical cocktails on our health are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these voluntary company measures are good news, other
companieswill never change unless the law forces them to. Only then
will thesetoxic chemicals be fully phased out and substituted with
saferalternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about those laws?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current regulation of chemicals is weak and inadequate. Toxic
chemicalsare found from the Arctic to the Alps. The European Union
(EU) isdrafting new chemical law that would set a world standard,
but to beeffective the new law must identify all hazardous
chemicals and requiretheir substitution with safer
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical contamination? No Thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While better chemical regulation should be welcomed by all, it
is underattack from predictable quarters. The chemical industry has
beenscare-mongering with exaggerated claims of job losses and
decliningprofits.It has also recruited dirty industry's best
friend, the BushAdministration, to threaten the EU with a World
Trade Organisationlawsuit if it dares to try and cut toxic
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to counter inaccurate industry lobbying is to have
othercompanies demonstrate that they can do without toxic
chemicals. It remains to beseen if European members of parliament
will side with the people andprogressive companies by voting for
strong chemical law. Or will theyprefer the lobbying and
scare-mongering of dirty industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take a stand for safer chemicals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org/"&gt;We need your voice for safer chemicals to show politicians the need to put the public before dirty industry profits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=167_101"&gt;Help our work for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	"Even in an unclassified world this is not the kind of thing you want flying around the Internet," says Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita. He was talking about a document, yanked from a Pentagon website on September 19th, which outlines US nuclear warfighting plans, including the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons and the use of nukes in conventional war.

Comments to the document by the various military branches&lt;/a&gt;
revealsquabbling about who gets to run a nuclear war, a
disagreement aboutthe legality of pre-emptive warfighting
strategies, and a discussion ofthe etiquette of alerting allied
troops that a nuclear attack is comingtheir way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/jcs/canceled.htm"&gt;This is
exactly the kind ofinformation which we believe &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ought&lt;/span&gt; to be flying
around the internet; these guys really shouldn't be left alone to
talkabout this stuff behind closed doors.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/jcs/canceled.htm"&gt;Sowe took
our copy and uploaded it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/US-joint-nuclear-operations"&gt;
here atwww.greenpeace.org&lt;/a&gt;.  You can help ensure it flies around
theinternet some more by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/nuclear-warplans-101?mode=send"&gt;
sending this article to a friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;UpdateFebruary, 2006:  The Joint Nuclear
Operations Doctrine andfourother documents have been formally
cancelled by thePentagon. However, this means no substantive change
to US nuclear policy, onlythat the documents have been removed from
the public domain and thePentagon reading list.  &lt;a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/jcs/canceled.htm"&gt;More
informationfrom the Federation of Amercian Scientists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear war: it's not just for breakfast anymore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thedocument is a rare unpolished look at how the Cold War
doctrine ofnuclear first strike - previously spun as "deterrence" -
has taken on anew dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reveals that the threshold for actually using nuclearweapons
has been lowered dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it outs the untruth ofGeorge Bush claiming that the US is
reducing the importance of itsnuclear arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the document condones pre-emptivenuclear strikes
against nations (even those without nuclear weapons)which the US
government &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;thinks&lt;/span&gt;
might use chemical or biological weaponsagainst US forces or
allies. The document also condones the use ofnuclear weapons as
just another item in the warfighting toolbox, andunderscores the
importance of US troops being able to continuefunctioning in a
highly irradiated battle zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;Thedocument has excellent, practical advice on
how to deal with situationslike a nuclear foe who might retaliate
with nuclear weapons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Executinga nuclear option, or even a portion of an option, should send a clearsignal of United States' resolve. Hence, options must be selected verycarefully and deliberately so that the attack can help ensure theadversary recognizes the "signal" and should therefore not assume theUnited States has escalated to general nuclear war, although thatperception cannot be guaranteed." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It's
comforting to know thatthe Pentagon recognises that nuclear weapons
are very, very bad atconveying nuanced messages. Perhaps if they
accompanied the attack witha thoughtful card, that would help make
their meaning clear? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Fission vision sparks division&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,editing notes show internal disagreement amongst US
militarycommanders. The disputes are over the document's enthusiasm
for usingnuclear weapons in attacks on infrastructure which would
inevitablylead to massive civilian casualties. Some commanders
expressed extremedoubts over both the legality of the new nuclear
doctrine, and that thethreats used to justify this new doctrine
actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;inline_item item_id="209990" mode="story"&gt;The USstrategic command, STRATCOM, which directs nuclear
warfightingcommented "Many operational law attorneys do not believe
"countervalue"targeting is a lawful justification for employment of
force, much lessnuclear force. Countervalue philosophy makes no
distinction betweenpurely civilian activities and military-related
activities and could beused to justify deliberate attacks on
civilians and non-militaryportions of a nation's economy... For
example, under the countervaluetarget philosophy, the attack on the
World Trade Centre Towers on 9/11could be justified."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since it's not illegal, it must be ok&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ina chilling finale, "Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations"
concludesthat "no customary or conventional international law
prohibits nationsfrom employing nuclear weapons in armed
conflict." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeacedisarmament campaigner William Peden said, "This
document should send ashiver down the spine of everyone. It shows

<item><language>en</language><title>Storm Warnings Intensify</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/storm-warnings-intensify/</url><text>
	As this season’s hurricanes slam into our coastlines, MIT scientists have hit us with a dose of reality: global warming is to blame. If you thought that hurricanes were creating greater damage, it hasn’t been your imagination. And the most distressing news is it’s only going to get worse.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Trailer park homes were completely destroyed by hurricane Charlie in 2004.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published by MIT this week, global warming
islikely a major cause of the increased ferocity of hurricanes in
thepast decade. The study, published in the journal Nature, notes
theaccumulated power of hurricanes has more than doubled in the
past 30years, with a particularly dramatic spike since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry Emanuel, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technologyand author of the study writes, "My results suggest that
future warmingmay lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone
destructive potentialand - taking into account an increasing
coastal population - asubstantial increase in hurricane-related
losses in the 21st century."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study should prove particularly interesting for residents
along theGulf Coast and throughout the Caribbean who are recovering
from whatforecasters call the most active start to the hurricane
season onrecord. In just two months, six storms grew strong enough
to meritnames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the 2004 hurricane season, President Bush
visitedthe National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.  He
addressed thecrowd with this assurance: "I want the people of
Florida and otheraffected areas to know that the federal government
is doing everythingwe can to help you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Not Enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Bush is quick to offer kind words and disaster relief
fundsto victims of hurricanes.  Yet his administration refuses to
takeaction on global warming, which would reduce the power of these
stormsand save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 29, the Senate passed the Energy Bill - despite more
than17,000 of our supporters asking it to reject this
badlegislation.  This bill is a triple cocktail of seismic testing
inour waters, incentives to build new nuclear power plants, and
pay-offsfor fossil-fuel giants like ExxonMobil. It will do
virtually nothing toreduce America's growing dependence on oil and
coal and does notaddress global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Good Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executives at President Bush's favorite oil company,
ExxonMobil,are undoubtedly pleased with with the passage of the
Energy Bill.  But theyhave an even bigger reason to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 28, ExxonMobil released its earnings report for the
secondquarter. In a time of steep gas prices, Exxon has broken all
profitrecords, earning $7.84 billion in net income during the 2nd
quarter,and $15.5 billion for the first half of the year total.  In
fact,the $15.5 billion in profits is a 38 percent increase from the
firsthalf of 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Take Action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your money won't end up in ExxonMobil's next
earningsreport.  Don't buy Exxon or Mobil gas, invest in its stock
or workfor the company.  &lt;a href="http://usactions.greenpeace.org/action/start.php?action_id=59"&gt;
Tell Exxon's CEO that he just lost a customer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT isn't the only one noticing how ferocious hurricanes have
become. Hear from ordinary people whose lives have been affected by
hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;

	Facing down stick-wielding personnel, water-canon-spraying marine police,and gun-wielding navy seals, five Greenpeace activists in Thailand have delayed a shipment of Australian coal from being unloaded at a controversial coal plant in Maptaphut, Thailand.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in Thailand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five activists chained themselves to the pier bumper and
hung banners that read 'Coal = climate change, Clean Energy Now'.
They remained for two hours before being detained by police with
the help of Navy seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 170,00 tonne carrier, MV Star Europe, carrying a large
shipment of coal from Newcastle, NSW (the world's largest coal
exporting port) has been anchored a few nautical miles away,
waiting for the area to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coal plant, BLCP,  is jointly owned by Banpu and Hong Kong
based China Light and scheduled to open in October. BLCP is a
classic example of dirty international financing by the likes of
Asian Development Bank and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The BLCP coal plant will exacerbate the impacts of climate
change, which is already starting to exact a heavy toll on the
people and economies of Thailand and Southeast Asia. It does not
help that Australia is fuelling climate change in the region with
its coal exports," said Tara Buakamsri of Greenpeace Southeast
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thailand must stop any further use of coal and put a policy in
place for the massive increase of renewable energy and energy
efficiency projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1,434 MW BLCP coal plant will release nearly 12 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, and once in operation this
plant alone will cause Thailand's carbon emissions to rise by
almost 6 percent a year, according to Greenpeace projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, emitting 29 percent more
carbon per unit of energy than oil and 80 percent more than gas,
and contributing significantly to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal and coal-fired power stations have been strongly opposed
by communities in the region. However, the Australian government
refuses to take action on global warming while ignoring climate
impacts on its own citizens and other countries in Asia. The whole
region will be further threatened by the increase of investments in
coal power plants across Asia many of which will rely on the supply
of Australian coal." said Catherine Fitzpatrick, Greenpeace
Australia Pacific energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	It's a bluefin tuna graveyard, white crosses float next to tuna ranch cages. We end our three month Mediterranean tour back where we started, in Spain, highlighting the desperate state of bluefin tuna stocks.

            Greenpeace activists from the Rainbow Warrior create a syymbolic "tuna graveyard" with mock crosses inside a tuna ranch in Cartagena, Southeast Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tour that started with the launch of the Greenpeace
tunareport onboard the Esperanza in Barcelona, we've confirmed our
worstfears about the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin
tuna are being plundered, illegal driftnets known as "wallsof
death" continue to be used despite their prohibition and the
rampantoverdevelopment of the Mediterranean coastline is destroying
coastalecosytems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as we showed with the proposal for a network of marine
reserves for the Mediterranean, there is still hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theRainbow Warrior concludes the 2006 tour of the
Mediterranean, we lookback on some of the highlights and many
suprises from the past threemonths. From diving and documenting the
beauty below the surface,confiscating illegal driftnets and
rescuing sailors from sinking boatsto being blockaded by the
fishermen in Marseille, it's certainly been amemorable tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Mediterranean is in desperate need of a sea change
-literally. The large industrial fishing fleets are out of control,
thetuna ranches are out of control, the illegal driftnetters are
out ofcontrol, even the jellyfish are out of control, partly due to
its mainpredators like tuna and sea turtles being wiped out," said

<item><language>en</language><title>Contaminated Chinese rice found in Europe</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/contaminated-chinese-rice090506/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Health risks require immediate recall and import ban&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The genetic engineering industry sank to a new low when it was revealed recently that US company Bayer's field trials of genetically engineered (GE) rice had contaminated rice exports. Japan moved fast and banned the US rice from coming into its ports. The EU quickly followed and placed import restrictions and testing regimes in place.  Now, Greenpeace research has uncovered a new example of contamination of the world's most important staple food. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/products-found-to-contain-ille.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/products-found-to-contain-ille.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Products found to contain illegal and untested genetically engineered rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently uncovered, and independently verified, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/IllegalChinaGErice"&gt;
that illegal GE rice from China has contaminated food products&lt;/a&gt;
in France, Germany and the UK. We've notified authorities that the
illegal GE rice poses serious health risks and we're calling upon
European governments to take immediate action to protect
consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace offices and Friends of the Earth in the UK tested
samples of rice products such as vermicelli, rice sticks and other
processed foods. Five positive samples were found containing an
illegal GE organism not approved anywhere in the world. However
this may only be the tip of the iceberg. Rice products are included
in everything from baby food to yoghurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level
responses", said Jeremy Tager, GE rice campaigner, Greenpeace
International. "Consumers should not be left swallowing
experimental GE rice that is risky to their health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice, genetically engineered to be resistant to
insects, contains a protein or fused protein (Cry1Ac) that has
reportedly induced allergic-like reactions in mice. Three
independent scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ScientistStatementHealthConcernsGErice" target="_blank"&gt;issued a statement backing the health concerns we
raised&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International is calling for immediate worldwide
recall, measures to ensure no further contaminated rice enters the
EU and the urgent implementation of a preventative screening system
for countries with high contamination risks. Demanding GE-free
certification for food from countries that grow and produce GE
crops is reasonable, cost effective, and necessary to protect
Europe's consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bayer's illegal GE rice in the US, this recent rice
contamination in China began with field trials; the rice is not
currently approved for commercial growing because of mounting
concerns over its safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innocent consumers again become the victims," says Tager. 
"Once illegal GE crops are in the food chain, removing them takes
enormous effort and cost. It is easier to prevent contamination in
the first place," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that
is grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens
biodiversity and poses unacceptable risks to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GE_rice_signup"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GE_rice_donate"&gt;In order to maintain our independence, we don't accept funding from governments or corporations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Click here for the ranking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranking is important because the amounts of toxic e-waste isgrowing everyday and it often ends up dumped in the developing world.Reducing the toxic chemicals in products reduces pollution from oldproducts and makes recycling safer, easier and cheaper. Companies withgood recycling schemes help ensure that their products don't end up inthe e-waste yards of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The scorecard will provide a dynamic tool to green the electronicssector by setting off a race to the top. By taking back their discardedproducts, companies will have incentives to eliminate harmfulsubstances used in their products, since this is the only way they canensure safe reuse and recycling of electronic waste," said Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nokia-rank/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-dell-ranki/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt; share the top spot in the ranking. They believe that asproducers they should bear individual responsibility for taking backand reusing or recycling their own-brand discarded products. Nokialeads the way on eliminating toxic chemicals, since the end of 2005 allnew models of mobiles are free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and all newcomponents to be free of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from thestart of 2007. Dell has also set ambitious targets for eliminatingthese harmful substances from their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third place goes to &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-hp-ranking/"&gt; HP&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-erics/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; (4th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-samsung-ra/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; (5th),&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-ranki/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt; (6th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-lg-electro/"&gt; LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt; (7th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-panasonic/"&gt; Panasonic&lt;/a&gt; (8th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-toshiba-ra/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; (9th),&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-fujitsu-si/"&gt; Fujitsu Siemens Computers&lt;/a&gt; (10th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; (11th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-acer-ranki/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; (12th) and&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-motorola-r/"&gt; Motorola&lt;/a&gt; (13th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-lenovo-ran/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; is in bottom position. It earns points for chemicals managementand providing some voluntary product take back programmes, but it needsto do better on all criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is disappointing to see &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank/"&gt; Apple ranking&lt;/a&gt; so low in the overall guide.They are meant to be world leaders in design and marketing, they shouldalso be world leaders in environmental innovation." said Kruszewska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have the opportunity to move towards a greener ranking as theguide will be updated every quarter. However penalty points will bededucted from overall scores if we find a company lying, practisingdouble standards or other corporate misconduct. For now, companies arescored solely on information publicly available on their globalwebsites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a average score of only 4/10 it is clear that the electronicsindustry has a long way to go before it can make any claims to being agreen industry.&lt;/p&gt;

	(UPDATED) The port of Marseille is refusing to let our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, dock and some French tuna fishermen are in uproar - thanks to our work highlighting widespread overfishing and illegalities in the Mediterranean tuna industry.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A large purse seiner comes dangerously close alongside the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="#update"&gt;Jump to update.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SinceMay, the Rainbow Warrior has been documenting the state of
theMediterranean Sea, including the activities of Spanish,
French,Italian, Turkish and Japanese bluefin tuna
fishingvessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found is overfishing on a massivescale, and an industry
that routinely ignores quotas and regulations.An estimated 45,000
tons of tuna was taken from the Mediterranean lastyear - while the
legal quota is only 32,000 tons.  French,Libyan and Turkish tuna
fisherman all stand accused of illegallyfishing over their quotas,
and some French fisherman have even admittedas much to the media.
No wonder the bluefin tuna stock here is in sucha dire state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stephan Beaucher ofGreenpeace France put it, "Leading
scientists and environmental groupsagree that the blue fin tuna
stock is on the verge of collapse in theMediterranean as a result
of over fishing." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The confrontation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becausegovernments and industry won't tackle the issue, we were
taking ourmessage direct to the people of France.  But the
government ofMarseille and the tuna industry don't want our message
heard, and aredoing everything they can to keep us from even coming
intoport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on June 27th, we were granted permissionto dock in
Marseille, but this week that permission was revoked for"technical
and security reasons" (with no furtherexplanation).  As the Rainbow
Warrior approached the port,over 20 industrial fishing vessels
surrounded it.  Our shipdropped anchor about a mile out. Now, we're
ferrying journalists out byboat to talk to them about the sorry
state of the bluefin tuna stock,and the need for marine reserves in
theMediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These fisherman may have dirtysecrets to hide," said Karli
Thomas by phone from the deck of theRainbow Warrior, "But they
won't let them stop us from bringing theplight of the tuna to
light."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="update" href="#" name="update"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE (day 2):  Rainbow Warrior boarded andtowed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25520/industrial-tuna-fishing-ships.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followingan additional confrontation this morning where tuna
fishermen blockadedand boarded the Rainbow Warrior as well as fire
hosing its crew; ourship is now being towed out of France's 12 mile
territorial zone by theFrench authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tuna fishermen are out ofcontrol on the high seas and now
they are out of control in port," saidKarli Thomas, on board the
Rainbow Warrior. "These industrial tunafishermen blockading us need
to take responsibility for their part inthe depleted state of the
Mediterranean tuna fishery and look at thebigger picture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Rainbow Warrior has broken nolaws and the source of the
tension is coming from the French tunafisherman," said Mike Finken,
captain of the Rainbow Warrior. "TheRainbow Warrior is capable of
leaving under its own propulsion and aswe made clear yesterday it
had planned to do so at 6pm today to setsail for Spain to continue
Greenpeace's campaign to raise awareness ofthe threats facing the
Mediterranean Sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomascontinued, "They should support our call for establishment
of a networkof marine reserves to bring about a sustainable,
healthy and productiveMediterranean Sea. It is in the long term
interests of the environmentand all fishing communities, both in
France and the rest of theMediterranean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rainbow Warrior crew weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/defendingourmediterranean/"&gt;Updates from the crew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In French&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/france/news/marseille-le-point-a-8h30"&gt;Updates to the story in French.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bay wasonce considered one of the most beautiful in the
world, now it is oneof the most polluted.  Sludge, human sewage,
industrial waste and,especially, plain garbage foul the water. 
Much of the garbage isplastic from 'single use' sources - that is
plastic bags, beveragebottles, cups and other items intended to be
used once and thrown away.Most of these plastics come from
land-based sources and are carriedalong deltas of rivers and
estuaries, smothering mangrove trees andother marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines also has some of the bestexamples of communities
protecting their marine resources.  We'llbe visiting two such
places - Donsol and Apo Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="continue_slideshow" href="#" name="continue_slideshow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theplankton-rich waters of the municipality of Donsol are known
feedinggrounds for whale sharks. These largest fish of the sea are
celebrityanimals. Time magazine in 2004 called the Donsol whale
shark experiencethe "Best Animal Encounter in Asia". The thousands
of tourists whoflock to Donsol yearly seem to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epicentre of thewhale sharks' activity is undeniably Donsol.
But come migration time,the neighbouring municipalities of Bacon
and Rapu Rapu find themselvesvisited by these gentle giants as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Apo Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knownaround the world as one of the best examples of a
community-managedmarine reserve, Apo Island is a small, steep
volcanic island surroundedby narrow fringing coral reefs. The
waters around it are home to 650species of fish and 400 species of
corals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time,however, when the fish were not so abundant.
Decades ago the islandersused dynamite for fishing, and practised
other unsustainable methods.Eking out a living as a fisherman
became more and more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coralreef protection in Apo Island began informally in 1982
under a MarineConservation Development Program started by Silliman
University in thePhilippines.  At first the local community was
sceptical, so theproject began on a small scale.  As fish catches
improved theislanders became convinced.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, the island communityand local council formalized the
sanctuary, declaring waterssurrounding the island up to 500 metres
from the shore a marine reserve,and a portion of the coast in the
south-eastern part of the island ano-take fish sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community now plays a major rolein protecting their marine
resources in a model we hope will spread toother parts of the
Philippines and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rapu Rapu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theisland of Rapu Rapu is in many ways similar to Donsol and
ApoIsland.  Rapu Rapu's surrounding waters also teem with
marinelife.  Its locals also depend on the sea for
theirlivelihood.  But there is an important and loomingdifference. 
Rapu Rapu has a large open pit mine - run byAustralian company
Lafayette.  This mine was temporarily closedafter two toxic spills
last year, but recently re-opened despite therecommendation of a
presidential fact finding commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReynaldoCotorno, a Rapu Rapu fisherman who had waded out to fish
on October11th recounted what happened when the first spill reached
theocean.  As he put it, "I was wearing trousers at the time. The
seawater stung as if there were insects, but that was not
it. Perhaps it was the chemicals that caused the fish to die. There
werereally a lot of dead fish, big and small ones together with
shellfish." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the presidential commission determined, another suchspill is
not necessary to demonstrate that mining operations will beseverely
detrimental to Rapu Rapu, and its surrounding waters. Initial
ecological and health studies on the Rapu-Rapu mine warned ofheavy
metal contamination, siltation and other acute and long-termimpacts
on the marine ecosystem, including the complications of acidmine
drainage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, a Greenpeace report revealed that RapuRapu residents
only stand to gain about US$0.04 (PhP2.00) per capitaincome per day
during the mine's seven-year of operation. This amountdoes not even
look into the environmental, health and social costs thatthe local
population will incur from the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islanders knowthat the fate of their community is linked to the
health of theocean.  Thinking of his children, fisherman Cotorno
said, "Inshort, I am against the mine because I am thinking of the
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign the petition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2189327"&gt;Help Philippines Ocean Defenders resist the mine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=espphilippines"&gt;Donate and become a member today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	John Lundberg, a professional cropcircle maker talks about his latest work, a giant question mark in a maize field in Mexico and working with us.

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mexico-crop-circle1.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists protest against the contamination of Mexico's maize supply from genetically engineered maize.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For years I'd thought that crop circles would be an ideal
medium forpromoting Greenpeace's genetic engineering (GE) campaign.
The cropcircles generate an alien mystique, encouraging people to
consider theunknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/"&gt;
GE campaign&lt;/a&gt; aims to prevent alien organisms from contaminating
ourplants and food, while raising awareness of the unknown
consequencesthat could arise from such material entering the food
chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiscombination of mystery, creativity and an underlying message
perfectlyreflects the work that Greenpeace is doing worldwide. It
was alsoembodied in the formation we created for them - a 65 meter
(200 feet)circle with a question mark at its centre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why a question mark?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Forthousands of years, maize (corn) has been an essential food
for thepeople of Mexico; it also plays an integral part in their
culture andreligion. Unfortunately, in recent years the maize has
been tainted byGE varieties entering the country and being planted
by unaware farmers.As a result, normally GE-free maize is showing
signs of geneticcontamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question mark conveys a simple message -contamination is
happening, but nobody knows exactly where it is takingplace, nor
where it could lead for the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after our crop circle creation we were transported to a
tiny village called Cuanajo in the state of Michoacan. A
celebration was held to honour the regions GE free status. The
festival was an amazing cultural experience, each type of maize has
a purpose. Maize for tortillas, tamales, atoles, pozole, animal
feed and also to create handcrafts which they sell in market
stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting this precious diversity is paramount for the people,
regional government, scientists and environmental groups who have
all worked together to cement the region as GE free. Other
surrounding regions are also interested in following this example
to create their own GE free zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themore I find out about the issues surrounding GE, especially
withinMexico, the happier I am to have been involved in this
project. Withliterally thousands of different strains of maize in
Mexico, it'svitally important for both its people, and the rest of
the world, tokeep the seeds clean and maintain their variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-mexico/"&gt;Greenpeace in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;
was a rewarding and fun experience - even duringthe rainy season!
Circlemakers hope to continue our relationship withGreenpeace and I
also hope that Mexico can successfully rid itself ofgenetic
contamination and keep its maize GE-free."&lt;/p&gt;

	Over 75 tons of essential medical supplies have been safely transported to Lebanon via sea, following a joint operation between Greenpeace and Medecins Sans Frontieres, in which three voyages were made by the Rainbow Warrior between Larnaca in Cyprus and Beirut. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian cargos consisted of essential relief equipment,
including medical equipment, dialysis material, drugs, hygiene kits
and fuel, which was transported on the three shuttle voyages,
starting on 2 August and ending today at 0900 when the Rainbow
Warrior arrived back in Larnaca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are very happy to have been able to play our part in
delivering much needed humanitarian supplies to parts of Lebanon
which have become inaccessible due to the current conflict" said
Bruno Rebelle, programme director of Greenpeace International. "The
crew and volunteers on board the Rainbow Warrior worked tirelessly
to load and transport the cargo under difficult conditions, and
have completed the missions in a professional and efficient
manner."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every stage, Greenpeace and MSF ensured through close liaison
safe passage for the ship and crew. On each leg of the journey
between Larnaca and Beirut the Rainbow Warrior obtained security
clearance with the Israeli Defence Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are very grateful to Greenpeace and the crew and volunteers
aboard the Rainbow Warrior. Use of the ship has allowed us to
transport large volumes of relief goods into Beirut, which had
previously been a major logistical problem due to damaged roads and
lack of security guarantees on vehicles." said Jérôme Oberreit,
operational director for MSF in Brussels. "MSF's challenge now is
to continue that transport on land from Beirut to the south of
Lebanon, where the need is most acute."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior will shortly resume her tour of the
Mediterranean to highlight the severe problems for the marine
environment caused by unsustainable and illegal fishing and coastal
development, and continuing Greenpeaces' campaign demanding the
setting up of marine reserves in the Mediterranean and
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres has around 50 international staff
working in areas in Lebanon that are severely affected by the
conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is on supporting
Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health posts and
mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials
(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) to
displaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

	The debate on illegal logging in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is heating up. Rimbunan Hijau (RH), the largest logging company in PNG, commissioned an Australian consultancy company, ITS-Global, to write a report attacking Greenpeace in an attempt to discredit our work in PNG and shore up its deteriorating reputation.

response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; to the ITS-Global report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ITS-Global report, "Whatever it takes: Greenpeace's
anti-forestry campaign in Papua New Guinea", relies on
misinformation and statistics provided by RH. The authors of the
report didn't take the time to talk to landowners or NGOs working
on forest issues in PNG. It appears the report is merely an
exercise in mudslinging by RH against Greenpeace and numerous other
NGOs working to find positive solutions to the mess that is the PNG
forest sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body of evidence against RH and the forestry sector in PNG
flies in the face of the fiction RH is now trying to peddle with
this report. Over the last 15 years the problems surrounding the
PNG timber industry have been documented time and time again by
numerous authoritative commentators. These have included the PNG
Ombudsman Commission, the PNG Department of Labour, Independent
Review Teams, acting on behalf on the Government of PNG and the
World Bank, the PNG National Intelligence Organisation, former
Australian Supreme Court Judge Tos Barnett, and the High Court of
New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently (August 2006) the Australian Conservation
Foundation and the Centre for Environmental Law and Community
Rights (CELCOR) released a &lt;a href="http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=883" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that highlights human rights abuses and
corruption in PNG's large scale forestry sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has prepared a &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/rh-fiction/"&gt;
response to the allegations&lt;/a&gt; against us and others in order to
set the record straight. RH, it appears, can't handle the truth
that large scale industrial operations, like those it runs in PNG
are having a disastrous affect on PNG's forests and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=RH-Response"&gt;Get our free monthly e-zine to find out how you can save ancient forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUpnglogging"&gt;Help us stop the trade in illegal timber.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We don't believe gorillas and forest people should be made homeless by the European construction and furniture industries. That's why we dumped three tonnes of tropical timber in front of France's Agricultural Ministry, crushing fake gorillas, to demand action against the flood of illegal timber from Africa's last ancient forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/soon-africa-s-gorillas-will-on.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/soon-africa-s-gorillas-will-on.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Soon Africa's gorillas will only survive in wildlife parks and zoos if the current forest destruction isn't halted.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The African Forest of the Great Apes, a spectacular lowland
rainforestof Central Africa, stretches across regions of Cameroon,
the CentralAfrican Republic, Congo Brazzaville, the Democratic
Republic of Congo,Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is second in size
only to the Amazonrainforest and is the most species-rich place in
Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has already lost two-thirds of its ancient forests in the
lastthirty years, industrial logging threatens most of what
remains. In aslittle as five to ten years Africa's apes, the
gorillas, chimpanzeesand bonobos, will disappear with the last
undisturbed forest areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European-owned timber companies are complicit in that
destruction, as &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/logging-cameroon"&gt;revealed in a new
Greenpeace Report&lt;/a&gt;. And France, by accepting timber from illegal
and destructive sources,is also jeopardizing the development of
legitimate trade in legal andenvironmentally and socially
responsible timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25613/french-timber.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004 France was the largest market in the EU for imports of
Africantropical hardwood primary products -- a market valued at
E256 million.France imports timber and timber products from
countries, such asCongo Brazzaville, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast
and the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, where corruption is rampant
and illegal logging is aserious problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of how this trade operates in Cameroon is the use
ofsuspect and illegal "salvage" logging permits. Salvage permits
weredesigned for well-defined cases in which specific development
projectsrequired the clearing of trees -- for road building or
industrialdevelopment, such as plantations. There were several
strict conditionsimposed before a salvage permit could be
allocated. A 1995 decreerequired that an environmental impact
assessment be undertaken. In 1998the maximum area for salvage
operations was fixed at 1,000 hectares,and the allocation had to be
through public auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in July 1999, the Cameroon Forestry Minister, by
decree,indefinitely suspended the allocation of all new salvage
permits, dueto the "abuses observed in their award" -- bribery,
kickbacks, waivingof environmental impact reports, and a range of
other corruptpractices. Despite the suspension and the fact that it
has never beenrescinded, the allocation of salvage permits has
continued, giving asheen of legality to a thoroughly illegal
practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies involved supply timber to traders such as
Danish-basedDLH, French traders such as Rougier, Bois des Trois
Ports and theReseau Pro distribution chain, part of the UK based
Wolseley Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Forest Campaigner, Sue Connor says: "Stolen rainforest
timber isflooding into ports in France and Europe almost daily. It
ends up onconstruction sites and is being sold in stores across
Europe. If thiscriminal activity is not stopped, the world's
rainforests look set todisappear in our lifetime, destroying the
homes of millions of forestdependent peoples, plant and animal
species, including threatenedlowland gorillas, chimpanzees and
forest elephants."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French Government has made repeated statements that it will
takeaction against illegal and destructive forest exploitation. To
datetheir action has run counter to those declarations. France
continues toopen the borders to illegal timber and to support
forest industryinvolved in illegal logging activities. This timber
is freely availableon the French and European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;Despite years of talk by EU
Governmentsthere is still no mechanism tostop the flood of illegal
and unsustainable timber into ports andstores across Europe. There
are stronger protections against piratedmusic than there are
against illegal timber: European law looks afterheavy-metal band
Mettallica's profits better than the irreplaceablehabitat of the
last forestgorillas in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling on European governments to outlaw all imports of
illegaltimber and to promote environmentally and socially
responsible forestmanagement worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Sweden closes nuclear plants over safety fears</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/sweden-nuclear-closure-040806/</url><text>
	Sweden has shut down four of its 10 nuclear plants after faults were discovered. A major fault was discovered after a serious incident at the Forsmark nuclear power station, a former director of the plant later said: "it was pure luck there wasn't a meltdown."
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/the-forsmark-nuclear-power-pla.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/the-forsmark-nuclear-power-pla.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Forsmark nuclear power plant. The plant suffered a serious safety incident and has been shut down for investigation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure of the Swedish plants has removed at a stroke
roughly 20percent of Sweden's electricity supply. Emergency power
systems to theForsmark plant failed for 20 minutes during a power
cut. If power wasnot restored there could have been a major
incident within hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former director of the Forsmark plant said, "It was pure luck
thatthere was not a meltdown. Since the electricity supply from the
networkdidn't work as it should have, it could have been a
catastrophe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the fault in the backup power systems originates
fromnew equipment installed in 1993. Not exactly reassuring that
faultyequipment, vital for preventing a meltdown, went undetected
for 13years. The same equipment now uncovered to be faulty is also
installedon other nuclear power plants in other countries. Germany
is alreadyinvestigating if the same fault affects its nuclear
plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Power cuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear industry propaganda has been saying that we need nuclear
powerto prevent future power cuts. But actually current nuclear
plants arevulnerable to power cuts. All nuclear plants need power
to controlthem. If mains power is lost, back up power is required
to control thereactor. This power is supplied by back up generators
but there havebeen many instances where these generators have been
found to be faultyor susceptible to storms or floods. This has
caused the temporaryclosures of nuclear plants in the US and
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the power to a single wind or solar farm and while they will
stopgenerating electricity for the grid at least it won't threaten
to meltdown. Nuclear power relies on old, inefficient centralised
power gridsthat are vulnerable to power cuts. Clean renewable
energy sources helpcreate more efficient decentralised power where
it is generated muchcloser to where it is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When the going gets hot, nuclear plants stop running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with Swedish nuclear plants come hot on the heels
of&lt;a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=34121"&gt;problems
with nuclear power plants in Europe&lt;/a&gt; due to the hot dry
summer.Two nuclear plants in Germany recently had to reduce output
due to thelack of sufficient water for cooling in rivers. If the
droughtcontinues many nuclear plants that rely on rivers for
cooling waterwill have to reduce output or shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Sweden plans to phase out its nuclear power plants in
thecoming years. Unfortunately a small minority of other
Europeancountries like France, Finland and the UK seem determined
to rely ondangerous, dirty and expensive nuclear power that can
fail dangerouslyduring a power cut and be shut down by
droughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent events expose industry lies about nuclear being a
reliable energy source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A combination of safe, &lt;a href="~/link/04f2817ef00b4912974faebedf5a884e.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;renewable energy and energy efficiency&lt;/a&gt; measures are the only sanesolution for power generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=swedennukes"&gt;Get our free monthly e-zine to find out how you can take part in the energy revolution, substituting safe, clean, renewables for nuclear and fossil fuels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=swedennukes"&gt;Donate and become a member today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;Update 9
December:  In a major breakthrough, the Thai National Economic and
Social Advisory Council of thePrime Minister's office  has
committed to  review theGovernment's energy policy.  We are ending
our blockade of the Map Ta Phut coal facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;"Greenpeace
considers this amajor victory for the Thai people," said Greenpeace
Southeast Asiaspokesperson Tara Buakamsri from the sit-in which had
disrupted theplant's operations today. "Thailand has a vast
potential for clean,renewable energies such as modern biomass, wind
and solar. It's time toshift government policy towards them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/asia-energy-revolution/"&gt;South
East Asian Energy Revolution campaign&lt;/a&gt;entered its third day of
activity today at one of Asia's largestcoal-fired power plants.
Activists from Thailand, the Philippines, and the United States
climbed theloading crane of the BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in
Thailand andunfurled banners demanding the plant's immediate
closure on Wednesday, calling onthe Thai government to phase out
coal power and to commit to renewableenergy.  On Thrusday they
added a camp onan electricity pylon, and on Friday blockaded the
entrance to the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the main cause of climate change in Thailand and
SoutheastAsia.  Greenpeace demands that construction on this site
bestopped and a thorough review of the Thai Government's
coal-drivenenergy plan be undertaken immediately," said Greenpeace
Southeast Asiaspokesperson Tara Buakamsri from the camp. "We will
stay here until ourdemands are met."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/banner-on-crane-at-site-of-wha.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is causing severe hardship in Thailandandacross
the Southeast Asia region, and according to Tara,  "Plants like
BLCP are the main culprits."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany earlier this week, the most polluting coal plant in
Europe provided theplatform for a simple message: "CO2 Kills."  The
owner of the plant is planning ten new brown-coal power units, one
ofwhich together with the plant we've occupied will emit more CO2
thanthe entire nation of NewZealand.  Twenty Greenpeace activists
occupied the stack for more than 60 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/RWEcoalprotestgermany.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InMontreal, 181 countries are meeting to determine what the
world isgoing to do about global warming. A key issue atthe summit
is how other countries will deal with strong pressure fromthe US to
ignore climate change.  Our message to the delegates? Ignore the US
administration. Take action. (&lt;a href="http://climate2005.greenpeace.ca/"&gt;Updates here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the United States, Japan, Germany,France, Bangladesh,
Brazil, Australia and South Africa, people took to the streetson
Saturday to demand just that. 7,000 marched onMontreal alone. Five
environmental groups including Greenpeacedelivered a petition
signed by 600,000 Americans to the US consulate inMontreal, calling
upon President Bush and the US Congress to help slowglobal
warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Greenpeace activists made clear thatthe government
won't be able to build more dirty nuclear power plantswithout a
fight, as they &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/blair-nuclear-announcement-scu/"&gt;
occupied the room in which Tony Blair planned to outline a review
of the UK's energy future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/wrong-answer.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France, Greenpeace &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-nuclear-waste-shipment/"&gt;
blocked a shipment of nuclear waste bound&lt;/a&gt;for Russia in an
action illustrating one more reason why nuclear poweris not a
solution to climate change. The waste is currently in transitalong
more than a dozen European coastlines, a terrorist target and
atelling reminder that nobody knows what to do with nuclear
waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Asia and global warming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to climate change, Asia is a place of particular
opportunity and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/videos/south-east-asia-drought"&gt;
Catastrophic droughts&lt;/a&gt; across Thailand  this year cost the
countryUS $193 million and untold human suffering. The
Thaigovernment has set a target of delivering 8% of its energy
fromrenewables by 2011, a goal which we don't believe the
government canmeet if it continues to divert funding from
renewables into coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/wind-and-sun.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewables can provide 35 percent of Thailand's energy supply
by2020; there already exists enough biomass to power 25 percent of
thecountry's electricity needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climatechange is a reality but so too are the solutions," said
Jean-FrancoisFauconnier of Greenpeace International aboard the
Rainbow Warrior. "Wind, solar and  modern biomass power are already
bigbusiness  not only in Europe but also in China. The potential
in Thailand is equally huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"International financialinstitutions like the Asian Development
Bank and the Japan Bank forInternational Cooperation  should stop
 financing coal. Theycontinuously talk up their  support for
renewables yet we've seen verylittle in the way of funds being
re-directed  towards thoseenergies. It's time for less talk and
more action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior is inBangkok on the
Thailand leg of its 10-week Asia Energy Revolution Tour,exposing
the impacts of climate change and promoting the uptake ofrenewable
energy like wind and biomass. The tour started in Australiaand will
end  in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help keep us winning more victories like this. We rely entirely on donations from people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It has been a confrontational 24 hours for the PR people at computer giant Hewlett Packard (HP) with Greenpeace activists turning up at both their headquarters in the US and China.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Few HP employees probably know that their products end up as e-waste, or that the toxic contents end up poisoning Chinese workers, many of them children.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update March 8, 2006: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/hewlettpackardHPtoxicchallenge090306"&gt;HP rises to the toxic challenge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Workers were greeted by a bright orange blimp floating above
theentrance to the HP international headquarters in California.
Hangingfrom the blimp was an image of a Chinese girl clutching an
HPkeyboard surrounded by an electronic waste (e-waste) scrapyard
with theslogan - "HP = Harmful Products".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pirate radio station broadcast a message encouraging workers
andpassers-by to contact the HP CEO Mark Hurd to demand they make
cleanerproducts. The message was also delivered by phone to around
4000employees working at the headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"HP is a prime example of a dirty electronics company," said
GreenpeaceInternational toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska.  "It has
donelittle to eliminate hazardous materials in its products, and it
islagging behind some of its competitors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in China then delivered postcards to the employees at
HPheadquarters in Beijing along with e-waste components recovered
fromthe Guiyu, e-waste dump site in the Guangdong Province of
China. Theactivists, wearing boiler suits bearing the words "HP =
HarmfulProducts," urged HP employees to work from within and call
for hazardoussubstances in computer manufacture to be phased
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/hp-usa-china-action.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace believes that most HP employees are unaware of how
theirproducts become toxic e-waste and pollute the environment in
scrappingyards like Guiyu, in China. Armed with information we
believe they willask their managers to stop manufacturing such
products" said Zhao Yangfrom Greenpeace China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some electronics companies, such as Samsung, Sony, Sony
Ericsson,Nokia, LG and Motorola have taken a first step by
committing to theelimination of all types of brominated flame
retardants and PVC plasticfrom their products on set timelines. 
HP, Acer, Apple, Dell,Fujitsu-Siemens, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, and
Toshiba have, to date,made no such commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>WTO: The real face of free trade</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/wto-the-real-face-of-free-tra/</url><text>
	A child sits in a mountain of electronic waste, covered in toxic chemicals, pulling apart components to retrieve tiny bits of metal; this is the face of free trade your government does not want you to see. As trade ministers from around the world arrive in Hong Kong for the World Trade Organization (WTO) summit, they claim that free trade is good for you. You will excuse this child if he disagrees.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            He's not reaping the benefits of "Free Trade."  He's being poisoned by what we throw away.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is not just the place where trade ministers
attendreceptions. Hong Kong is also a 'freeport' for the world's
electronicwaste. China is quickly becoming the world's trash bin.
As much as4,000 tonnes of toxic e-waste is discarded every
hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manyelectronic products are routinely, and often illegally,
shipped fromEurope, Japan and the US to China. Dumping them there
is cheaper thantaking proper care of them at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our mobile phones,computers and other electronic
products are made using toxicingredients, workers at yards such as
in Guiyu, China, risk exposurewhen they break the products apart by
hand, under appalling conditions.Guiyu is where this boy is
sitting. This is what "free trade" lookslike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle vs More, Faster, Cheaper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsat the WTO meeting aim to eliminate tariffs on
electronic goods as partof the funnily named NAMA negotiations.
NAMA stands for NonAgricultural Market Access. Most products you
see in the shops arecovered by these negotiations. Free trade in
electronic goods willresult in more electronic goods being traded.
Sadly, as long aseffective social and environmental regulations are
missing, this willlead to even more electronic waste being dumped
in scrap-yards such asGuiyu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to its preamble, the WTO exists "to protectand
preserve the environment" and to achieve "the optimal use of
theworld's resources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big words. But in reality, the WTO forcescountries to compete to
trade more. As a result, the use of naturalresources is spiralling
upwards. One fifth of global oil consumption isused just to move
goods around the world. And trade negotiatorscontinue to ignore the
environment. This is true for electronic goodsand the waste they
will inevitably become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Can't see the forest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is most shameful in the case of forests - another "product"
covered by the NAMA negotiations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheEuropean Union asked a respected university to conduct
a"sustainability impact assessment" of trade liberalization on
forests.As we long suspected, the study shows, that trade
liberalization fuelsthe destruction of the world's last remaining
ancient forests. Sadly,the researchers appear to have wasted their
time. Governments,unwilling to admit unpalatable truths, still aim
to move forward withthe NAMA negotiations in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this, Greenpeace says:STOP. Governments must halt the NAMA
negotiations. Plans forliberalization of vital environmental
assets, such as forests, must beabandoned. We must force
governments to admit the real face of freetrade and stop our waste
being dumped on children in Guiyu.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Toxic slick heads for Russia</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/toxic-slick-heads-for-russia/</url><text>
	Eighteen days after an explosion at a chemical factory in Jilin Provence launched a huge 80 kilometer (50 mile) slick of cancer-causing benzene down the Songhua River, and nine days after the Chinese government admitted to suppressing the news, activists from Greenpeace Russia are in place and awaiting the slick to slide across the border.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/the-chinese-russian-border-run.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/the-chinese-russian-border-run.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The river Amur where Chinese-Russian border runs through the centre of the river. The toxic slick of is slowly approaching large Russian cities via the frozen river.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Chinese people who rely on the Songhua for their
drinkingwater have had to rely on bottled water and emergency
supplies instead.Our activists are keeping a close eye on Russia's
Emergency Ministry,Emercom, to make sure that sampling and public
information are accurateand that no expense is spared in protecting
human health and theenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Russia nor China enjoy much of a reputation for openness
whenit comes to industrial disasters. The recent description of the
initialcover-up by Zhang Zuoji, Governor of Heilonggjiang Provence
as a"benevolent lie" has done little to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But will it be any different in the Russian Federation?
Greenpeace'sman on the ground, Alexi, says: "On paper and in their
reports they arepretty much set up to meet the slick. However, we
in the area say thatthey are under-staffed. The amount of activated
carbon -- which can beused to filter benzene from the water -- is
insufficient. Not tomention that the way they take samples -- using
a helicopter and abucket on a rope -- raises a lot of
questions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are still many unknown facts, like exactly how much
benzene andother toxic substances really spilled into the Songhau;
or how thefreezing temperatures and ice-cover on the rivers will
effect theslick; or whether or not it will still be a slick or a
more dispersedplume.  But Emercom and local scientists, probably
also to avoidpanic, are saying that the slick will not reach Russia
at all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Emercom and some local scientists believe, or hope, that
thelarger part of the slick will turn into the Chinese side of the
river,but not all of it, so they are preparing some safety
measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city of Khabarovsk on the Amur has a population of some
800,000people. Other large river cities include Amursk (about
70,000 people)and Komsomolsk-on-Amur (up to 300,000 people). There
are also manyvillages and small towns along the river. To a various
extent anddepending on the response of the Russian authorities and
influence oficing the slick may affect some 1,200,000 or so
people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the myths and rumours are already starting to build around
thenearly invisible benzene's ghostly trip down river. At the
moment it isbelieved to be passing the Chinese city of Jiamusi, a
city about twothirds of the way to the Russian border from Harbin,
the first Chinesecity to have its water supply cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Alexi, there is a dam near Khabarovsk which dampens
waterflow.  So in order to channel the polluted water away from
theKhabarovsk water supply inlets, the authorities are
considering blowing up the 400-million rouble (12-million euro)
dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, on November 25th the Khabarovsk authorities turned off
the tapwater because it was rumoured a day earlier they found
benzene in Amur.Later the authorities tried to calm the population
down explaining theturn-off was for technical reasons only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumours also abound that another pollutant heptyl had been found
in thewater. "This news was made hotter by the Emercom spokesman
who saidthat this information was closed" says Alexi. "Oleg Mitvol,
from theGovernment, who was there at the time demonstratively drank
some tapwater to show that it is safe. But, even that backfired,
people startedsaying that he had eaten lots of adsorbents
beforehand and that he didthis because he had gotten a phone call
from Moscow telling him to stopany panic even at the price of his
own health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So added to certain danger of benzene we can add the legacy of
years ofmisinformation and no information, a heady cocktail of
Governmentincompetence and intransigence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll do our best to bear witness and continue to apply pressure
forfull monitoring over the next few months and well into the
spring thaw,but also to promote honesty and independence in the
battle to provide awary public with information that they can have
confidence in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=toxspillstory"&gt;Help keep us responding rapidly to environmental emergencies.

<item><language>en</language><title>Illegal nuclear waste shipment blocked</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/illegal-nuclear-waste-shipment/</url><text>
	In a daring 2AM action, twenty Greenpeace activists have blocked the loading of illegal nuclear waste in France.  
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/radioactive-waste-is-one-more.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Radioactive waste is one more reason why nuclear power is not an answer to climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Russian freighter, the Kapitan Kuroptche, was preparing to
transportmore than 450 tons of radioactive uranium waste to Russia
when theactivists blocked cranes on the ship and the pier.  The
wasteoriginated from the Pierlatte uranium enrichment plant in the
RhoneValley. It's part of a thirty-year-old practice of dumping
nuclearwastes produced in Europe in Russia, where federal law
prohibits theimport of foreign waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;We're just putting it there for now: honest!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franceclaims the waste is going to Russia for reprocessing --
the process bywhich plutonium is separated from spent fuel -- but
in fact only asmall portion is treated.  In reality, it's simply
being put outof sight, out of mind, with no long-term solution for
what to do withit on the horizon.  Greenpeace has filed a case in
the Moscowdistrict court against the Russian government nuclear
export company,Tecksnabexport.  The nuclear industry would prefer
these shipmentshappened in secret, as they underscore a key reason
why nuclear fuel isnot a viable energy solution, and why nuclear
power is not a solutionto climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Vulnerable to attack, dangerously shipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butin addition to being illegal, the shipments are also highly
dangerous.Shipments between west European ports are regularly
transitting throughthe North Sea, Skagarak, the Baltic and the Gulf
of Finland beforearriving at St Petersburg.  The shipments are made
on general Russian-owned cargo vessels rather than purpose-built
ships,despite known hazards and risks. The transportation route
goes throughmajor cities such as St Petersburg (5 million
population) and Tomsk(0.5 million) and passes the coasts of
Belgium, the Netherlands,Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Norway and
Finland. An accidental release orterrorist attack could be
devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report from Greenpeace, "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/european-rad-secret/"&gt;
Europe's Radioactive Secret&lt;/a&gt;", details the illegal nuclear waste
trade between Europe's nuclear industry and the Russian
Federation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nuclear wastes concerned are of two types: contaminated
uraniumresulting from reprocessing at the Cogema/Areva facilities
at la Hague,Normandy; and depleted uranium (DU) from nuclear fuel
enrichment atfacilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and
the UK. Thesefacilities support the day-to-day operation of
Europe's 135 nuclearreactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update 7 Dec 2005&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ElevenGreenpeace activists braving sub-zero temperatures on
board inflatableboats blocked theRussian cargo vessel 'Kapitan
Kuroptev' near Kronshtadt, some 30 kmwest of St. Petersburg,
Russia. The Kuroptev crew used water hoses onthe activists, the
resulting ice made continued protest impossible.Once the Kuroptev
has docked in St Petersburg the 450 tons ofradioactive uranium
waste is due tobe transported by rail for over 3,000 kilometers to
nuclear sites inSiberia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The containers used to transport the uranium wastedo not meet
current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standardsand pose
a serious risk during the thousands of kilometres journey tothe
Russian dump sites, where they are illegally stored or disposed.A
large percentage of the waste is in the form of hexafluoride
crystalswhich can react violently to water leading to dispersal of
toxic gas,inhalation of which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world urgently needs toshift its energy supply to clean,
safe, renewable energy. Delegates meeting in Montreal to discuss
the implementation of theKyoto Protocol need to remember that
nuclear power is not an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Half protected from toxic chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/REACHvote111/</url><text>
	European politicians have voted on a landmark law to better regulate toxic chemicals. There was good news that the law will force the replacement of toxic chemicals with safer alternatives but pressure from polluting industry ensured many thousands of chemicals will not be tested.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monica Gibbs lives next to a chemical plant and has suffered from respiratory problems since birth. Politicians should put people's health before chemical industry profits.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote is the latest round in the progress of the new
Europeanlegislation called REACH which was originally intended to
replacecurrent ineffective laws that are failing to protect us from
toxicpollution. But almost from the moment it was suggested it has
beenunder fire from vested interests who profit from pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) resisted industry
pressurewhen they supported replacing hazardous chemicals with
saferalternatives. In the past month concerned citizens have sent
almost15,000 emails and photos to MEPs demanding protection from
chemicalpollution. But industry lobbying succeeded in convincing
MEPs toexempt thousands of chemicals from the need to provide any
health andsafety information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently about 90 percent of the thousands of chemicals in
daily usehave no or insufficient health and safety data. If the law
fails torequire basic safety information about chemicals it will
make itimpossible to systematically identify and replace the most
hazardoussubstances which is the one of the principle aims of
REACH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Round one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road from proposal to law for any European legislation is
long andwinding and REACH has taken longer than most and still has
a few roundsleft to go. Intense industry lobbying has helped delay
and weaken theproposal and it will next be discussed by national
governments.Hopefully national governments will stand up for their
people andstrengthen the proposal rather than weaken it further in
favour ofpolluting industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be campaigning hard to pressure the national governments
to takedecisive action on toxic pollution and not cave into
pressure comingfrom the German government that is trying to wreak
the proposal tofavour its large chemical industry lobby. Recently
we have behighlighting the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxicbarrosoverheugenreach111/"&gt;
top Brussels politicians&lt;/a&gt; who are doing the bidding ofpolluting
chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rest of the world?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intricacies of European law makingcan seem somewhat
mundane and remote, this proposed law has farreaching consequences.
As the world's largest market for chemicals newlaw in Europe will
set a global standard for the regulation ofchemicals. The chemical
industry knows that this could cut theirpolluting practices and
have spent millions lobbying against it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;This is a unique opportunity toprotect us and the environment and it should not be sacrificed for theshort-sighted interests of the large chemicals producers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

            Rainbow Warrior under sail.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our ship Rainbow Warrior was in the Philippines, documenting
thepotential impacts of global warming on coral reefs in a World
Heritagesite.  We were operating with a government chart which
claimed tobe up to date, but showed us to be 1.5 miles away from
the reef we hitaround 7am local time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This incident is very regrettable.  Within minutes after
ithappened, we called up the marine park ranger station to inform
themabout the accident," said Red Constantino of Greenpeace
Southeast Asia.Marine park rangers, assisted by Greenpeace,
immediately conducted anassessment of the damaged reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park officials' final assessment of damage covered a total
area of 32 meters by 3 meters (105 x 10 feet) of the reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine was set at 384,000 pesos (US$6,857).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This accident could have been avoided if the chart was
accurate. We feel responsible, however, and this amount will be
transferred onWednesday 2 November," said Constantino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grounding did not cause any major damage to the ship nor
serious delays to the ship's expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

toget the full assessment of the damage," said Tubbataha Park

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Tubbataha Protected Area Management board
bothagreed there is a serious need of updated maps and precise
maritimecharts of the Tubbataha Reefs to avoid similar
accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition to the Tubbataha Reefs is part of the global

<item><language>en</language><title>Swimming in chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/toxicpollutioneels111/</url><text>
	The European eel - not an everyday topic of conversation. But our investigations have revealed that the humble eel is contaminated with toxic chemicals. Adding insult to injury, the eel is already vanishing from lakes and rivers across Europe, and some of these toxic chemicals look as if they might last longer than the species itself.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/europeaneelpollution.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The European Eel. Stocks in Europe have crashed due to a combination of overfishing, habitat loss and toxic pollution. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do toxic chemicals with complicated names like brominated
flameretardants (BFRs) that are added to many textiles, sofas,
plastics,TV's and computers end up in eels? Politicians tell us
that chemicalsare under control, but tell that to an eel who is
swimming inchemicals. Toxic chemicals are out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this contamination a problem for eels? No one knows for sure
but theevidence is mounting that BFRs and other toxics have the
potential todamage development and hormone systems in humans and
wildlife.Certainly for an eel already under pressure, it's an extra
dose of bad news.Some scientists are concerned that these toxins
could harm the eel'sability reproduce or its young to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With populations in some European waters as low as 1 percent
ofhistoric levels, the eel clearly doesn't need a toxic burden. For
thatmatter neither do we. BFRs can also contaminate our own
blood,including umbilical cord blood, exposing an unborn baby to
manmadehazardous chemicals while still in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical contamination? No Thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/10/virtual-gallery-banner.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;We need your help to counter dirty industry lobbying against laws to protect you from toxic pollution. Take a stand by &lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;uploading your picture&lt;/a&gt; at the vote for safer chemicals site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe a new law (called REACH) is being drafted that
attempts toprotect human health and the environment from the toxic
contamination.REACH would provide health and safety information
currently lacking forsome 30,000 chemicals. A strong REACH would
drive the replacement orsubstitution of toxic chemicals with safer
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while eels might be slippery and tricky to control they
havenothing on the worst excesses of the chemical industry. The
vitalproposed law has inspired the biggest industrial
lobbyingassault ever seen in Europe. The chemical industry is
seeking to weakenit to the benefit of industry and loss of
protection for you and me.Chemical industry associations from
Europe, US and Asia have sentarmies of lobbyists to Brussels,
spreading baseless scare stories andemploying delay tactics with
any politician would listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Don't worry - we'll just test a few"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some EU politicians and governments are now pushing the industry
line,wrongly claiming the law will cost jobs and must be
"streamlined," mademore "cost effective" and "workable." These are
industry weasel wordsfor the seriously weakening the law to
everyone else. They proposeallowing industry to continue using
20,000 chemicals without basichealth, safety and environmental data
information - that's 2/3 of thechemicals originally under the
law!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the chemical industry and certain politicians prefer
toignore past experiences with toxic chemicals. Here again the eel
cangive them a little lesson - in history. Many eels tested had
highlevels of highly toxic PCB's - despite the fact they have been
bannedsince the 1970's in Europe. Past mistakes in chemical
regulationare not quickly resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Protecting people or pandering to profit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The politicians of the European Union have a unique opportunity
toeffective regulate chemical pollution and set a strong
worldwideprecedent to protect human health and the environment.
Will they standup for the people who elected them or will they cave
to in to vestedinterests of the non-elected chemical industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action against toxic pollution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;We need your voice for safer chemicals to show politicians the need to put the public before dirty industry profits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=167_105"&gt;Help our work for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s that time of the year again, the six ships of the whaling fleet are leaving Japan and heading back to the culling ground, the “Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,” to carry out “scientific testing” on 1000 whales. The “scientific test” involves harpooning the whale, measuring and weighing the carcass, slicing and dicing, and finally delivering it to markets, boxed and frozen.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            SOUTHERN JAPAN The whaling ship Nisshin-maru  departs from Aruka port, Shimonoseki, Southern Japan together with a fleet of four catcher ships bound for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with the intention of killing 1,000 whales. Greenpeace called upon the Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) and the companies behind the whaling to immediately recall the fleet and cancel the cull.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TheInternational Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial
whaling in 1986. TheSouthern Ocean was declared a Whale Sanctuary
in 1994. Yetevery year  the Fisheries Agency ofJapan (FAJ) sends
the fleet of whalers back to the Southern Ocean via aloophole in
international law. The IWC has said it does not need thedata
produced by the 'research' and strongly urges Japan to call itoff.
The scale of the hunt leads only to one conclusion, that this
iscommercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sanctuary means refuge or safe haven, yet this year nearly
1,000whales will receive neither from the whaler's harpoon," warned
JohnFrizell of Greenpeace International. "The Sanctuary is there to
helpwhales recover after over a century of relentless persecution
sentpopulations plummeting. Japan should join all other countries
inrespecting the Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the FAJ announced at the annual meeting of
the IWCits intention to more than double its "scientific" cull to
935 minkewhales and to add 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales
over the nexttwo years. Both humpback and fin whales are listed as
endangeredspecies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan claims, "according to Japanese
culturalvalues… whales are viewed as a food source." However, an
opinion pollcommissioned in 2002 by the influential Japanese Asahi
newspaper foundthat only four percent of the Japanese population
regularly eat whalemeat nine percent rarely eat it; 53 percent
haven't eaten it sincechildhood and 33 percent have never eaten
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In reality few Japanese people view whale meat as a vital food
sourceand even fewer actually eat it. It is simply not true that
whaling isimportant to the Japanese public and the whaling fleet
should not leavefor the Antarctic whale sanctuary," said Mizuki
Takana of GreenpeaceJapan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAJ also claims that whales are contributing to the collapse
offish stocks. "Ninety nine per cent of the catch will be Southern
Oceanminke whales which eat krill and not fish. Only the newly
addedendangered Fin and Humpback whales eat fish," said John
Frizell, Oceanscampaigner at Greenpeace. "Are we really saying that
we cannot spare afew fish for endangered whales?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=WhaleScience"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and help stop whaling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=96_102"&gt;Help Greenpeace defend our oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or the UK? Sick of this hypocrisy, armies of Bombspotters have descended on Belgium to conduct their own "citizen inspections".  At least these weapons of mass destruction can easily be found, in no less than six European countries.

            Greenpeace activists attempt a citizens' inspection of NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our activists joined with regular Bombspotting activists to
inspectthree military facilities in Belgium, with the aim of
pressuring NATOmember states to renounce their nuclear weapons
arsenal.  Theinspections took place at Kleine Brogel Air base which
houses nuclearweapons, NATO's Brussels Headquarters and its SHAPE
militaryheadquarters in Mons/Bergen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike UN Weapons Inspectors, who seem to take a subtle approach
toweapons-inspection attire, our activists dressed as 'walking
missiles',with "NUCLEAR FREE NATO" emblazoned across them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six European countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Turkey,
Italyand UK) currently have an estimated 480 American air-launched
nuclearbombs based on their territories.   Isn't this a
bithypocritical?  Our nuclear campaigner Nicky Davies thinksso. 
"At a time when NATO members are urging countries like Iranto
abandon their nuclear ambitions, we have the hypocritical
situationin which non-nuclear NATO states play host to US weapons,"
she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be growing political and public unease amongst a
numberof European countries towards hosting US nuclear weapons,
with Belgiumamong them. These citizen weapons inspections have
grown out of thisfrustration at the continued secrecy of nuclear
weapon states.Interestingly, the Bombspotters are actually
upholding InternationalLaw, which declares the "threat and use" of
all nuclear weapons to beillegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are calling on NATO to disarm and become anuclear-free
alliance asa first step towards the global abolition of nuclear
weapons," saidNicky, from among the walking bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

	If you wanted a census of wild birds, would you get a slingshot and kill them to count them? This is practically what the Government of Japan is proposing, yet again. Wire reports reveal that a secret proposal from Japan's Fisheries Agency sets a "scientific" quota of double the current take of minke whales. They also want to add endangered humpback and fin whales. It's time for killing in the name of science to stop.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/japanese-workers-flense-a-whal.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japanese workers flense a whale on the deck of a factory ship Nisshin Maru in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans by the Government of Japan to 'sharply' increase its take
ofminke whales, and to resume catching both fin and humpback whales
underthe guise of scientific research, are a deadly slap in the
face for theinternational community, making a mockery of the
International Whaling Commission (IWC) and internationalefforts to
control whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret proposal from Japan, which has been submitted
forconsideration at the IWC meeting beginning on May 27 in Ulsan,
Korea,will see new "scientific" quotas with a minke whale take of
880 in theAntarctic in addition to a catch of some 10 humpback and
fin whales.Let's just remember here that populations of whales in
the Antarcticare at only 10 percent of what they were before
industrial whaling - itseems ludicrous to kill them to count
them,or find out what they eat. Then again, it's not so ludicrous
if you're going to makemillions from the meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the Fisheries' Agency's "research" whalers reported
revenuesof over US$50 million from a catch of 700 whales. Their
catch this yearis expected to be 1,300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our resident whale expert, John Frizell, said "For too long the
'scientific' loophole has provided commercial whalerswith a 'fig
leaf' of respectability. The IWC should move to end thescandal of
scientific whaling and end the scientific exemption."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submission to the IWC by Japan's Fisheries Agency is
designated "inconfidence". But since when was the science of
environmental protectionand nature conservation best served by
secrecy? If it's so scientific,why are they trying to hide it? Why
not post it on the internet so theworld wide community of whale
researchers can review it.  Ifthey're really stuck, perhaps the
public could then suggest ways to dothe studies non-lethally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific whaling loophole isn't the only problem plaguing
theIWC's efforts. Over the last month the Rainbow Warrior has been
inKorea to highlight another flaw in international efforts to ban
thehunting of whales. In 2003 the Korean fishing fleet
"accidentally"netted 84 whales, which were legally traded and
processed for domesticconsumption. Korean Government statistics
show that between ten and ahundred times more whales are
"accidentally" caught in Korea than incountries that do not have a
domestic whale meat market (Japan has asimiliarly high rate of
"accidental" catches, otherwise known asbycatch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse for these whales: scientists believe that the
Koreanpopulation of minke whales is in serious decline. Research
published bythe well-respected Royal Society shows not only that
minke whales inJapanese and Korean waters are declining; but that
they will continueto decline even if hunting does not resume, due
to these high levels of"accidental" bycatch - and the IWC
scientists agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also been revealed that Korea is, again on the quiet,
proposingto build a whale processing factory in the very city where
the IWC isto be held, which could be indicative that, like Japan,
they intend topursue whaling and brand it "science".&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The grid beneath</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/wind_grid/</url><text>
	Even without an advanced degree, you can admire the technology behind offshore wind farms - the underwater construction, the towers, the turbines, the elegant physics of the whole thing.  That these spinning blades can power homes, factories and whole cities is, well, pretty cool.  This is easy to see. Obvious.  What people rarely ever think about is how all that electricity gets back to shore.  Enter the humble power grid.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/11/the-uk-s-first-wind-farm-in-th-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/11/the-uk-s-first-wind-farm-in-th-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The UK's first wind farm in the Irish Sea which will supply 50,000 homes with power.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughtabout or not, power grids take years to build -
especially across theocean floor. It's not like you can make do
with a few kilometers ofextension cord and duct tape. There are,
first off, the technicalchallenges. Salt water is not the best for
electrical components, so itwill have to be kept out despite
hundreds of kilos of water pressure.Then there are the distances
involved, and the various environmentalconsiderations - the effects
of electro-magnetic fields, noise andconstruction on marine
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most of these challenges already have solutions
gainedfrom experience with existing wind farm instillations. No
doubt a lotof hard work and cleverness will still be needed, but
the technologiesinvolved are proven enough that, from an
engineering perspective, thereis every reason to expect success at
sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's on shore that the real troubles begin - troubles that are
morepolitical, institutional and bureaucratic than technical. On
land thepower grid has often been built by existing old guard
companies thathave their own power plants (coal, nuclear, etc.),
and aren't keenabout competition from the emerging wind industry.
Of course, theexisting grids are mostly optimized for the benefit
of these old guardpower companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simplistically: Starting at the power plants, big
electriccable trunks branch out to smaller and smaller cables that
carry asmaller and smaller amount of power. Another way to picture
it is tolook at how thick the cable running into your home is.
Compare this tothe much smaller wires going to individual
appliances (like a lamp ormicrowave). It's sort of like water
pipes, big ones branch out tolittle ones, and the one that goes to
your tap is a lot smaller thenthe one going into your house from
the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, you can see how it doesn't work to take a
big1000-megawatt cable, supplying electricity from a wind farm, and
plugit into a much smaller regular street cable. But odds are that
wherethe cable from a wind farm comes to shore is at the edge of
the landgrid - where there are only regular street cables serving
residentialneeds. Therefore, new trunk cables, and other grid
infrastructure,needs to be added to accommodate the wind farm. This
is not a seriousengineering problem, and is done all the time when
a power plant isbuilt someplace new. Of course, the old guard power
companies resistchanges to "their" power grid that will let the
wind industry compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if these entrenched forces can be overcome, offshore wind
has hugepotential. Although it's comparatively small now, the wind
industry isalready growing despite these odds (by 20 percent last
year), andfuture payoffs are going to be huge. For example, with
gridmodernization by 2020 offshore wind power could be supplying
enoughenergy to the European Union for every single one of its 150
millionhouseholds. And, naturally, the EU doesn't have a monopoly
on wind -vast potential exists around the world - but without the
humble powergrid it goes nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory: Cogema guilty of illegal nuclear waste</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-cogema-guilty/</url><text>
	After four years of appeals, the La Hague nuclear plant can now truly be called a nuclear dump - and an illegal one at that. French energy giant Cogema has been ordered to sort out their spent nuclear fuel rods, or end up paying Greenpeace 1500 euros a day.  
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/greenpeace-activists-spend-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/greenpeace-activists-spend-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists spend the night waiting for the imminent arrival of two nuclear fuel ships from the US to France.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cogema, a subsidiary of the huge French energy company Areva,
has beenillegally importing and storing Australian nuclear waste
for the lastfour years. As we tried to tell them way back in 2001,
this storage is asource of environmental damage.  Four years of
legal wranglinglater, Cogema has now been ordered to pay 10,000
Euros in damages toGreenpeace. "10,000 euros?" you might think. 
"Surely that'speanuts to Cogema!"  True - but it's the
repercussions of thisdecision that could really make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, so far the nuclear industry has been able to get away
withthe very strange idea that spent nuclear fuel does not
constitutenuclear waste.  The admission that the nuclear waste
involved inthis case is now admitted to actually be... well,
nuclear waste, meansthe whole French policy of waste management  is
now at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a major victory," explains Yannick Rousselet, our
Frenchnuclear campaigner. "This decision confirms what we have
always said:Cogema is illegally importing nuclear waste on French
soil. Thisdecision applies today to the Australian waste, but many
other types ofwaste are in the same situation, which means the La
Hague plant can nowtruly be called a nuclear dump!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court of appeal also ordered Areva to produce an
operatingauthorisation for the reprocessing of the Australian waste
within threemonths. After this deadline, Cogema will be given two
months to removethe waste from France, or pay the unexpected
penalty of paying Greenpeace 1500 euros perday.  This decision
casts doubt on the fate of all the nuclearwaste stored by Areva,
and will hopefully pave the way for more responsibility on the part
of the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Scandal: Greenpeace discovers illegal GE rice in China</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/scandal-greenpeace-exposes-il/</url><text>
	In a startling development that may have repercussions on exports of China's biggest crop, Greenpeace has uncovered genetically engineered (GE) rice, unapproved for human consumption, that appears to have been planted and sold illegally in China for the last two years.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/4/farmer-selling-ge-contaminated.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/4/farmer-selling-ge-contaminated.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Farmer selling GE contaminated rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has not authorised GE Rice forcommercial
planting, and has to date permitted only field
testing.Nevertheless, it appears GE Rice is being sold, planted,
consumed, andpossibly exported in China, one of the largest
exporters of Rice. Manyof the markets to which China sends its rice
demand GE-free grain, andthe contamination could negatively impact
China's rice sales,particularly in Japan, Korea, Russia, and the
European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nocountry in the world has commercially released GE rice. In the
US,despite widespread plantings of GE maize (corn) and soy, no
commercialGE rice crops have been planted for fear of consumer and
marketrejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Whistle blowers: local farmers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="68862" mode="story" caption="China's future depends on rice."&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localfarmers tipped off our investigators that GE rice was being
soldwithout government approval several months ago, when
Greenpeaceconducted its &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/the-yunnan-experience/"&gt;
Rice for Life tour&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequentinvestigations by our team found samples of rice seed
and unmilled andmilled rice containing GE strains. We collected
evidence from seedcompanies, agriculture extension stations,
farmers, rice millers,wholesalers and retailers. We tested our
results with the internationallaboratory GeneScan, which confirmed
the presence of transgenic DNA in19 samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the samples tested positive as Bt rice - aform which has
been genetically engineered to produce an inbuiltpesticide. For
years, large-scale field trials with Bt rice have beenconducted by
scientists of the Huazhong Agriculture University inWuhan, the
provincial capital of Hubei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="118903"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thearea borders dangerously close to what's called the "centre
forbiodiversity" of rice -- the place where the natural evolution
of wildand cultivated rice is at its most active, producing the
greatestnumber of varieties and variations from generation to
generation. Anycontamination of the wild rice species there could
alter natural riceevolution irrevocably and with impacts that may
not be understood forgenerations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Why is this dangerous? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEinsect resistant Bt rice has not been approved for cultivation
anywherein the world. There is no publicly available environmental
assessmentnor human food safety assessment available for any GE Bt
rice. However,studies from other GE Bt crops such as maize and
cotton give strongindications that Bt rice will have serious
environmental consequencesand there are serious human food safety
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="118899"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Food safety risks:&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;- Rice is the most important staple food crop in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- On average, rice provides 30% of calorie and 19% of protein
intake in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- One of the toxins produced in Bt rice (and which was found
intwo of the samples) could cause allergenic reactions in humans.
It hasalready been demonstrated to do so in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The human food safety of Bt GE rice is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Environmental risks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Non-target species such as butterflies and moths may be
adversely affected;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Weeds could pick up the pesticide production capabilities via
crossbreeding ;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Insects resistant to the introduced toxin may evolve and
require more intensive chemical control;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Contamination of natural genetic resources;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Bt rice could also affect long-term soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Rice is life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="118555" mode="story"&gt;
&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theillegal GE rice scandal comes at a time when the Chinese
government isevaluating the environmental and health safety of
various GE rice linesfor potential commercial approval. The illegal
release of GE rice intothe food chain prior to approval underscores
the weakness of theregulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those weaknesses are not limited to China.In March multinational
GE conglomerate Syngenta admitted that theymistakenly sold hundreds
of tonnes of illegal unapproved GE maize inthe United States over
the past four years. Regulators hadn't noticed.Another GE
contamination case in the USA in 2001 resulted in a $1billion
product recall amid concerns of potential allergenic reactionsafter
illegal, GE corn (Starlink) entered the human food chain. And
inMexico in 2002, a centre of biodiversity for maize, testing of
22varieties revealed genetic contamination in 15 of them, despite
agovernment ban on GE planting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace should not have to bemonitoring the GE industry's
compliance with regulations, and the GEindustry is clearly
incapable of regulating itself.  The Chinesegovernment shouldn't
have to worry that GE approved for testing isgetting out into the
environment by accident, or that scientists whoare told not to
release unapproved GE strains will do what they aretold.  But the
only way to ensure this is to simply keep GE out ofthe country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling for an urgent, international product recall of
all the GE Rice in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"TheGE industry is out of control," says our campaigner Sze
PangCheung.  "A small group of rogue scientists have taken the
world'smost important staple food crop into their own hands and are
subjectingthe Chinese public to a totally unacceptable
experiment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We'recalling on the Chinese Government to take urgent action to
recall theunapproved GE rice from the fields and from the food
chain, and toconduct an immediate inquiry into the source of the
contamination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up for action alerts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Get regular updates on ways you can campaign with us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Become a financial supporter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, instead of having this team buy a room full
ofsupercomputers they want to borrow some time on your computer --
timeyou aren't even using. By having thousands of people donate
computertime they hope to run thousands of simulations. This has
never beendone before and will lead to a greater understanding of
our climate.You'll still be able to run all your normal computer

        &lt;p&gt;
            GM maize: a dangerous experiment
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syngenta distributed an unauthorised insect resistant maize
Bt10,instead of the GE maize Bt11, which is approved in a number
ofcountries around the world. The discovery happened late in 2004,
butinstead of informing farmers and consumers straight away,
Syngentaentered into secret talks with the US government over how
they shouldtell the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to article in Nature, US regulators only
consideredwhether the Bt10 maize was safe for human consumption in
late 2004,after the contamination was reported to the US
government. This meansthat for four years, consumers eating
products containing GE corn maywell have eaten some Bt10 -
completely untested for environmental orfood safety. Even now, it's
not clear what food safety testing, if any,was actually done on
Bt10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the latest in a long series of contamination events
anddemonstrates once again that GE crops can't be controlled, even
by thecompanies that develop them" said Doreen Stabinsky, GE
campaigner. "Thelong time that this contamination took to be
discovered shows the lackof adequate checks made by the industry
and the complete absence ofadequate controls by the US government.
Even more worrying is thesecrecy and delay in making this known to
the public, who are theunwitting consumers of GE products with no
safety testing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unauthorized strain of GE maize could have been grown
inseveral other countries, such as Argentina, South Africa and
Uruguay,where Bt11 is approved for cultivation. Syngenta has until
now refusedto reveal what other countries may have received
contaminated seed.Equally unknown are the countries that
unwittingly received exports ofthe unapproved maize from the United
States, the volume of contaminatedmaize that might have been
exported, and the extent of contamination inmanufactured food
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE corn could be in many products worldwide, and
henceall products that may contain Bt10 maize should be taken from
shopshelves and all fields growing GE maize that may be
contaminated withBt10 should be destroyed, with compensation
provided to farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;Stabinsky stated "The US
government'srole in this GE contamination cannot be overlooked.
Whilst trying toforce countries worldwide to accept GMOs they
continue to preside overcase after case of illegal and dangerous GE
contamination. When this isthe model of GMO regulation that the US
is trying to force upon othercountries - by its WTO case against
the EU and by its constantinterference in the Biosafety Protocol
negotiations - then the USGovernment should not be surprised when
the reaction of the rest of theworld is to tell them to get their
own house in order, and to stopspreading genetic contamination all
over the planet."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Saving whales in Korea</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/korean-whales/</url><text>
	Our flagship Rainbow Warrior has just arrived in Incheon Harbour for the start of a month-long tour to protect whales in Korea. We've joined forces with Korea's largest environmental group, Korean Federation for the Environment Movement (KFEM) to highlight the urgent need to protect our whales and the oceans that they inhabit.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/3/greenpeace-and-korean-environm.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/3/greenpeace-and-korean-environm.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace and Korean environmental group KFEM have joined forces to save whales in Korea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;KFEM has recently launched its own domestic campaign to oppose
allforms of whaling, and its 52 local offices are busy working to
raiseawareness on the issues that surround the plight of whales and
otherocean life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, we aim to jointly inform the Korean public and
governmentthat whales in Korean waters are some of the most
threatened in theworld and, like all whales, are in need of urgent
protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="77390" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;TheRainbow
Warrior was greeted by an incredible spectacle: a percussionband, a
Buddhist monk, Korean Environment Minister Mr Kwak Kyeoul Ho,Korean
women in traditional dress who danced a welcome and children
whopresented the crew with "I love whales" t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Korea has no official whaling programme, if a whale or
dolphinis found dead in a fishing net, it can be sold on the open
market forhuge prices - in 2004 the average price paid for a mature
minke whalewas US$100 000. It is perhaps no coincidence therefore,
that Korea hassome of the highest cetacean bycatch incidents in the
world, secondonly to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="77393" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Twomarine
biologists aboard the Rainbow Warrior will conduct a whalesurvey
from Incheon to the southern island of Cheju, to document
thedecline in whale populations and sound a warning bell against a
returnto commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also aboard will be Greenpeace cyberactivist Yewon Kim, a member
ofour online community who has volunteered to keep a weblog aboard
theship to relate her experience in Korean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not commonly known in Korea that whales are under threat
orthat they are anything other than 'big fish.' It is vital that we
raiseawareness before this year's International Whaling Commission
meeting,scheduled to take place in Ulsan, an old whaling port in
the southeast.The meeting is already being widely publicized in
Korea with billboardadvertisements across Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="77396" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;TheInternational
Whaling Commission voted in 1985 to place a moratorium oncommercial
whaling. That moratorium has been under concerted attack byJapan
and other whaling nations for several years now. Votes for
andagainst the moratorium are neck and neck. If Korea sides with
thewhaling lobby this year, as it has done in the past, it could
mean theresumption of whaling worldwide. We are calling for the
Koreangovernment to 'vote for whales, not whaling' at the IWC in
June, and bydoing so, send out a clear message to the world that
they are seriousabout the protecting the whales and the health of
the oceans that theyinhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean waters were traditionally home to dolphins,
finlessporpoises, humpback whales, orcas, minkes and the Western
Pacific or'Korean' Gray whales - the most endangered whale species
in the world,whose population numbers only 100 of which only 25 are
reproductivefemales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="77387" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Thereare
also many in Korea, especially in the southeast, who would like
tosee a return to whaling, and with a whale processing
infrastructure andappetite for whalemeat already in place, the
Korean government couldconceivably announce a plan to take up
'scientific' whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a loophole in International Whaling Commission rules,
thekilling of whales for research purposes is allowed, and Japan,
Norway,and Iceland currently use 'scientific' whaling programmes to
producewhalemeat in commercial quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, we'll be providing more information
andaction opportunities by which you can help ensure Korea doesn't
returnto whaling. Our campaigners, crew, marine biologists, and
cyberactivistYewon Kim will be keeping &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/koreawhales"&gt;a weblog of their
experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Copy paper giant Xerox has announced that it will stop using fibre from Sámi Reindeer Forests in northern Finland. This is a small but significant victory in the campaign to save some of the last ancient forest in Europe.
&lt;div&gt;

            Ancient forest threatened by industrial logging to make cheap copy paper and magazines.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indigenous Sámi peoples still practice traditional reindeer
herdingin Arctic Lapland, relying on remaining old-growth forests
to providevital food for their reindeer during the cold winter
months. But theirforest is being industrially logged for the
production of pulp andpaper - ending up as magazine and copy paper
throughout Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Xerox's announcement is good news for Finland's
ancientforests. In fact it should be good news for many forests if
Xerox keepsits word. As part of our ongoing correspondence, Xerox
has informed usof the adoption of a new procurement policy,
ensuring that suppliers donot source timber from 'old-growth
forests, conservation areas or otherareas designated for
protection'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Under siege&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Finnish reindeer forest is still under siege as many othercompanies
are profiting from the destruction. The Finnish state
loggingcompany logs supposedly protected areas. Most of these logs
go toFinland's largest paper company StoraEnso to be turned into
paper andsold as magazines and copy paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up in the frozen north, we have our Forest Rescue Station to
helpdefend the rights of the Sámi peoples against industrial
logging. Wehave been helping mark their lands as protected for
reindeer herding.We are pressuring the Finnish government to stop
logging in protectedareas. We are asking StoraEnso to stop
profiting from the destructionand writing to ask StoraEnso
customers to pressure the company. Xeroxhas been one of the first
to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Help save the Reindeer forests!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't do this alone - we need your help. We are still here
inArctic Lapland working with the Sámi reindeer herders to ensure
thatthe Finnish paper industry doesn't sell out these forests to
make cheapmagazine and copy paper products. Help us defend these
forests frombeing logged by the Finnish government's own logging
company,Metsähallitus and sold for pulp and paper production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1700&amp;amp;s=FRS"&gt;StoraEnso
and the Ministry of Finance&lt;/a&gt;,who are the largest single

international pressure and ministers arecomplaining about getting

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A loader sits atop a portion of the outward bound shipment onboard the ship MV Ardhianto as it is being loaded with a large consignment of plywood from some of the world’s most endangered forests, the Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forest crime patrol came across the ship just as newly
released maps reveal that most of the last areas of ancient forest
in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia have already been given to
logging companies. The new map shows that 24 percent of Papua's
forests and as much 46 percent of Papua New Guinea's (PNG) forests
have already been sold as concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of days a massive 9,000 cubic metres of
plywood from the Henrison Iriana mill, a subsidiary of one of
Indonesia's largest logging companies, Kayu Lapis Indonesia (KLI)
will be loaded onto two ships. The timber is bound for markets in
Asia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have discovered that KLI's Henrison Iriana mill in Sorong in
Indonesia received timber from potentially illegal sources in
recent years. These sources supplied 70 percent of the mill's
timber in 2004. The latest maps back up the findings of the crime
patrol showing that much of the last ancient forests of Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea are destined for the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Millions of hectares of forest to be destroyed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2005, the Indonesian government had granted
logging concessions on 11.6 million hectares of forests in Papua
province to 65 logging companies. Closer scrutiny of the
concessions revealed that these 65 companies are actually owned by
only a few national and multinational logging companies such
as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kayu Lapis Indonesia (Indonesia)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Korindo Group (Korea, Indonesia)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Barito Pacific (UK, Indonesia)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Djajanti Group (Indonesia)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;PT Hanurata (Indonesia)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;PT Wapoga Mutiara Timber  (subsidiary of Rimbunan Hijau,
Malaysia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, our investigations documented serious violations of
forestry regulations by a logging subsidiary of KLI, operating an
industrial logging concession near the Henrison Iriana mill in
Papua. This is KLI's largest concession in Indonesia and is a major
supplier to the mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company must provide proof that all timber entering its
mills is from legal, well-managed sources and to provide documents
that show exactly where the timber came from to ensure they are not
from the last intact forest areas of the Paradise forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;Already, much of the large, intact forests in
the Paradise Forests have already been cut down - 72 percent in
Indonesia and 60 percent in PNG. The new maps released by
Greenpeace and Forest Watch Indonesia showthat as much as &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;35 percent (29 million hectares) of what is left&lt;/span&gt; of
New Guinea Island's rainforest have already beengiven away as
concessions to logging companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revelation comes just weeks after we released &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/our-disappearing-forests/"&gt;
groundbreaking satellite maps&lt;/a&gt; which reveal that the world's
forests are in critical condition. The maps provide evidence that
less than 10 percent of the Earth's land area remains as large
intact forest areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papua province is home to the Paradise Forests largest undamaged
forests but logging companies, like KLI, are destroying them at an
unprecedented rate. At least 76 percent of logging in Indonesia,
including in Papua province, is illegal. The stolen timber is
likely to end up on the shelves of timber retailers in Japan,
Europe, or the US as cheap Meranti or Lauan plywood.&lt;/p&gt;

	We're on the tail of a huge cargo ship full of stolen fish heading to the Spanish port of Las Palmas. The fish, taken from the waters of one of Africa's poorest countries - Guinea Conakry - is bound for the plates of European consumers. Ships supporting pirate fishing should not be allowed entry to European ports. So Spain, are you going to let this happen?

        &lt;p&gt;
            Fishing boats "Lian Run 24" and "Lian Run 29" illegally transfer boxes of frozen fish onto the "Binar 4" Cargo ship.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the Environmental Justice Foundation, we have
beenpatrolling and documenting the activities of fishing boats in
thewaters surrounding Guinea Conakry. What we've found is
certainlyconfusing, and that's just the way the pirates want it to
be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inthe past few weeks we have begun to unravel the web of deceit
aroundpirate fishing," said campaigner Sarah Duthie, from on board
theEsperanza. "The way the legal and illegal ships work together
isdesigned to deceive, but in the end it is a simple case of
stealingfood from others."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the &lt;em&gt;Binar 4&lt;/em&gt; being loaded with fish boxes from
two Chinese fishing vessels - &lt;em&gt;Lian Run 24&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lian Run
27&lt;/em&gt;. Two more, the &lt;em&gt;Lian Run 28&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;Lian Run
29&lt;/em&gt; were standing by, waiting to unload their catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confused? That's exactly what the pirateswant!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;object codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=5,0,0,0" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="510" width="430"&gt;  &lt;param value="/international/PageFiles/25565/pirateWeb.swf" name="movie"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allfour trawlers have been fishing in Guinea - so transferring
theircatch (transshipping) in international waters is illegal. The
only placewheretransshipping of Guinean-caught fish is legal is in
the port ofConakry. Allfour of these Lian Run boats are licensed to
fish in thewaters of Guinea andwe've documented three of the four
doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of our helicopter provoked a dramaticreaction -
it was like a cat amongst pigeons. The crews dashed aroundthe decks
closing hatches, disengaging the crane hook about to transfera load
of fish awaiting transfer, and releasing the lines securing the
ships to oneanother. With in half an hour, &lt;em&gt;Binar 4&lt;/em&gt; was
heading north, while the trawlers headed back into Guinean
waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Talk about acting suspiciously!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thisisn't an isolated case - during the Esperanza's patrol off
the coast ofWest Africa, we documented 104 foreign flagged vessels,
from Korea,China, Italy, Liberia and Belize. We gathered evidence
suggesting thataround 50 percent of the ships were involved in, or
least linked toillegal fishing activities. This includes fishing
without a license,operating with no name or hiding their identity,
trawling inside the12-mile zone restricted to local fishermen, or
transshipping anywhereother than the Guinean capital Conakry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made radio contact as the &lt;em&gt;Binar 4&lt;/em&gt;steamed north. They
told us they were heading to Las Palmas and hadbeen in
international waters to tranship because they were "worriedabout
the army in Guinea Conakry". They had &lt;strong&gt;10,000 boxes of fish
on board - and weren't full!&lt;/strong&gt;Apparently their dramatic
departure was due to having "just got a callfrom Las Palmas" saying
that that they needed to go there... What acoincidence!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	An exposé by respected insider journalist Seymour Hersh reveals that  the US is considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons against Iran. But where would those weapons come from, and where would they strike? Those questions bear deep implications for NATO and innocent civilians in Iran.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under something known as ‘nuclear burden sharing’ there arecurrently some &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;480 US/NATO nuclear bombs spread across six countries:the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UScould decide to use any or all of these without consulting the hostcountries governments, or people, to use against Iran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/nuclear/disarmament/us-nuclear-warplans-against-ir"&gt;&lt;span class="Box green" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Take Action: Tell NATO to stay out of nuking Iran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hersh writes &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060417fa_fact" target="_blank"&gt;in the New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;that "Air Force planning groups are drawing up lists of targets andteams of American combat troops have been ordered into Iran under coverto collect targeting data and to establish contact with anti-governmentethnic-minority groups..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a set of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;likely striketargets&lt;/span&gt; might look like, drawn from publicly available information.Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) made an analysis of likelycasualties using the US Department of Defense's own methodology andconcluded there would be around&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; 3 million immediate deaths&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/iran-targets/iran-targets.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25566/iran-targets.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" size="2"&gt;Got &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt;? Click on the image for more information on casualties and the &lt;p&gt;cities and intallations likely to be targetted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the physicians, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="border-style: groove; border-color: rgb(150, 218, 131); width: 400px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weestimate that within 48 hours... over &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3 million people would die as aresult of the attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. About half of those would die fromradiation-related causes, either prompt casualties from the immediateradiation effects of the bomb, or from exposure to fallout. Forexample, the entire city of Isfahan would likely be covered in falloutproducing 1000 rems of radiation per hour, a fatal dose. Over 600,000people would suffer immediate injuries...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...within 48 hours,prevailing winds would spread fallout to cover a large area in Iran,most of Afghanistan and then spread on into Pakistan and India. Thereis little likelihood, in most seasons, that rain would mitigate thespread of fallout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, over &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;35 million people inIran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India would suffer significantradiation exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; of 1 rem per hour or above within four days..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSR used a different warhead for itscalculations than Hersh suggests is likely to be used.  But rather than argueshades of destructive magnitude, we'd think it a good idea if the Bushadministration simply put this option back in the box.  But some folkshave suggested that already... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Practice bombing runs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hersh US Navy pilots operating fromthe Arabian Sea have been practicing nuclear bombing runs against Iran sincelast summer. He says, “Late this winter, the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff sought toremove the nuclear option &lt;/span&gt;from the evolving war plans for Iran - withoutsuccess." Some senior staff have even threatened to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One insider is quoted as saying that themilitary attack is premised on the belief that "a sustained bombingcampaign in Iran will humiliate the religious leadership and lead thepublic to rise up and overthrow the government." Hersh says theofficial added, "I was shocked when I heard it, and asked myself, 'Whatare they smoking?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Preventive war: illegal, unethical, ineffective. Everyone's invited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preventive war doctrine -threatening to attack before any attack or overt threat appears -- isbeing operationalised. Preventive war is the US military standard now -rather than the exception - as enshrined in the Nuclear Posture Reviewof 2001, the National Security Strategy from March 2006, andparticularly the new Global Strike Mission -- otherwise known by thecatchy name of "CONPLAN 8022."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizens of many Europeancountries need to know that The Global Strike Mission means that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;if theUS decides to strike with nuclear weapons, their own countries willlikely be part of that war effort&lt;/span&gt; -- whether they like it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innocent people, and perhaps unwilling governments, will share in the responsibility andrepercussions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Hans M. Kristensen in a report for &lt;a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/stratcom/GSchron.htm"&gt;Federation of American Scientists&lt;/a&gt;"Global Strike incorporates not only strategic long-range weaponslaunched from the United States, but also - potentially - nuclear bombsdeployed in Europe or weapons that could be moved into a theatre incase of a crisis. A preemptive strike could use a B61 nuclear bombdeployed in Turkey or a strategic warhead launched from a Tridentsubmarine off Japan." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Foreign Secretary Jack Strawtold BBC Television that a US military strike was "not on the agenda"and any idea that Washington could use tactical nuclear weapons againstIran was "completely nuts."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to theWashington Post, "The British government has launched its own planningfor a potential US strike, studying security arrangements for itsembassy and consular offices, for British citizens and corporateinterests in Iran and for ships in the region and British troops inIraq.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; British officials indicate their government is unlikely toparticipate directly in any attacks.&lt;/span&gt;"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it appears that British thinking runs, "It may be nuts, but crazy people do crazy things so its best to beprepared!"  What a special relationship.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for British personnel, we know from the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/nuclear-warplans-101/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations&lt;/a&gt;which was published on the Pentagon's internet site, (and then yanked),that the military chiefs have had some discussion about the etiquetteof alerting allied troops that a nuclear attack is coming their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Time for a preventative peace strike&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the US decides on a nuclear attack against Iran,they could use US nuclear bombs currently spread throughout a number of NATOcountries: the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'reseeking the assurance from the Heads of State and Defence Ministers ofthese countries that they will not provide any political or practicalsupport for any military action against Iran, especially action thatinvolves nuclear weapons. You can join us in that call. All we ask is a simple promise thatthe US would be prohibited from using European bases, equipment, andintelligence for any military strike, and that the US would not begranted over-flight rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the diplomatic path to a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/regional-solutions/peace-in-the-middle-east/"&gt;nuclear-weapons-free Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/regional-solutions/nuclear-weapons-free-zones/"&gt;nuclear-weapons-free world&lt;/a&gt;,  the six NATOcountries which currently host US nuclear weapons should immediately instruct the USto take the weapons back and dismantle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military action at any juncture in this crisis would have catastrophic consequences, unleashingyears or decades of regional and global violence.  Nuclear disarmament is essential to the cause of  peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tell NATO not to nuke Iran!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/nuclear/disarmament/us-nuclear-warplans-against-ir"&gt;Ask the Foreign Minsters of the six European nations which currently host US nuclear weapons to state clearly that they won't help with plans to attack Iran.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists occupy an area in 1,645 hectares of the Amazon that has been illegally deforested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon rainforest needs no introduction; the mere mention of
itsname conjures up images of a huge untouched wilderness bursting
withamazing life. But to McDonald's and a handful of huge soya
traders, theAmazon means something completely different. It means
cheap land andcheap labour. Cheap land because it is often stolen,
cheap labourbecause some of the people who work cutting down the
forest or work onthe farms in the Amazon are actually slaves.  You
heard it right,slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;" class="Box green"&gt;UPDATE, JULY 25,
2006: Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and
letterssent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters,
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/McVictory-200706"&gt;
McDonald'shas agreed&lt;/a&gt; to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown
in newlydeforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'How is this possible,' you ask? Well it goes something like
this.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thesoya traders encourage farmers to cut down the rainforest and
plantmassive soya monocultures. The traders take the soya and ship
it toEurope where it is fed to animals like chickens and pigs. The
animalsare then turned into fast food products like McDonald's
McNuggets andmany other products found in fast food outlets and
supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thejourney from rainforest to restaurant might sound simple
enough but ithas taken a year-long investigation using satellite
images, aerialsurveillance, previously unreleased government
documents andon-the-ground monitoring to expose.  What we found was
a globaltrade in soya from rainforest destruction in the Amazon to
McDonald'sfast food outlets and supermarkets across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the global trade insoya is controlled by a small number
of massive traders: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bunge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. In Brazil, this cartel plays the roleof bank to the farmers.
Instead of providing loans they give farmersseed, fertiliser and
herbicides in return for soya at harvest: Bungealone provided the
equivalent of nearly US$1 billion worth of seed,fertiliser and
herbicides to Brazilian farmers in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thisgives the companies indirect control over huge areas of land
that usedto be rainforest. Together, these three companies are
responsible foraround 60 percent of the total financing of soya
production in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thestate of Mato Grosso is Brazil's worst in terms of
deforestation andforest fires, accounting for nearly half of all
the deforestation inthe Amazon in 2003-04. In Mato Grosso, the
governor, Blairo Maggi, isknown locally as the 'Soya King'. His own
massive soya company GrupoAndre Maggi controls much of the soya
production in the state and sincehis election in 2002, forest
destruction in Mato Grosso has increasedby 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks too have been caught up in thedestruction of the Amazon.
The &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;International Finance Corporation (IFC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,the private lending arm of the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;World Bank&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, wrongly assessed a loan toGrupo Andre Maggi as being of 'low
environmental risk,' despiteevidence to the contrary. Other banks
have also lent huge sums of moneyto the company without conducting
their own environmental or socialimpact audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rabobank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, the Netherlands' biggestagricultural bank has lent over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;US$330 million&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to Grupo Andre Maggi.Rabobank admitted that it didn't do its own
assessment of the risk ofthe loans, simply accepting the (flawed)
assessment of the IFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast food and supermarkets, soya traders and big banks are
all trashing the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ifwe can track soya beans more than 7,000km (4,400 miles) from
farms inthe Amazon to chicken products in Europe, there is no
excuse for thefood industry not to know where their feed comes
from, and to demandthe exclusion of Amazon soya from their supply
chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUmcamazon"&gt;Help us stop the destruction of the Amazon. We don't accept money from corporations or governments in order to maintain our independence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We have arrested a pirate fishing vessel stealing fish off the coast of Guinea, taking a Guinean Navy officer and a fisheries inspector and working with crew from the Esperanza and the Environmental Justice Foundation.  Our onboard campaigner, Sarah Duthie, said, "Today we found one pirate – but we know there is a fleet of them out here and in every other ocean, stealing fish every day.”

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first light this morning, the Greenpeace helicopter flew over
agroup of fishing vessels 60 miles off the coast of Guinea. One was
noton the list of ships authorized to fish. An inflatable boat
waslaunched from the Greenpeace ship M.Y Esperanza, taking a
Guinean Navyofficer and a fisheries inspector with crew from
Greenpeace and theEnvironmental Justice Foundation on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After confirming the ship, the Lian Run No 14 - one of afamily
of Chinese vessels observed in the area - had no license, theship
was arrested. The Esperanza will now escort her to Conakry andhand
her over to officials on shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain of the Lian Run No 14 claimed documentation
waslodged in Las Palmas - the fish laundering capital of the world.
Inaddition, all the boxes being used to pack the stolen fish bore
thenames of other vessels, proving that even licensed vessels
collaboratewith the pirates to sell illegally caught fish on the
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish boxes with the names of seven other vessels were found
onboard the Lian Run No 14, proving how licensed vessels are
packingtheir boxes with illegal catch from the Lian Run No 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that they had boxes on board destined for Europe
andclaimed to be represented in Las Palmas shows a clear link
between thefood being stolen from Africa and the fish being served
on the dinnertables of Europe," said Helene Bours of the
Environmental JusticeFoundation.&lt;/p&gt;

	"This year I will again sow maize. But if it is again contaminated [with genetically engineered maize] I will abandon the growing of organic maize. It is obvious that I cannot carry on my shoulders the episodes of contamination like these, year after year."
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/farmerburningharvest.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/farmerburningharvest.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Spanish farmers burn organic crops contaminated with genetically engineered maize.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chilling statement came from Enric Navarro, an organic
maize[corn] grower from Girona in Spain whose farm has been
dedicated toorganic maize cultivation for the last four years. This
year his cropwas contaminated by genetically engineered [GE]
maize.  He doesn'tknow where it came from.  It could have been from
any non-organicfield, quite literally, anywhere on the wind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When GE crops are allowed to "coexist" in the open with organic
crops, what you sow isn't always what you reap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enricchose to burn nearly two-thirds of his organic maize crop
after testingrevealed up to 12.6 percent of it was contaminated
with GE, rather thansell his crop at a premium through the organic
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He followed his conscience. He suffered a massive economic
loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andhe isn't alone. Other organic farmers have burned their crops
ratherthan allow them to further contaminate the Spanish maize
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width: 190px; float: left; font-size: x-small;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25568/enric-navarro-spanish-organic.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enric Navarro&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Iwouldn't be able to sleep at night if I got into the
conventionalmarket with contaminated maize. Even though I know that
there arethousands of hectares of GE maize and that our food chain
is floodedwith it, I felt I could at least intervene in stopping my
ownproduction. This act was done to publicly denounce the situation
we arecurrently living with here in Cataluña with GE." Said
Enric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thechoice facing his home region is clear to Enric: "If Cataluña
abandonsGE, I will continue to make organic maize. If not the
organic maizewill disappear. That simple. That sad."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More stories like Enric's are highlighted in a new report, '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impossible-coexistence/"&gt;
Impossible Coexistence&lt;/a&gt;,'which was recently released by
Greenpeace and two Spanish NGOs,Assemblea Pagesa and civil society
group 'Plataforma Trangènics Fora!'.The report documents Spain's
reckless adoption of geneticallyengineered maize and the subsequent
disasters that have befallen manyof the conventional and organic
farmers in two of the main GE growingregions Aragón and
Cataluña.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conference on so-called coexistence is underway in Vienna
where EU delegates will decide on the future of GE cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economiclosses like Enric's are a grim reminder of why countries
should closethe door to genetic pollution, especially as consumers
do not want itand markets are closed to this unsafe technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enric hadthis advice to the politicians: "To solve the GE
problem and itssocial, environmental and health implications, the
only option is tonot cultivate a type of crop that the citizens do
not want."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=enric-navarro-ge-story"&gt;Enric has made his stand against GE. Will you? Sign up as an online activist and see what you can do to help stop the spread of GE crops. It's free. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We maintain our independence by not accepting corporate donations.

	A sensational leaked document obtained today by Greenpeace reveals that the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is considering realigning the agency's mission from promoting nuclear power towards renewable energy.

            Close up of the IAEA memo.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;===================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;DISCLAIMER - Of course this was an April Fools joke.But it
raises a serious issue that the UN uses tax payers money topromote
dirty,dangerous nuclear power.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Read more about &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/nuclear/nuclear-power"&gt;
our campaign against nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===========================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25570/leaked-iaea-internal-memo.pdf"&gt;
short internal memo&lt;/a&gt; dated today and intended for circulation
tostaff at the Agency, IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei
outlineshis intention to reframe the agency's mission
statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whilst I alone cannot change the mandate of the Agency, I am
conveninga panel of experts under my direction to prepare a report
for the nextGeneral Conference in September. Their remit will be to
find the bestapproach for the agency to become a world leader and
advocate ofrenewable energy sources"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our nuclear expert and regular IAEA watcher, William Hill
stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At first we didn't believe it, we thought it was a joke. Now
that it hassunk in we welcome the acknowledgement of the
fundamental hypocrisy ofthe IAEA's dual role and the responsible
recognition that it wasunsustainable. We are disappointed that
immediate change has not beenmade and further dismayed at the
likelihood that the consultativeperiod will be dominated by
industry interests. We will, however,almost certainly open a bottle
of champagne today to mark this historicdevelopment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have long been  critics of the IAEA's conflicting dual role.
Onthe one hand, it is in charge of preventing the spread of nuclear
weaponsand leading member states towards nuclear disarmament. But
it alsopromotes civil nuclear power programs that provide the means
to buildnuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only yesterday we received a call from an agency insider
claiming hehad proof of dramatic developments at the IAEA.
Identifying himselfonly as Art Sixnofour he set up an elaborate
hand-over of the leakeddocument in a Vienna park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have not been in possession of the document long enough
tofully analyse the implications and confirm the details of the
proposedplan, we believe its explosive contents justified rapid
release of thedocument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is too soon to assume the Agency's mission will change but we
canonly applaud ElBaradei's courage in seeking to remove the
foolhardy contradictionat the heart of the current IAEA mission
statement. The world will be asafer place if his proposal is
adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;This might have been a joke for April1st, but it makes a serious point. By promoting the dangerous myth ofAtoms for Peace and nuclear power, the IAEA is responsible forspreading the very things it seeks to control: nuclear weaponstechnology and materials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greenpeace believes that the only wayto stop the spread of nuclear weapons is for the nuclear weapons statesto disarm and for the world to reject the technologies and materialsused to produce them, by changing to promoting peaceful renewableenergy sources the IAEA would be acting to combat the two most pressingthreats facing the world today, climate change and nuclearproliferation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Exposed - Korea's plans for new whale meat factory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-korea-s-secret-plans/</url><text>
	Ulsan, host city of this year's International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting, is enthusiastically building a whale museum and a brand new marine park in anticipation. But we have uncovered plans, noticeably absent from the Ulsan council's bright and cheery website, that include a whale meat factory and whale burial ground. Is this the "city for whales", as they like to say, or the "city for whaling"?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/4/activists-in-ulsan-protest-ko.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/4/activists-in-ulsan-protest-ko.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists in Ulsan protest Korean plans to return to whaling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have set up a protest camp, or 'Whale Embassy', at the
proposedwhale meat factory site, working together with activists
from theKorean Federation for Environment Movement (KFEM). The
whale museumwith its prominently displayed harpoon boat, and a
street of whale meatrestaurants, overlook the site which is covered
in piles of rocky soil,since the marine park is still under
construction. A 12 metre highbeacon towers above the camp as a
symbol of the danger for whales.Scattered around the rocks are
large wooden whale flukes symbolisinggravestones in the "whale
burial ground".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Embassy itself consists of a large green dome, inside of
whichwe have information on the plight of whales and our own
alternative"whale museum". The dome is flanked by two huge
inflatable whales,which have drawn a lot of bemused stares from
local joggers andrestaurant-owners across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, officials say that Korea has not yet decided
whether or not it will vote to resume whaling at this years'
IWC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why would the South Korean government invest in a brand new
whale anddolphin meat processing factory unless it's already
decided to rebuildits whaling industry? Let them deny it if it's
not true," said JimWickens, our oceans campaigner, from the protest
camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunting of whales is banned internationally but the South
Koreangovernment currently sanctions a national trade in the meat
of whalesand dolphins that are caught accidentally in nets.
However, governmentstatistics show around a hundred times more
whales are "accidentally"caught in Korea than in countries that do
not have a domestic whalemeat market. Scientists believe that even
the most populous whalespecies in Korean waters, minke whales, are
in serious decline becauseof this trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just foreigners to Korea who feel that it's time for
whalingto be put in the past for good. Ye-Yong Choi, from KFEM,
said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whales in Korea's oceans, like whales everywhere, need
urgentprotection. History shows us that killing them in the name of
scienceor commerce will lead to their demise. Instead of repeating
themistakes of the past, let's protect our ocean life and make our
seas awhale sanctuary, instead of a whale cemetery."&lt;/p&gt;

	Imagine a football pitch as you've seen it many times. It's a bit less than one hectare in area. Now imagine that same football pitch packed end-to-end with a pile of wood around twice the height of Mt. Everest. That's the amount of forest that is imported into China every year, and the pile is getting higher. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Merbau timber from Indonesia stored at the Yuzhou Wood Market on the banks of the River Pearl, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developed industrial economies of North America, Europe,
Japan and South Korea are timber gluttons and consume more timber
than the planet can sustainably provide. That's the bad news. The
worse news is that the timber over consumption habit is beginning
to rub off on the emerging mega-economy of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report recently released by Greenpeace called '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sharing-the-blame/"&gt;
Sharing the Blame&lt;/a&gt;' shows that in the past 10 years, timber
imports into China have increased by an enormous 4.5 fold to the
double Mt. Everest sized pile mentioned above. This huge volume of
extra timber isn't all being consumed in China however, with
exports of timber products from China increasing by 3.5 fold in the
same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst demand for timber products has risen sharply in China,
the demand in the world's big industrial economies has remained at
an all time high. China has become the clearinghouse for the
world's timber with every second tropical tree traded in the world
being sent to China. Unfortunately, much of the merchandise is
stolen goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest is felled in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, where
between 76 to 90 percent of the logging is illegal, and shipped to
China to be processed into plywood, furniture or paper and exported
to the forest hungry economies of North America, Europe, Japan and
South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sharing-the-blame/"&gt;
Sharing the Blame&lt;/a&gt;' isn't only about the frightening statistics
of the global timber trade; it follows the illegally logged timber
from the forest to the finished product in the shops and names the
companies behind the illicit trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being contacted by Greenpeace and presented with the
evidence, some international timber buyers have already started to
address the issue of purchasing timber products made from illegal
logging. Numerous companies in Europe have made commitments to stop
purchasing Chinese plywood made from illegally logged timber from
Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has also started to publicly acknowledge
that consumption issues must be tackled in China. In recognition of
this problem, in late March of this year, the government imposed a
5 percent consumption tax on disposable chopsticks and hardwood
flooring to try to stem the tide of forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this is a good start, the fact that so many companies
internationally have been purchasing illegal timber products
without knowing or caring shows that governments of the world have
to get tough with the illegal logging trade and ban imports of
illegal timber products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility for ending the over-exploitation of the
world's last forests is shared equally between the producer and the
consumer countries. The developed industrial economies of North
America, Europe, Japan and South Korea need to dramatically reduce
their consumption of timber products and China needs to find a way
to develop its economy without simply following the poor example of
the timber gluttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the numbers are added up and put into neat rows and
columns of figures, it is easy to forget that what isn't shown in
the statistics are lives; people's lives and the lives of the
plants and animals of the forests. And if you put everything back
together, all the pieces combine to equal a couple of Mt. Everests
of ancient forest disappearing before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUnumbersgame"&gt;Help us stop the trade in illegal timber.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A land-grabber who has destroyed untold swaths of forest in the Amazon and a Swiss multinational illegally growing genetically engineered crops near a protected nature reserve. Both targeted by Greenpeace, both now facing action by the government of Brazil for their environmental crimes.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists occupy an area in 1,645 hectares of the Amazon that has been illegally deforested and unfurled a huge 2,500 square meter banner. The President of the Agricultural Producers Association in Santarem, – José Donizetti – is held directly responsible by the Brazilian Environmental Agency IBAMA for this illegal deforestation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The green wall of forest on either side of the dusty road gives
way to a denuded clearing. The naked brown soil contrasts starkly
with the jumbled growth of the rainforest surrounding it. From the
air, it looks like a fresh wound, the forest cut open by chainsaws
and bulldozers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the clearing, our activists and members of the local
community get ready to send a message to those that destroy the
Amazon. In the middle of the 1645-hectare illegal clearing they
deploy a huge banner: '&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;100% Crime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week and a half after our protest at the site of the forest
destruction, we receive the good news, the man held responsible for
the destruction is being brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;José Donizetti was arrested on 17 March in Santarem, a city in
Pará state, Brazil. He is accused of illegally deforesting 1,645
hectares, destroying Brazil nut trees - protected under Brazilian
Law - and is also accused of interfering in the work of the
Brazilian Environmental Agency (IBAMA), as well as disrespecting
federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time Donizetti has faced justice in Brazil;
he has been fined twice before for illegal land clearance. Our
protest at the site of his latest crime 11 days before his arrest
didn't go unchallenged. During the peaceful protest he arrived at
the scene in a truck with a number of other men. He threatened the
activists and the local community members who were symbolically
planting native trees. In a rage, he drove his truck over the '100%
Crime' banner the activists had unfurled in the middle of the
illegal clearing and, in the words of one who was there, '100%
destroyed it.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="100percentcrime" align="middle" height="201" width="302"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a watchdog, not a police dog. When we expose
environmental crimes, we rely on the forces of law to do something
about it. Jose Donizetti isn't the only one currently under the
spotlight of Brazilian justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enormous Swiss company Syngenta was fined nearly 400,000
euros after they were caught illegally growing genetically modified
crops next to a national park. Greenpeace is demanding the
immediate destruction of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine is yet another blow to Syngenta after the company's
home country rejected the growing of GMOs in the alpine nation in a
referendum late last year and comes a year to the day that it was
revealed to the European Commission that Syngenta had released
unauthorised and untested GMO maize (BT10) in the US and in exports
to EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King said that, "the arc of the moral universe is
long, but it bends toward justice." In at least these two cases in
Brazil, the universe is bending the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUbustedbrazil"&gt;Help us fight the destruction of the Amazon and the spread of GMO's.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Since the US and the UK are having such a hard time finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we thought we'd lend a hand by providing this easy guide to the nukes we know about.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN Weapons Inspectors and citizen weapons inspectors are welcome
to use our map to check up on just where those elusive Weapons of
Mass Destruction have been hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information about these locations has been drawn from public
sources, so we didn't have to worry about invading any countries,
incurring civilian casualties, paying costly bounties for inside
information or mess around with torture or illegal detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the best part: if the US and the UK want to dismantle
some WMDs, they don't need to go on costly excursions to foreign
countries. We found plenty in their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://dynamic.greenpeace.org/wmdmap/map-image.jpg" alt="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" title="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can view the map by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="breadcrumbs"&gt;Requires Macromedia Flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next two weeks, the parties to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) will be meeting in Geneva. Under the
terms of that 1970 accord, the world's non-nuclear weapons states
agreed to stay that way. In exchange, the countries that fessed up
to owning nuclear weapons at the time agreed to get rid of
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope the delegates to the NPT will have a quick look at the
map to easily identify the "bad guys" who haven't been disarming as
they promised. (Clue: &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;there are a lot of little
radiation symbols&lt;/a&gt; in France, the US, China, Russia, and the
UK.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a careful review of available data, you too can confirm
the blindingly obvious: none of the NPT's Nuclear Five have done
very well in scaling back their nuclear arsenals. They've failed
utterly to eliminate them. If the nuclear powers are seriously
concerned about the WMDs of India, Pakistan, Israel, and Korea,
they ought to look to the example they set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now call us old fashioned, but we believe that a key lesson of
the Iraq crisis is that international laws and treaties to prevent
proliferation must be strengthened, not weakened. All of us who
marched against the Iraq war want to see the North Korean crisis
and future proliferation problems solved by negotiation, not
pre-emptive military strikes. "In the long run, the most effective
means to halt proliferation is the rule of law applied universally
and even-handedly to all states, not unilateral gunboat diplomacy,"
says William Peden, of Greenpeace International's disarmament
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NPT declares disarmament the international norm - 182 of its
187 members have pledged never to acquire nuclear weapons. But some
of those states, such as Brazil, are becoming increasingly
aggravated with the failure of the Nuclear Five to live up to their
part of the bargain. North Korea recently left the treaty regime
and has declared itself to be a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25814/ace.gif" border="0" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/press/release?item_id=227966&amp;amp;campaign_id="&gt;
activists dressed as missiles&lt;/a&gt; appeared at the missions of the
nuclear weapons states in Geneva as the meeting began to demand
"inspectors" symbolically dismantle the cardboard arsenals.
Greenpeace also issued a &lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
deck of cards&lt;/a&gt; with the pictures of the known nuclear "bad guys"
to provide guidance to the NPT delegates about who needed to
disarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what we want to see out of this round of the NPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Korea should abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons and
rejoin the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the use of military force to resolve
proliferation concerns, and uphold the value of multilateral legal
mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the "first strike" use of nuclear weapons,
and agree legally binding security assurances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All nuclear weapon states should commit to the goal of
eliminating their illegal nuclear arsenals and halting the
development of new nuclear weapons or the "refurbishment" of
existing ones.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should agree an emergency mechanism to deal more swiftly
and effectively with future crises such as North Korea's withdrawal
from the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The promotion of "dual use" nuclear technology, particularly
reprocessing and enrichment technologies, which is permitted under
the NPT, should be stopped and a comprehensive ban on the
production and use of all fissile material agreed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If there are nuclear weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we hope
the right people find them. But we're not exactly sure who the
right people would be, given their mission ought to be something
the US and UK are not very good at: dismantling them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

	As you may not have heard, the folks who signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are meeting this week in Geneva, Switzerland.  They're scratching their heads over why the treaty has utterly failed to stop non-nuclear states from going nuclear (like India and Pakistan and Israel and Korea) as well as failing to force the nuclear-capable states to disarm.

            The Greenpeace 'Most Wanted' deck of nuclear evil-doers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the NPT was agreed in 1968, there were approximately 38,000
weapons in the world. Today, there are approximately 30,000. What
have these guys been doing for the last 35 years, playing
poker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if so, we figured we had to adopt our communication
methods to the audience. So instead of putting another 30 million
people out on the streets worldwide to shout for peace, we made
them a special deck of playing cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cards are good enough for the US military to use to educate
soldiers in how to spot bad guys, we figured they were good enough
for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our "most wanted" pack includes pictures of some real
deal-welshers -- world leaders who promised to disarm and get rid
of their weapons of mass destruction, but didn't do so. Leaders who
never signed the treaty, and went off to pursue nuclear weapons on
their own. And one leader whose country did sign the treaty, and
then went off and developed nuclear weapons anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these pictures will help the delegates to the NPT spot
the evil doers. If they need help finding the evidence, we also
published a handy &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/wmdmap"&gt;map
with the known locations of plenty of Weapons of Mass
Destruction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remind the delegates of just how big a job they've got to do,
and to help them with their speeches, we've also included a set of
easy-to-understand nuclear factoids, with our deck, one per
card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're just chock full of surprises for anybody who's been
concentrating on cutting the deck instead of cutting back on nukes.
Like this one, from the 5 of diamonds: "The latest US/Russia
nuclear disarmament treaty, signed in 2002, will not involve the
destruction of any nuclear weapons." Huh? What was all that fanfare
about when Putin and Bush were being all buddy buddy? Good heavens,
you don't think it could have been PR spin, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this one, from the 9 of clubs: "The US wants to build a
facility capable of producing 450 nuclear weapons cores annually."
That ought to raise the stakes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One really great thing about our deck of cards is that they were
partially subsidized by the US military. Not knowingly, of course.
We went to the same printers that they used for their "Iraqi
Leadership Most Wanted" deck, and since the printing plates had
already been made up, we got a discount. So in fairness, we ought
to give them a little plug here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All of these facts about how the world is bristling with
nuclear weapons are made possible by the US Government."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Let it not be said we don't give credit where credit is
due.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we only intended to give our cards to delegates and
journalists at the NPT, the story got out into the press, and
suddenly we were being asked how much the cards cost and where
folks can get them. We initially printed 600 of them, and those are
all gone... with the exception of a few our &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=2175679042"&gt;
fund raising department snagged and are auctioning off on Ebay.&lt;/a&gt;
(Don't be fooled by the scammers that are selling PDF files for
US$3.99. The PDF files are available free &lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be doing a reprinting of the cards soon, but in the
meantime, you can amuse yourself and learn just how effectively the
NPT is working by playing our&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt; &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/cards/game.html"&gt; Nuclear Solitaire Game&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It features the same cards we gave out to the delegates,
presented (appropriately enough for a 35-year-old treaty that
hasn't accomplished much) in the perennial time-wasting and
unilateralist format of a game of Solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

something about nuclear weapons, why not become a cyberactivist?

	What we've lost, what we have left and what we will lose if we don't act now. That is the message that the latest global maps of the planet's last intact forests and most vulnerable ocean areas tell us.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maps were launched at the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD)as government delegates begin negotiating how to stop the
world'splants and animals from disappearing forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; of the last intact forests&lt;/span&gt;

map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; of the ocean areas most in need of protection &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TheCBD has set itself the goal of significantly reducing the
number ofplants and animals becoming extinct by 2010 for life on
land and 2012for ocean life. It is an ambitious target given that
they have barelystarted the work after 14 years of painfully slow
negotiations betweenthe more than 180 counties who have signed the
convention.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ourlatest maps show that implementing a global network of large
protectedareas, which are required to stop the slide towards
extinction for manyplants and animals can be achieved now. The map
of the remaining intactforest areas was created using the latest
satellite images and is themost up-to-date map of its kind. The map
of the oceans uses the latestresearch to determine the areas of the
ocean in most need ofprotection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If the global network of protected areas isn'timplemented,
within 20 years, a huge portion of the planet's plants andanimals
will be lost forever. There has never been a more urgent needfor
action.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Governments can use these new maps to fast tracka global
network of large, protected areas both on land and at sea.They can
no longer use the lack of maps and data as an excuse for nottaking
action to halt the biological catastrophe we are facing. If
theydon't, we run the risk of losing even more species forever, and
in sodoing jeopardising our own survival," said Greenpeace
Internationalforest campaigner, Christoph Thies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the mapscoincides with Greenpeace campaigns to
highlight the globalbiodiversity crisis. Greenpeace is in the heart
of the Amazoncampaigning to prevent it being cleared to grow
agricultural productsuch as soy. Greenpeace has also set up a &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/"&gt;Global Forest
Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; in the Paradise Forests of Papua New Guinea to
protect the forests from illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At sea, our ship the Esperanza is continuing its 15-month long
&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/"&gt;Defending Our Oceans
Expedition&lt;/a&gt;,currently focused on stopping pirate fishing and
securing sustainablefuture livelihoods for the millions of people
living in coastal communities who dependon the marine environment
for food and income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge forthe world is to use these maps as a roadmap to
recovery and not as asad reminder to future generations of what we
could have saved if onlythe governments of the world had acted.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Genetic engineering stuck in the Dark Ages of science</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/genetic-engineering-stuck-in-d/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;50 years after the discovery of the double helix, why are genetic engineers clinging to old science?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fifty years ago, in 1953, the structure of DNA was discovered and hailed as the "secret of life". A complete understanding of living organisms seemed to be certain. However, fundamental questions regarding how DNA and genes actually work remained unanswered.  Genetic engineering (GE), at its roots, is based on an over-simplistic theory from the 1950s. Modern science has since shown gene expression to be far more complex than imagined.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Still living on a flat Earth
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology and tools to insert genes from different species
in a crude, random and often forcible manner into the genomes of
organisms were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and termed "genetic
engineering". Genetic engineering was called a "life" science; it
was the technology to design and shape living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current genetic engineering industry is based on a 50 year
old understanding of molecular biology: that a gene is unaffected
by its local surroundings on the genome. The outcome of
transferring a gene from one organism to another is thought to be
specific and predictable. However, this is now regarded by most
scientists as an over-simplified theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene expression is now understood to be regulated by a complex
cellular network. Gene expression is the result of many reactions
and interactions between elements such as proteins and RNA. The
significance of these interactions is increasingly being
recognised, but remains far from being fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scientific reality is being ignored by GE companies like
Monsanto, Bayer and Syngenta. Short-term, economic interests keep
these companies holding on to an old-fashioned and outdated
scientific understanding that no longer has a sound scientific
basis. This behaviour becomes reckless when these companies release
their genetic experiments into the environment and hide it in our
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some GE crops such as soya and maize, have been commercialised
and deliberately released into the environment and food chain in
the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprising and unpredictable effects have occurred in these
crops. In one example, GE Roundup Ready soya plants unexpectedly
split their stems in high temperatures, probably because of a
higher amount of lignin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE companies regard such unexpected effects as technical
problems to be overcome by more research or adapted technologies.
However, these unforeseen effects may be due to a more fundamental
reason, that the basis of GE is invalid. Recent science has shown
that the expression of genes in the DNA of cells is not nearly as
simple and not as fully understood as the GE industry would like us
to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

	"Yea I hope you sail that [expletive deleted] Rainbow warrior up to a US warship, and I hope they blow you to kingdom come, Have a nice Day."  That's the kind of message (along with endlessly unimaginative variations) that we've been getting since we started taking action against the build up to war in Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/2/greenpeace-volunteers-entered.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace volunteers  entered Southampton's Marchwood Military Port letting off coloured flares and setting up a peace camp in the military tanks destined for the Gulf.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"If you go out there you will be
blown out of the water by our navy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I'm now leaving Greenpeace!!! You
are hurting the Greenpeace name - making the organisation a
political forum against war."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I've been a Greenpeace supporter in
the past, but after seeing your ships trying to block [military
ships]... I will never send another dime to Greenpeace, which
really is a pity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I'm not surprised to see that your
international office is HQ'd in Germany! A perfect place for
sissies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For the record, Greenpeace International is headquartered in
Amsterdam, which is in the Netherlands.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're averaging around 300 emails a day here at Greenpeace
International headquarters about our stance against this war. Much
of it is unprintable hate-mail. Some of it expresses surprise and
confusion about why we're taking an anti-war position. Some of it
comes with membership cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Karen and Ludmilla in our Supporter Services Department, who
field and respond to this daily barrage, it can be pretty
depressing. Especially when they get asked what they know about
war. Karen grew up in Northern Ireland, surviving the worst of the
troubles. Ludmilla grew up in Czechoslovakia and witnessed the
Velvet Revolution. Their personal experiences of a totalitarian
regime and bloodshed were part of what led them to Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news isn't all bad. In some of our offices there's been an
oupouring of support for our stance against the war. And while the
mail is 90 percent negative, every now and then, a little spark of
encouragement comes along that they can forward out to our folks in
the field - the people on our ships who have been braving military
security, freezing temperatures, arrest and harassment to stand up
for what they believe in. Here's two examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I want to congratulate you for the
action in Rotterdam concerning that ship with weapons for the next
Gulf War... I am really proud of belonging to and supporting such
an organization as Greenpeace. Keep fighting and try to show the
world that the US themselves do not fulfil many of the conditions
they try to impose on Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"As an American opposed to the
planned murder of many thousands of Iraqis at the hands of our
government, I salute and congratulate Greenpeace on the blocking of
the Military Port in Iraq protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;I've long been a Greenpeace
supporter, and remember the active part Greenpeace played in
demonstrations in [Washington] DC against the first Iraq war, and
heard that afterwards that the organization took a real hit in the
form of less people giving money or joining Greenpeace-- So all
that much better that Greenpeace is taking a principled stand on
Iraq and getting out and DOING something about it-- You are setting
a terrific example for the rest of us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message above bore a subject line of "Donation and why."
It's the kind of support that keeps us going, both emotionally and
financially. We rely on individual donations from nearly 3 million
people world-wide who give knowing we're going to do the right
thing, even when it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Have you donated lately? If you believe we're doing the right
thing in opposing this war, the best way to let us know is by &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/war/"&gt;joining us&lt;/a&gt;. Still not
sure? Read on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;But what about Saddam?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't support Saddam Hussein. We don't back any governments
or political leaders. When we decided to take a stand against this
war, it was because we see a far greater danger in the concept of
preventive war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has always been characterised by taking action
against global threats. We hope this is why most of our supporters
signed on in the first place. Regardless of whether this war is
prevented or not, and if not, regardless of who wins and how long
it takes, we honestly believe -no spin, but really in our hearts
believe - that it is wrong, and that in the long term the world
will be a much worse place in which to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one nation to take arms against another because it
&lt;i&gt;believes&lt;/i&gt; that nation to be a threat undermines the
foundations of peaceful coexistence, multilateral institutions like
the United Nations, and an "entire web of laws, treaties,
organisations, and shared values," to quote &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0227-13.htm"&gt;John Brady
Kiesling's letter of resignation&lt;/a&gt; from the US diplomatic
core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it may be to those who view Saddam as a cipher of
evil to step in and remove him militarily, one has to ask what's
next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the US conducts a preventive war on Iraq, will it set its
sights on Iran? North Korea? And if the US can wage a preventive
war to protect its national security, shouldn't India or Pakistan
have the same right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step on a slippery slope. It ends with the
United Nations in tatters and the rule of might making right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What does Greenpeace have to do with war?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a reason that Greenpeace has the word 'peace' in its
name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were founded on a disarmament issue, when a boatful of
hippies sailed to stop a nuclear weapons test in Amchitka, in the
Aleutian Islands off Alaska, in 1972. In the decades following we
sailed, walked, and flew against nuclear weapons testing in all the
Nuclear Weapons States, ran campaigns against missiles and
landmines, and stood up against war and its consequences in the
Persian Gulf and Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've not been present or outspoken against all wars, just as
we've not been present or outspoken against all crimes against the
environment. But from our earliest days, Greenpeace has been about
preserving the future of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four issues directly inform our campaign against this war:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3940"&gt;End
the nuclear threat&lt;/a&gt;: We support the elimination of weapons of
mass destruction. That means the US and other nuclear weapons
states living up to their commitments to disarm -- not just the
states that they oppose. Maintaining a world of nuclear "haves"
which take military action against "have nots" is not the way to
end the nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3937"&gt;Stop
climate change&lt;/a&gt;: This conflict is becoming a war because our
world is dependent on oil. The right path is to secure energy
independence for the US and all nations through renewables -- not
to secure more and more sources of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3941"&gt;Eliminate
toxics:&lt;/a&gt; War is the ultimate toxic cocktail. If we see the kind
of oil spills and fires that we saw in the last gulf war, along
with the chemical contamination of a conventional war, the region
will suffer another major environmental catastrophe. That's not
even to speak of the possibility of either side using chemical or
biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3943"&gt;Ensure
corporate responsibility:&lt;/a&gt; This war is brought to you by the oil
companies. In particular, Exxon has been driving US dependency on
oil by actively opposing the Kyoto protocol and denying climate
change to be a reality. If the US were on a path to renewable
energy, it wouldn't need to go to war to secure its oil supplies.
As we've said elsewhere, Saddam would be just another
run-of-the-mill tyrant among many in the world today were it not
for the fact that he may sit on up to a quarter of the world's oil
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposing war with Iraq is not a departure from Greenpeace's
agenda -- it's part of a continued opposition to policies and
actions that threaten our world's future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Conscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days of the cold war, our disarmament policies led to
accusations from both sides: in the West that we were funded by the
KGB, in the East that we were funded by the CIA. There was a time
when our policies against nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific
almost forced us to shut the doors of our Paris office for lack of
national support. And our actions against whaling have always
crippled support for Greenpeace in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters to us is not that we're popular, but that we're
following our conscience, and that enough people of conscience
agree with us to keep us going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you support that principle, and you support our view that
this war is wrong, please &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/war/"&gt;support Greenpeace.&lt;/a&gt;

	A decision by a French court to lift an injunction against the use of a parody logo on the StopEsso website was an important victory for free speech on the internet, a victory for the climate, and evidence that Esso's strategy to silence critics using the courts is futile.

            Parody of Esso logo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Esso is sabotaging climate protection in order to continue its
dirty business and has attempted to use the courts to silence its
critics. Today that strategy failed," said Greenpeace's Stephanie
Tunmore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso France began legal action against Greenpeace in July 2000
over the StopEsso website, which uses a logo featuring a double
dollar sign ($$) in place of the double "S" in the oil giant's red
and blue logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, a French judge upheld Esso's bid to get the
logo taken off the Greenpeace France website. But after hearing
Greenpeace's appeal, Justice Lacabarats in Paris found that
StopEsso's use of the logo was allowable under the right to free
speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is Esso's own behaviour interfering in international action
on climate change that is damaging its reputation," said
Tunmore.&lt;/p&gt;

	After a long and intense struggle by environmentalists world-wide, the British Columbia government agreed to protect 20 of the Great Bear Rainforest's most ecologically important valleys from all industrial activity. Another 68 valleys were placed under a moratorium until informed decisions could be made how to best manage the forest. It was an unprecedented move by a government and a heart-warming victory for all involved. But two years later few of the promises have made it off paper and into the forest.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's report card time and members of the British Columbia government will not be taking this one home to the family.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the world praised British Columbia for forging a
great consensus - the Great Bear Rainforest Agreement. In April
2001, the long and intense battle over the fate of BC's Great Bear
Rainforest, the largest area of intact temperate rainforest left on
Earth, resulted in what many viewed as a great first step and a win
for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BC government, First Nations, rural communities, forestry
companies and people concerned about conserving ancient forests for
posterity all walked away in agreement. A comprehensive solution
unlike anything the world has seen could happen in British
Columbia, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of the agreement was a commitment to a new way
of logging on the coast, one that valued the coast's unparalleled
ecological diversity, and abandoned relentless and indiscriminate
clearcut logging. And many of the most crucial areas of
biodiversity were set aside for future protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, environmentalists suspended an international markets
campaign that resulted in high-profile customers like Home Depot
and IKEA agreeing to stop buying forest products from the Great
Bear Rainforest if clearcut logging continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, what has the British Columbia government done to
ensure this unprecedented "peace in the woods" remains intact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with other groups ForestEthics, Rainforest Action Network
and the Sierra Club of Canada all involved in forging the agreement
and working toward long-term solutions for the region, we have
evaluated the government's progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictory direction and a lack of open communication from
the government are raising concerns about the fate of the Great
Bear Rainforest. Cases of inconsistent government timelines and
breaches of process are numerous. It appears that internal strife
within the government itself is holding back progress.
Opportunities for lasting solutions could be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the province may be upholding, for now, the letter of
the agreement, the constant delays and frequent attempts to
undermine the process and their boosterism of unsustainable
development belies any real commitment to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, BC's market reputation is at stake. A lack of
strong direction and clear communication from the government
regarding their commitment to a conservation solution for the Great
Bear Rainforest creates a climate of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a new survey by IBM Business Consulting of buyers who
annually purchase more than $2 billion worth of BC wood found that
"there is clear evidence of a greenward shift in the market for
forest products, including those from BC. The shift is real, buyers
believe it will continue, and it will have a negative impact on
forest regions and producers that do not respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But extensive analysis by the David Suzuki Foundation, Global
Forest Watch and the Raincoast Conservation Society shows that on
the ground logging companies have not changed their practices,
despite commitments on paper to "conservation" and
"sustainability".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the agreement was signed, 72 percent of the logging was
done through clearcutting. In other areas the trees left standing
in logging sites are too few to sustain old-growth dependent
species and these meagre patches of forest cannot be described as
old-growth "habitat".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements to practices are virtually non-existent and
destructive clearcutting of the Great Bear Rainforest continues
outside of the agreed moratoria areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, British Columbia has the opportunity to lead the
world and create lasting conservation solutions, as well as capture
new market share for environmentally responsible products. Will the
coming months be a time of unprecedented progress or increasing
uncertainty for BC's coast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The Report Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Protection: D-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after the historic "peace in the woods" agreement,
none of the valleys have been permanently protected. In May 2002,
the BC government placed the valleys in "interim" protection.
However, this expires in less than three months, then the valleys
will have no protection from development and logging could resume
anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Credible Science: C+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong team of biologists and ecologists has been pulled
together, and good work is being done on the ecosystem-based forest
management. But the work of this team remains underfunded and
behind schedule. The delays are due to government's sluggish
delivery of critical scientific data and analysis, largely because
of ill-advised reductions in technical capacity. It is unlikely
there will be enough time to understand or adequately incorporate
the team's work in to the final decisions for the Great Bear
Rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Forest Policy: D-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the BC government announced a package of
forestry reforms to agreements that have governed the relationship
between communities and logging companies for more than half a
century. While communities saw their longstanding benefits from
this contract simply eliminated with little in return, the logging
companies' benefits were greatly increased and further
entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These momentous changes have been drafted with the forest
industry behind closed doors and with no community consultation.
The government's policy changes will increase corporate powers by
allowing forest tenures to be subdivided and sold, while companies
are released from their obligations to run local mills and sustain
local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Ecological Management and Planning: F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Central Coast the government has been sluggish
providing essential data and analysis to the scientists who, in
turn, has been unable to meet the timetable for delivery of
information. Instead of delaying discussion until they have
credible information to use, the government is forcing the planning
table to go over old ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the North Coast several issues are causing profound concerns
among environmentalists including the tight timelines for the
planning process, limited capacity for First Nations to engage
effectively in this process, the government's continued approval of
raw log exports from the area and the proposed rapid expansion of
aquaculture on the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the government temporarily reduced the rate of logging
by removing 1.5 million hecatres from the Annual Allowable Cut, but
this decision also expires the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Managing Change: B-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there have been some positive steps, BC's government has
slashed existing community economic development programmes on the
coast and the infrastructure for assisting economic diversification
has not been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While little has been done in coastal communities, there are
various initiatives taking place, including development of
potential investment models to help fund economic transition for
communities that want to undertake conservation-based planning. To
date, these talks, while they are promising, have been slow. A
committee is working on this project and the government and others
have committed funds to develop new models and securing
conservation investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;First Nations Rights and Title: D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government-to-government protocol, signed by eight coastal
First Nations and the province, establishes mechanisms for land-use
planning and commits the two parties to both a framework for
environmentally responsible development and implementing agreements
that would provide economic opportunities for First Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The province and First Nations agreed to develop a range of
economic strategies for forestry, tourism and fisheries guided by
principles of ecologically responsible management. In the past year
progress has been made to plan activities, but First Nations still
have not had any direct benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the province's changes to forestry regulations will
further infringe on First Nations' rights through the weakening of
provincial oversight mechanisms, without which it is questionable
whether the government can fulfill its fiduciary obligations to
BC's indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the government's commitment to massive expansion of the
aquaculture industry has proven to be an enormously contentious
issue in First Nation communities. While one or two First Nations
are receptive to, or engaged in, fin-fish aquaculture, the huge
majority are adamantly opposed to the siting of this high-risk
industry in their traditional territories.&lt;/p&gt;

	We don't know if John Brady Kiesling is a member of Greenpeace, but we'd be proud of his company on any of our ships.  He's clearly earned his stripes at standing up against the powers that be.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            An Argentine anti-war activist wearing a Bush mask highlights the role of big oil companies such as Exxon/Esso in the impending war.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiesling is the career diplomat who resigned from the US Foreign
Service last week over plans to invade Iraq. We believe he has
taken a courageous and principled action which deserves worldwide
attention and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said his conscience would no longer allow him to represent
the Bush Administration in policies that are "incompatible not only
with American values but also with American interests," and goes on
to express a deep belief in America's potential as a force for good
in the world, and his deep disappointment in how it is "straining
beyond its limits an international system we built with such toil
and treasure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His central question to a president he says he can no longer
follow is "Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in
Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied Territories, to our
own advice, that overwhelming military power is not the answer to
terrorism?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0227-13.htm" target="_blank"&gt;full text of his letter of resignation&lt;/a&gt; to Colin
Powell was published in the New York Times on February 27th, and
has done the wildfire thing on the internet, rocketing up the ranks
at &lt;a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/track.asp?id=4503813" target="_blank"&gt;Blogdex&lt;/a&gt;, an outstanding barometer of what's
being talked about on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His letter is a stirring and articulate act of moral bravery,
and while it says nothing different than millions of people said
when they marched on February 15th, it does so with a different
authority. It comes from the ranks of those politicians who are
expected, like soldiers, to toe the line and salute the flag
without question. Kiesling broke ranks -the way few in history have
done, and the way many more should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The courage of saying "No" to war&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look back at the few examples of insiders who said no to
unjust wars, or to tyrants such as Hitler or Pol Pot or Saddam, we
always ask, with the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of the
waste of human life and resulting tragedies, 'Why did so many
follow? Why did more people not stand up and say no?'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope many people read this letter. We hope other American
diplomats read this letter and follow its lead either in stepping
up the pressure on the administration from within, or following
Kiesling's example and stepping down. We are encouraging newspapers
worldwide to reprint it, and for all who oppose this war to applaud
it. You can help by &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1046519318/index_html" target="_blank"&gt;taking action now&lt;/a&gt; to ensure Mr. Kiesling's
letter is widely read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Beware the oil barrons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the diplomat says that "The result, and perhaps the motive,
[of pursuing Iraq] is to justify a vast misallocation of shrinking
public wealth to the military and to weaken the safeguards that
protect American citizens from the heavy hand of government," he
echoes the famous, and still valid, warning of US President
Eisenhower to "beware the military industrial complex."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Kiesling leaves unsaid is that, in this day and age, the
most powerful player in that "complex" is big oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former diplomat makes a clear and compelling case for why we
should be worried about the political leadership of the United
States. But writing this off as the obsessions of an "ideological
and self-serving" president misses an important part of the
picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saddam Hussein would just be another run-of-the-mill tyrant,
probably unworthy of US attention, were it not for the vast oil
wealth he commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a darker force at work on US policy as well -- and it's
as dark as a barrel of Exxon crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help battle that force by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;joining the campaign
to stop Esso/Exxon&lt;/a&gt; from fuelling war by fuelling the world's
oil addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

            Activist holds the teather of the Balloon near the Utah Olympic Sports Park.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They've done something to help the planet! Recently McDonalds
took the first concrete step towards meeting their promise by
opening the first restaurant with environmentally friendly
refrigeration. Why this is such a significant step involves gases
that keep you alive, chemicals with long names, huge corporations
and the global chemical industry in retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Ozone Layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago the average person had no idea what the ozone
layer was, never mind know it was vital for sustaining life on
Earth. The dramatic discovery in 1986 of a hole in the ozone layer
changed all that and public opinion forced the chemical industry to
replace ozone destroying chemicals. Unfortunately few people
realise that the industry replaced the ozone destroyers with new
chemicals and new problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the upper atmosphere the ozone layer filters the
sun's deadly ultraviolet rays and allows all life to survive. The
discovery in the early 1970's that industrial chemicals like
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) damage the ozone layer along with the
dramatic discovery in 1986 of the Antarctic ozone hole forced
governments to enact measures to reduce and eliminate ozone
depleting substances. The chemical industry was compelled to reduce
the damage their products were inflicting upon the ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than use environmentally friendly replacements
it chose chemicals like Hydroflourocarbons (HFC's) that are
powerful greenhouse gases. These gases are several thousand times
more powerful than carbon dioxide in causing climate change. The
major industrial sector that uses HFC's is refrigeration and
air-conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first the industry claimed there were no alternatives to
these new refrigeration chemicals. But we knew that natural
chemicals such as ammonia and hydrocarbons were viable
environmentally friendly alternatives. Greenpeace responded by
developing a new environmentally safe domestic refrigerator using
hydrocarbons, which we called &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/extra/?forward%5fdestination%5fanchor=%252fcampaigns%252fintro%253fcampaign%25255fid%253d4012&amp;amp;campaign%5fid=4012&amp;amp;forward%5fsource%5fanchor=Solutions%2520Introduction&amp;amp;item%5fid=9207"&gt;
Greenfreeze&lt;/a&gt;. The chemical industry said it would never work and
the big refrigeration users lined up with their friends in the
industry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there are over 100 million Greenfreeze refrigerators in
the world, produced by all the major European, Chinese, Japanese
and Indian manufacturers. Greenfreeze is now available in most
major markets with the exception of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in the
domestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued to use refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to the Sydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such as Unilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors,
to live up to the guidelines of the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/archives/olympics/index.html"&gt;green
games&lt;/a&gt; which excluded HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after being faced with a &lt;a href="http://cokespotlight.org/"&gt;concerted internet campaign&lt;/a&gt;
before the 2000 Olympics to buy green refrigeration for new units.
Before the start of the games all three companies announced phase
out plans for damaging refrigeration technologies by the time of
the 2004 Olympics. While good words come easy, actually doing the
right thing is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently McDonald's in Denmark, took the first concrete step
towards meeting their promise by opening the first HFC/HCFC free
restaurant. Hopefully it will be the first of many such restaurants
for the company and that it will spark more sustainable innovation
from the refrigeration industry and others in the food service
sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though big corporations like McDonald's, Coca Cola,
Unilever and Nestle are taking steps to move away from
environmentally harmful products in refrigeration, the chemical
industry is still vigorously marketing its polluting products in
other applications like car and commercial air-conditioning. As
several European countries like Denmark, Austria and Germany have
either enacted or are considering legislation to ban and limit the
use of HFCs, the industry is keen to dominate the vulnerable
markets of developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the industry is fighting a losing battle and
will eventually have to admit that natural chemicals are a better
alternative. Industry not listening to environmentalists is nothing
new, but when some of your biggest corporate customers are
switching to green alternatives, then it really is time to
listen.&lt;/p&gt;

	Take one smooth, media savvy, corporate executive at the helm of the world's largest chemical company. Pit him against a few determined activists fighting for justice. Outcome a forgone conclusion? Throw a huge ongoing chemical disaster into the mix and in fact the outcome was a surprise to all.

        &lt;p&gt;
            M Parker - Former Dow CEO.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Parker was in charge of Dow Chemical. While not exactly corporate environmental enemy numero uno (that dubious honour goes to Lee Raymond, head of ExxonMobil) he consistently refused to consider helping survivors of the 1984 Union Carbide Gas disaster in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intrepid activists from the international campaign for justice in Bhopal had one goal in mind - to ensure Parker was not able to forget that Dow is now responsible for the ongoing suffering of thousands in Bhopal and a using only a fraction of Dow's huge annual turnover he could end the ongoing tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;23 October: Houston, Texas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker was out at a prime greenwashing opportunity at the Tenth Annual Houston Conservation Leadership Awards luncheon (a front group funded by dirty industry). Dow was sponsoring the awards to the tune of US$40,000 to brush up its image. While Parker espoused the wonderful contribution Dow makes to the environment our courageous activists were plotting to enliven proceedings beyond the mundane corporate backslapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech Parker was interrupted by a photographer who announced "We have someone here from Bhopal with a better award for you," she told him in front of 500 bemused guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booing from the Dow contingent at tables near the stage fell silent when Bhopali activist Kinnu appeared in her sari bearing two genuine Bhopali brooms. A flustered Parker was unsure what to do now his careful prepared speech was interrupted by some harsh reality. Kinnu told Parker that he was a liar to say that Dow had no liabilities in Bhopal. She told him that women living near the abandoned factory have mercury and other toxins in their breast milk and demanded that Dow take immediate action to clean up its mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker flapped for a moment, and then began repeating his old formula about remembering where he was in 1984 when he heard the news about Bhopal. Any activist who has written to Dow about Bhopal will be able to quote it word for word. During the commotion at the front, the 500 guests were being leafleted on why Dow should clean up Bhopal and some friendly words of advice - Investing a bit of capital in taking care of the Bhopal disaster would be so much better than this useless PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let hope at least a few guests left with a more realistic idea of Dow's contribution the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;15 November: University of Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Parker was gracing the University with a visit but just to make sure he doesn't forget, we were there to remind him of a few harsh truths. After his usual speech about morality, sustainability and how Dow is just the best damn company to work for in the world there was a gentle Q&amp;amp;A session lined up. Mr Parker got a preliminary question from the back about Bhopal. He gave the usual "I feel your pain, it was awful, I remember where I was when Bhopal happened, oh, but we have no liabilities thank you very much". However our student organiser, Azita, wasn't buying it, but Parker bought her sweet cherub smile and called on her next, expecting a soft question. Here is roughly how it played out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "Mr Parker, the liabilities in Bhopal can't be 'over' when people are still being poisoned every day?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I, uh, meant that our liabilities are over."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "Call me foolish, but I didn't think that corporations, could just determine when and if their liabilities are over. That's why we have courts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Um, yeah..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And you forgot to mention that your company is being sued in the Federal District Court of New York for contamination at the Bhopal site."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, we're actually trying to find a solution to this - we are currently in negotiations with Bhopal survivors -"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "No you're not. You see, I'm with Greenpeace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; (internal groan, face contorts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And we've been trying to ask you for almost a year to sit down with Bhopal survivor organisations and talk about the problems in Bhopal. And we've sent you over 50,000 postcards, emails and faxes to remind you to do this!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I....."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And that's why I want to present you with this book (Dominique Lapierre's Five Past Midnight in Bhopal)so you can read how the people of Bhopal suffer while you drag your feet in dealing with your liabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; (Begrudgingly takes the book. Gives Azita the look of death)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Facilitator:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, that's all the time we have today for questions for Mr. Parker. Thank you all for coming."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow contingent left the campus in a huff after their recruitment party was ambushed but not before they each got handed a copy of the technical guidelines to clean up the Bhopal site. Some nice bedtime reading maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we were not going to let Mr Parker get off lightly. After having being quoted as saying he will "be spending a few quiet moments of reflection" on the 18th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster. We decided to drop by to see if the quiet reflection lead to a change of heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;3 December 2002: Midland, Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 students from the University of Michigan along with environmental and social justice activists from around the state visited Michael Parker's house where they held a vigil to mark the 18th anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster. Rather than some quiet moments of reflection it appeared Parker was hosting a party instead. The activists were there to remind Mr Parker that they hold him personally responsible for the ongoing suffering in Bhopal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the vigil candles, Bhopal banners, tombstones, Parker "Wanted Posters" and other props didn't seem to distract the gleeful party goers, Michael Parker did step outside and debate the activists for approximately twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the now very familiar meaningless Bhopal waffle there were a few statements of interest from Mr Parker. He claimed he was "too busy" to see the suffering for himself in Bhopal. Pressed on the fact that the treatment of the victims is made harder by the composition of the gases leaked in the disaster being kept as trade secrets he claimed he know nothing of this and would ensure this information was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;10 December 2002: Midland, Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of announcing he intends to release trade secrets Mr Parker got canned by Dow. This firing was supposedly, 'solely in light of the disappointing financial performance of the company' and of course absolutely nothing to do with the growing criticism of Dow's stance on Bhopal. Some on the &lt;a href="http://dowethics.com/r/about/corp/newleader.htm"&gt;internet put a different spin&lt;/a&gt; on events...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Dow has a new CEO - William S. Stavropoulos. A change is good, it allows for a change or heart. William should know all about Bhopal as he masterminded the merger with Union Carbide. However since taking over he has been very silent on the issue of Bhopal. He seems mostly concerned with Dow's falling stock price. So we will definately be paying him a visit or two to demonstrate that resloving the issue of Bhopal would give him lots more time to concentrate on counting the corporate pennies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more unconventional interventions whenever William puts in a public apperance....&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Brazil's golden opportunity: staying GE-free</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/brazil-can-be-ge-free/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Too much to lose if Monsanto's GE crops are legalised in Brazil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The commercial growing of genetically engineered (GE) crops in Brazil has been blocked by legal injunctions for several years now. Crucial decisions about these injunctions  might be made in the few next weeks. Agrochemical giant Monsanto is ready to flood the Brazilian market with its GE seeds if legal approval is granted. Brazil has much to lose by allowing these crops and much to gain by keeping Monsanto out of its fields and remaining the world's major non-GE soya producer.

        &lt;p&gt;
            GE-free soya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight over the introduction of GE soya in Brazil has been
going on for five years, since Monsanto first won approval for its
Roundup Ready soybeans from the government's biosafety board,
CTNBio, in 1998. In the same year, a lawsuit was filed by
Greenpeace and the Brazilian Consumer Defense Institute (IDEC) to
prevent the commercial release of GE crops. Several preliminary
orders and a historic sentence issued by Federal Judge Antonio
Prudente in June 2000, ordered the government to introduce
standards and carry out complete environmental and health impact
studies. Implementation of full traceability and labelling rules by
the federal government were requested as a prerequisit of any
commercial GMO releases. Current Brazilian labelling rules do not
comply with these requests, since the decree issued in July 2001
only requires products with more than 4 percent GE content to be
labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Regional Federal Court headquarted in Brasília first
addressed the issue in February 2002, but, as of today only one of
a three-strong panel of federal judges has given an opinion. While
she favours lifting the injunctions that were imposed in 1998, the
two other judges haven't yet voiced their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a newly-elected government in place, the political climate
in Brazil is becoming less favourable for GE agriculture. The new
environment minister, Marina Silva, asked the federal advocate
general to suspend the outstanding ruling scheduled for mid
February, stating that the new government needed more time to
re-examine the issue. No decision on this request has yet been
made. Questioned shortly before the elections in October 2002,
President Luis Inacio 'Lula' da Silva said he favoured a commercial
moratorium as long as there continues to be no scientific consensus
on the safety of GE crops and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety
has not been ratified. The Protocol controls the transportation
across borders, handling and use of any GE organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's GE seeds have already caused some contamination of
Brazilian soya. The GE seeds were illegally imported to the
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul from neighbouring Argentina.
However, the original suspension of Monsanto's GE soybean sales is
still in place and the sale of the seeds or the use in food
products remains illegal in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;GE crops: a lose, lose proposition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE crops pose serious threats to the environment and human and
animal health. Genetic contamination through outcrossing or during
transport and handling has the potential to be a problem that
multiplies as plants grow and reproduce. In addition, there are
economic concerns connected with the introduction of these
crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil has a golden opportunity to take advantage of its status
as a top world soya producer that does not allow GE crops. Brazil's
non-GE status has already gained the country market shares and
premiums because of the increased demand for GE-free food. While
Brazil was able to extend its market in Europe in recent years,
demand for US and Argentine exports fell sharply since the
introduction of GE soya. Brazilian exporters can expect further
increases in demand with growing interest from the Asian market,
where GE foods are more and more seen as a matter of concern. In
Europe, tightened legislation on GE labelling and traceability is
coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If GE crops are legalised in Brazil, in addition to dwindling
markets, farmers will suffer because of herbicide resistance
problems, increased use of chemicals, and loss of control of seeds.
There is a wide gap between the GE-industry's fanfare of promises
and the actual realities of decreased yields and increased
herbicide use with Roundup Ready soya. Herbicide resistant weeds
are another problem that farmers growing GE crops are faced with.
The take-over of the seed market by a handful of GE industry giants
such as Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta not only affects the farmers'
right to save and exchange seeds, it also considerably reduces
agricultural biodiversity since these companies focus on a few
high-yielding varieties. Brazilian organisations of small farmers
have repeatedly voiced their opposition to GE agriculture. And they
have good reason. Farmers in North America have been battling an
array of GE induced problems: herbicide tolerant weeds, corporate
control and loss of foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers will lose if GE crops are legalised in Brazil because
of potential health risks of GE food. Current Brazilian labelling
laws would not give consumers full information about what they eat.
Consumers would not have the right to say "no" to GE products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network of seven Brazilian NGOs, including Greenpeace,
ActionAid and IDEC, are campaigning for a GE-free Brazil. A recent
opinion poll conducted on behalf of the NGO network shows support
from a majority of Brazilian consumers: more than 70 percent reject
GE foods, 65 percent are in favour of a moratorium on the
commercial growing of GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Prevention: the best solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only beneficiaries of GE crops in Brazil would be a handful
of transnational agrochemical companies like Monsanto, Syngenta or
Bayer. The precautionary approach to stay GE free offers only
advantages. Brazil can increase market shares as non-GE produce is
increasingly requested, environmental harm is prevented, and farmer
and consumer interests are protected. To this end, we are calling
on the decision-makers involved to decide in favour Brazil keeping
its non-GE status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Hester, a native Netherlander, usually works in the Greenpeace
video library in Amsterdam, where she spends her days cataloguing,
filing, sorting, copying and shipping Greenpeace videos. This is
her first time as a crewmember.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday the 27th was supposed to be the day I joined the Rainbow
Warrior but it turned out getting to Cardiff was a adventure in
itself: it was the Day of "The Storm" (one of the worst this part
of the world had seen in a while), so my flight was cancelled which
I found out after spending only 2 hrs in line at Amsterdam's
airport!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoned the captain to find out if the ship was going anywhere
else but he told me the weather was too bad anyway so they would
wait for me. I felt very privileged. So I went back home and did it
all again the next morning. The plane did fly this time but not
with our luggage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to wait for the next plane to see if my rucksack would be on
and luckily John ("the man with the plan" and the car) and I were
offered a cup of tea and a chat at the Rescue Boat Centre. Real
nice guys with great stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warrior had to leave the harbour because of the tides and
the rib (Rigid Inflatable Boat) came and picked me (and a crate of
lettuce and fresh bread) up. On the boat I met the first of the
crew, Dimitri and Jens, and soon we were racing to the Warrior! I
made it! Yippee! Watch out you dirty decks; I am coming over for
some good cleaning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea was not too bad and we sailed off (I think in a Southern
direction) on our way to spot the dolphins. Not for me though: I
had to go below deck to the hold, and got my first mission from
the, by now, world famous Simon the Bosun - make bike locks and
chains. Great: the real stuff; make something out of nothing. True
recycling. So Louise (UK Video person, now deckhand/volunteer)and
me started, wondering how seasick we would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took Louise 1.5 hrs; then she looked like she had seen and
spoken to a ghost. So I stayed below working away on my locks and
thinking about seasickness. I guess that is one of the problems
with this: you just can't think about anything else. I must say I
was not feeling too bad so I decided not to get sick. I couldn't
eat and I wasn't in a beer-drinking-and-joke-telling-mood but I
stayed pretty OK. (Must have inherited my dad's sea legs). Went to
bed really early though - 20:30!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following days I finished my bike locks and learned a lot
about the typical boat terminology, which has a lot of Dutch words
as origin. In the mess room there is a paper on the wall that
describes the Dutch Code of Discipline (and since all GP ships are
Dutch registered....it applies to us too:-), " ...Any fight that
drew blood would result in the antagonist having one hand strapped
behind his back and the other nailed to the mast. There he would
remain until he tore himself loose. If the fight ended in death the
man was bound to his victim and tossed into the sea. Refusing to
obey the captain commanded the death penalty... and the most
serious offences were dealt with by Keelhauling - which involved
being hauled underneath the keel while the ship was moving. In the
majority of cases, the victims head was ripped off". I am happy
Greenpeace is a non-violent organisation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after 2 days of cleaning, painting and grinding we saw the
first dolphins! They came straight for us from a distance and
hitched a ride. Common dolphins, 20 or so in a group. You can
actually hear them too! I have filmed them but missed the best shot
where one jumped out of the water! Damn. Not so easy to be a
wildlife videographer eh?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrive at St. Ives. Looks like a very pretty town and it
turns out to be really picturesque. I get to be crew on the rib
when we pick up 2 local journalists who will do an item on Whale
and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) and us for the 6 o'clock
news. So we race ashore and pick them up. They want some good shots
of the RW so we race around the boat. We have to do it again, now a
bit slower because it is not that easy to film from an inflatable.
I notice that myself when I take my camera out on the return trip;
it is hard enough to stay in the boat yourself, let alone get a
steady shot of the Warrior!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dima (Dimitri) and I sail into the little port of St Ives,
a seal pops up right next to our inflatable. He watches us with
this irritated look on his face as if he just missed a juicy fish
because we chased it away with our boat! I also missed that shot by
the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to go ashore on Hallowe'en night (never knew that that is
the proper way of spelling it, but I see it in all the newspapers
so I will do the apostrophe too now). But getting to shore it is
harder then I thought: the tides are low and we need to wade
through the water to get to land. Apparently, that is how St. Ives
got here as well so we feel OK about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out St Ives is a beautiful little seaside village with
lots of cute houses and shops and, of course, pubs. It is raining
so that is where we end up; in the pub. There is a raffle on and
they have some great things on auction: 6-packs of beer, t-shirts,
a diner voucher, vegetables and chocolate. But the best things are
the three novelty cakes: shaped in 'funny' forms like a bra and
men's underwear. We decide to bet on a cake in the shape of a
woman's bottom, with suspenders and all! We call it the Arse cake
and we end up buying it for 17 pounds! It could have been a lot
cheaper if Simon (different Simon this time) would not have been
bidding against his colleague Phaedre, but anyway; the money goes
to charity and the cakes come with us! Amber (WDCS) then went on a
quest ("have to have pumpkin-have to have pumpkin!' ) so when she
returned with 2 (kindly donated by the restaurant owner who
couldn't resist Amber's puppy-eyed request) we know the Hallowe'en
night is a success. At 11 o' clock Derek comes to pick us (and our
trophies) up with the rib, and the next night we all have a piece
of arse cake after dinner! Thank you St. Ives!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In St. Ives we also say goodbye to some Whale and Dolphin
Conservation Society people and trade them for fresh ones. The
girls and boys from the WDCS are on constant watch on the corners
of the deck and the bow. On watch to spot the dolphins. Not a lot
of them around though.... But Simon has seen a basking shark!
Pretty amazing; I didn't know they would be here. And the other day
Lowri saw a Sunfish right next to the boat! The things you learn on
a trip like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the days were quite slow on the dolphin side of
things: I didn't see anymore and the rest of the crew only saw a
couple of porpoises. We are on our way to the Isles of Scilly and
it should be better there. If we ever make it that far though; the
weather forecasts are not so good and it can be really rough on the
English Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it is! Bloody H*** what a ride! Much better then most
cakewalks at the fair this! Our boat is rocking and rolling (yeah
baby yeah!) and the waves are 5 to 8 meters high! Dark blue with
some splashing white heads on them, rising high next to us and in
front of us and, well, basically we are surrounded by them! The
porthole doors (the ones on the inside) are closed and some
cupboards are starting to feel seasick too and spit out their
belongings so I tape them shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Andrea, the cooks assistant; she is definitely not feeling
well in this weather. But this is exceptionally rough; the biggest
wave is around 10 meters high so we can hardly walk and a lot of
people are in bed. Even Meredith and Ellie who both have never been
sick, have had their share. (Ok: she had to clean the compost
barrel, which isn't very helpful I guess). It is exciting and I am
curious to see if it will effect me so I eat a whole bar of
chocolate after lunch and wait. But nothing happens. I don't get
sick, I just feel a bit funny. It must be the years of Rock 'n Roll
that prepared me for this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way back from the Scilly Islands and we are
still rolling around on the waves. I have a couple of hours off
right now because I am working at night - putting no-slip
protection on the alleyway floors while everyone else is asleep. I
like being a deckhand!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night we sailed into French waters after ten days working
in Spain with excellent volunteers and campaigners resulting in two
actions, two press conferences and a lot of media attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first action was a bit of a "beating on arrival" sort of
thing. Our aim was to stop the loading of trucks in a cement
factory on the coastal town of Carboneras. Holcim, the Swiss cement
company, wants to fuel cement production with industrial ( = toxic
) waste. We wanted to get media attention on this otherwise very
discrete, big money, business deal that has long lasting pollution
as the unaccounted for side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning, we run into the factory, our Spanish colleagues
already had blocked the main entrance and got arrested just before
we come in, the place is crowded by Guardia civil (civilian police)
and except for our man Remon - three cheers for him - none of our
eight activists makes it over the gate. The police are well trained
in dealing with unwelcome immigrants, and we do feel that. Ai!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour on the concrete outside the factory, face down,
or for Gian Luca, face up in the hot sun of southern Spain. That's
what you get when you stir up the crowd for a second run. After our
time on the concrete we are, for eight hours, in the company of
beer drinking and chain-smoking policemen in an old garage next to
the station; there is no other place to put the thirty lose
elements (us).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ten, when almost everybody finally has gone through the full
procedure of giving shoe sizes, fingerprints and having our
pictures taken (from the front and side), a last bit of confusion
starts. The policemen count and count us again but miss one person.
Where is William? Mm, we know where Bill is. Bill asked the right
person whether he was released now and left and got himself a beer
at the pub opposite the police station. But here the show isn't
over till it is really over, Bill has to come in again, we wait
another little while for another final procedure. And then we all
have a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it was for me the shortest action I ever participated
in, it was a successful one because of the great interest of the
media. Now, questions are rising about the plan to burn toxic waste
to make cement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another town and another action. Tarragona is a
town only an hours train ride from Barcelona. Barcelona is the city
after which the convention to protect the Mediterranean from
further pollution is called. The Barcelona Convention, so close,
and implementation? So far away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in Tarragona, stands the only official hazardous waste
incinerator in Spain, where people burn industrial waste. The idea
of making waste disappear by burning it is a myth. For every three
tons of garbage an average of one ton of ashes is produced, highly
concentrated with pollutants such as heavy metals and PCB's. This
ash becomes landfilled so that it leaches into the earth and the
groundwater freely, or is, for example, mixed with cement that in
the long run it has the same effect. Toxic gases spread out and
create higher percentages of illnesses such as cancer and diabetes
in areas around incineration plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the overall costs, incineration is not even
economically sustainable and fuels dirty industries to do their
business as usual. There are job-creating, environment saving ways
to deal with the problem of waste: reuse, reduce, and recycle. And
that is why we blocked the Tarragona plant for a big part of
Tuesday, met up with way friendlier police than in the south,
waited and looked at many slogans on the walls of the very smelly
jail, added some of our own, finally got released, and celebrated
the positive press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the ship. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

	As we sailed into the Mediterranean Sea a few weeks ago, the first thing that struck me was all the garbage floating around the ship.  We were starting to identify the often sighted bottle-fish and plastic bag-turtles between beautiful pilot whales and dolphins. It's really not funny at all. It's the sad story of the Mediterranean.
&lt;div&gt;

            Amanda, Greenpeace cook for the MV Esperanza.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that after seeing so much waste in the sea there
would not be too much left elsewhere, but there is. Many of the
countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea have no working system
for recycling and reducing the waste they produce. So they burn
it!! This is creating even more problems with dangerous
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our ships we have very careful waste management and we live
by the words: reduce, reuse, recycle. Beautiful words and a
necessity for clean living not only on this ship but also on the
planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are presently in Tarragona in Spain, about a one-hour train
ride from Barcelona. We are here to create awareness, to spread
information about how toxics get released into nature, and
hopefully to inspire people to act against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a number of open-ship days, and Sunday at one point
as I looked out from the ship there was a loooong line of people
waiting to come and see our ship and hear about our work.
Brilliant!! There are some wonderful, hardworking Spanish
volunteers here to help us show people around and to tell them
about the ship and our work. Usually this is something I love to do
myself but my Spanish is more or less limited to "Ya soy la
cusinera" (I am the cook) and I'm afraid I won't inspire anyone
with those words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday (October 22) was a different kind of day; Greenpeace
made a non-violent direct action (as we often do) at the Constantí
incinerator in Tarragona, Spain. Thirty-three activists blocked the
gates. This place is a good example of a bad thing: these monstrous
burners should not be allowed. The air is filled with a strong
toxic smell, there is even a sign that warns of radioactive
waste(!!) and everything but the kitchen sink is getting
burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toxin-filled smoke is released into the air and the ashes
into the soil. The toxins now have an easy way to reach the ground
waters as well and - voila! -- they have managed to pollute every
element of the nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is in these emissions, one might ask? Well some
substances identified in smoke and waste from incinerators are
heavy metals, PCBs and dioxin, just to give a brief picture. And it
is not a pretty picture. These toxic substances are going straight
into the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can the politicians here live with this system? Some people
even promote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;incinerators as a green option to solve the growing waste
problem created by modern living. But you do not get rid of it. You
create an even bigger problem and greater health problems. All when
the solution quite easy. We need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Reduce Reuse Recycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ship we have our trash cleaned out, compressed and
sorted, but our garbage space is getting full and we need to get
rid of some of it so we asked a police officer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who was passing by the ship, if he knew of a way we could
responsibly dispose of it. He answered: there's an incinerator just
a bit away from here. Well, I don't think so!!!&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists are celebrating Spanish nuclear regulators' "death sentence" for the Jose Cabrera plant in Zorita, that nation's oldest nuclear reactor. But the landmark September decision did not come easily. Ageing and ailing though they may be, Spain's nuclear reactors have lofty friends.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/greenpeace-activists-on-the-do.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/greenpeace-activists-on-the-do.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists on the dome of the Zorita nuclear power plant.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governing Partido Popular party has strongly promoted people
like Loyola de Palacio and Teresa Estavan Bolea, people who want
you forget this is a dangerous, expensive and polluting
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Palacio's fervent pro-nuclear message resonates far beyond
Spain. She uses her position as EU Energy Commissioner and Vice
President to boost nuclear power as a way to tackle climate change.
She doesn't seem to understand that substituting one disaster for
another is hardly a solution; in May she proudly cheered Findland's
logic-defying decision to build a new reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back on Spanish soil the unabashedly pro-nuclear
Estavan Bolea uses her position as Chair of the Spanish Nuclear
Safety Council (known by its Spanish acronym CSN) to try to soften
nuclear legislation, and promote like-minded people to key
technical decision-making positions in the Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain has no new reactors planned, so Estavan Bolea concentrates
her efforts on breathing new life into current plants, hoping to
extend their lifespan to 60 years. She fought fiercely and
unilaterally to add an extra ten years to the operating license of
the 34-year-old Zorita plant, located 50 kilometres northeast of
Madrid. Operated by the Union Fenosa power company, it has
technical problems, including rust and cracks in its reactor
vessel, and has released radioactive material into the air, toward
the nearby Tajo River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Estavan Bolea proved no match for opposition to the obsolete
plant, which included Greenpeace and other social and political
groups. One highlight was the widely-reported April storming of the
plant by six Greenpeace activists. They scaled its dome to protest
the plant's decrepit state and highlight security risks. A CSN
investigation into the plant followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landmark September decision marks the first scheduled
closure of a Spanish nuclear plant for technical and safety
reasons. The affair put Estavan Bolea's obvious pro-nuclear bias
under the spotlight, as her shameless pro-nuclear song dragged the
CSN's reputation to historic lows. A regulatory body controlling an
industry as dangerous as nuclear power must base its decisions on
technical realities, not political motives. The CSN urgently
requires legal reform, increased transparency and citizen
participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dark cloud for activists is the CSN decision to allow the
Zorita plant to operate until 2006, prolonging its risk to public
health and the environment. Still, the reactor's death sentence
should give pro-nuclear forces pause before they attempt to prop up
other ageing Spanish reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

	A tasty fish with a toothy grin is prized loot for modern pirates. With a market value of US$10 a kilogram, toothfish are on the losing end of a massive international and illegal treasure hunt. Even member countries of the regional conservation commission have joined the hunt while the fish stocks verge on collapse.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/patagonian-toothfish-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Patagonian toothfish
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year as they swim the deep blue waters off the South
American andSubantarctic continental shelves they are met by a
massive attack frompirate fishers. More than half of toothfish are
illegally caught. Forfish that don't breed till they are about ten
years old, this severeoverexploitation is devastating for the
species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toothfish can live to be 50 years old, but their chances of
reachingthis ripe old age are growing slimmer. Once their
ratherferocious-looking heads are removed and their bodies cleaned
andde-scaled, the moist, oily white flesh of Patagonian and
Antarctictoothfish becomes a delicacy that can fetch more than
US$10/kg amongthe trendy dining crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before plunging their forks in, fish-lovers might want to
knowtheir meal is actually the victim of a massive international
andillegal resource grab by pirate fishers. Experts say that if
thisplunder goes unchecked, stocks of Patagonian toothfish, also
known asChilean Sea Bass, will collapse by 2010 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What's our name today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this exploitation is to glimpse into the shady,
shiftingworld of pirate fishers, where vessels' names and
nationalities changewith the seasons - or even the days. One
Greenpeace survey thatincluded 34 vessels found ten flag of
convenience (FOC) vessels, twowith no name at all, three vessels
with two names, two with the samename, 27 which displayed no
country or port or registry, and nine whichhad been sighted
previously engaged in illegal operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a fishery so openly and blatantly violated, finding
legitimate fishers is actually the more difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Pirate collaborators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Uruguay, Russia, Korea and Seychelles are the
ultimateaccomplices of these fish pirates. Vessels carrying these
countries'flags are fishing illegally within CCAMLR waters
(governed by theCommission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources)and are then laundering their catch through the
CCAMLR trade rules bylying about where they caught their fish. By
authorising catches forthese vessels, these countries are
undermining CCAMLR's management andsupporting pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Belize - still open for business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25843/99baclava.jpg" align="left" height="150" width="200"&gt;Belizewas the world's most
fish pirate friendly country and the biggestpirate player in the
toothfish fishery for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of December 2001, the nation had in its registry an
outrageouslylarge fleet for a tiny nation - 481 fishing vessels -
slightly biggerthan that of China. In a global survey of vessels
caught illegallyfishing, 50 percent were FOC, and 36 percent
carried the flag ofBelize. Cambodia, Bolivia and Equatorial Guinea
are other FOC countriesthat have increased their fleets since 1999.
Greenpeace has chased twopirate fishing vessels with the Belize
flag out of the Southern ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Belize announced it was getting out of the dirty flag
ofconvenience fishing business, ditching five notorious fishing
piratesfrom its shipping register, buckling under pressure from
Greenpeace andgovernments. However, only two weeks ago another
Belize-flagged pirate,Noemi, turned up in Mozambique to offload
toothfish. So much forgetting out of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Growing problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures have been taken to control the illegal goldrush on
Patagonianand Antarctic toothfish. Yet illegal, unreported and
unregulatedfishing rose by at least 30 percent in 2001 according to
CCAMLR, theregional body responsible for toothfish
conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major problem is that many nations fishing, trading
andimporting toothfish are not members of the CCAMLR club, and so
considerthemselves exempt from its rules. CCAMLR has 24 members,
but there are57 nations in some way involved in the toothfish
trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A wake up call for the CCAMLR club&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is not just those countries outside the conservation
commissionthat flaunt the rules. Some CCAMLR members are also
involved in theillegal toothfishery. Vessels of three members and
of observerSeychelles are lying about where they catch
toothfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two and a half years vessels from Russia, Uruguay
andKorea have stolen 13,799 tonnes, (US$150 million) of toothfish
fromCCAMLR waters, in addition to their legal catches. Vessels from
theSeychelles took 7,433 tonnes (US$72 million) during that
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, by laundering their catches through CCAMLR's
catchdocumentation scheme, pirates can demand higher prices for the
fishthey catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since May 2000, vessels from these countries have plundered
CCAMLRsub-Antarctic waters for over $200 million. We believe much
of thecatch was taken from Australian, French and South African
territorialwaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more lucrative scam than drug trafficking, and the
toothfish and seabird populations pay the penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Winged by-catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25843/0932050216.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150"&gt;There'sa sorry subplot to
the toothfish story. As fish pirates empty the seas,they also empty
the skies. When fishing vessels run up to 20,000 baitedhooks off
their sterns, sea birds swoop in to grab the bait but mayalso
swallow the hooks and be pulled under water and drowned. As manyas
93,000 seabirds were caught and drowned on the lines of
illegal,unreported and unregulated fishers' longlines during the
2000-01 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes endangered species of albatross, the world's
largestseabirds. These great ocean wanderers have a wingspan of up
to 3.5metres and live up to 85 years, mating for life. Some, such
as theAmsterdam albatross which numbers only 10 to 16 pairs, are
declining sorapidly they are on the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Mending holes in the regulatory net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important solution could make use of a United Nations treaty
thatregulates international trade in plant and animals products,
theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major loophole could be closed by listing toothfish under
CITESAppendix II. This could effectively close off trade routes
throughcountries which are not members of CCAMLR by extending its
rules tothese countries through CITES. It would also cut off
laundering schemesdevised by the fish pirates since CCAMLR began to
take steps to tightenthe toothfish trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This puts lucrative markets driving the gold rush toothfish
fishery out of the pirates' reach.&lt;/p&gt;

            Lucy on board the Rainbow Warrior
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, 9th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aberystwyth, despite being unpronounceable to at least 98
percent of the global population, turned out to be a pretty nice
town. I had spent the last couple of weeks having conversations
with the Greenpeace Crew Manager that went along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Tanya, where shall I meet the ship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Aber er..er abersinthwit or something um pardon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aber..oh god Absynth-thingy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absynth-who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets just call it the A-place. It's in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So having survived Birmingham and a three hour train ride
through the gorgeous green and lumpy Welsh countryside, it came as
quite a relief last night to finally see the Rainbow Warrior, my
home for the next 16 days, anchored off the Welsh coast. I had
obviously found the right, A-place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, John the logistics coordinator and general
man-with-a-plan had it all under control from then on. At
Aberystwyth Marina, we met up with the five scientists from the
Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society who were coming on board to
carry out a five week survey of cetaceans, that's whales and
dolphins, along the welsh coast. They had a huge pile of equipment
which we helped cart down the jetty on trolleys. As I pushed my
heavy trolley down the steep slope, it took on a life of its own
and made a bid for freedom towards the murky waters beneath.
Luckily, a few of us together managed to restrain it and prevent
the survey equipment from a cold swim. It would not have been a
good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my first time on board the Rainbow Warrior. Although I
have been working for Greenpeace for three years, I have never
actually made it on board our international superstar flagship
before. As our rib (rigged hulled inflatable boat) pulled up
alongside the familiar white-on-green Greenpeace logo, I noticed
that everyone in our little troupe of RW novices was grinning with
excitement. It felt like we were climbing on board a celebrity.
This is a ship that has inspired people around the world, that was
rammed and stormed by French commandos while it was opposing
nuclear testing, that this year opposed a nuclear waste shipment
and protested against forest destruction...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I toppled dreamily overboard in a fit of nostalgia, I was
brought back down to earth - or rather sea - by George, the first
mate. There was a list of things that we needed to know about life
on board that we should learn fast if we were to avoid being made
to walk the plank by the rest of the crew. Most important was
water. Despite being surrounded on all sides by the stuff, fresh
water is in short supply on ships. So long hot Radox baths are out.
ONE shower a day said George, in capital letters, TWO minutes only
each time. I nod and try and look tough and rugged, a bit like Xena
Warrior Princess. I can tell its not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on board we meet the rest of the crew and Derek, the
Captain, who has been a Greenpeace captain for seven years. We are
given a tour of the ship from Claire the Radio Operator and High
Priestess of Teccie-ness and on the way we meet Dave the Dolphin -
a wooden carving that sits on the Bow (the front of the ship) that
was donated to us by a sculptor in Germany. Legend has it that he
hid a time capsule inside Dave, with messages of hope for the
future. We also meet a small and scary ceramic gnome with no nose
that lives on the bridge (the place from which the Captain and
mates steer the ship). Ruth, one of the other deckhands, appears to
be quite attached to him, but I think he has evil eyes and should
be thrown overboard immediately. He definitely looks
suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some great food prepared by the ship cook, Marco, we head
down to our cabin to make up our beds. I clamber into a top bunk
and get rocked to sleep by the gentle swell. It is only 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 10th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/sunrise.jpg" alt="Sunrise." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;At 7:30 we get a wake up call from the crew member
who has been on watch duty. We groan a bit, but in fact three of us
have been awake for at least an hour, paranoid about missing the
call and getting in trouble for oversleeping on the first
morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always have a problem getting out of bed, but this morning the
problem took on a whole new dimension since I had to figure out a
way to get out of my high bunk, which has wooden walls around the
sides to stop you falling out if the weather gets rough. It was
pretty easy to get into, but manoeuvring yourself over the wall and
down to the floor is more tricky, especially with your eyes sticky
and ankles and knees stiff from a night of sleeping. I jump and
crash to the ground. If the boat sinks because of an inexplicably
shaped hole in the cabin floor then you know who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eat breakfast and at eight I report to Simon the Bosun, who
is the deckhand's boss and therefore master of my life over the
next couple of weeks. Despite the many horror stories I have heard
about cruel and evil bosuns who work their deckhands to pulp, Simon
turns out to be a very nice guy with no cat-o-nine-tails
immediately obvious. (Yes, I know. Of course, I would say that
that, since I have another two weeks left on the boat under his
command. But honestly, he seems like a very reasonable man. And if
at any time during the rest of this diary it sounds like I'm
sucking up to him, then it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the
fact that he is my boss. Really.) So anyway, charming and handsome
Simon tells me to start by helping out with the cleaning that
happens every day between eight and 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six other deckhands - Henri, Ruth, Mariana, Ed, Will
and Meredith - and they are all walking around in overalls and
t-shirts covered in paint and grease stains, like badges of honour.
Next to them, my old but clean jeans and sweater look pretty
amateur. Luckily I find some 5th hand overalls in the hold (bottom
of the ship) which are pre-splattered with vast amounts of grease
and paint. In fact, they are more paint than material. I put them
on and feel immediately better. I feel as if I have been working
incredibly hard for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back to the mess (that's the room we eat in) I am
slightly concerned to find the other deckhands vying over who gets
to clean the toilets. Apparently it's one of the better jobs. This
is not a good sign. Figuring that as the most junior deckhand on
board I have absolutely no chance of winning the toilet cleaning
contest, I look around for something else to do and one of the
deckhands explains to me about the garbage system on the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every tiny piece of rubbish on board is separated: glass,
plastic, aluminium, paper and organic waste all get sorted into
different bins so that as much as possible can be re-used or
recycled. The person in charge of all this is called the Chief
Garbologist, a position which I immediately aspire to just because
the name is so great. I help clean the pantry and the wet room, and
then go back to Simon for more tasks. He sends me down to the
engine room to do some painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine room, in the belly of the ship, is hot, noisy and
smells strongly of, well, engines I guess. We have to put ear
protection on before going in because the noise is so loud. It's
bizarre, because the ear masks distort and magnify the sounds that
your own body makes, a bit like going under water. If you swallow,
it sounds like someone has just flushed a toilet. If you yawn, it
sounds like a running tap. Or perhaps that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine room is being painted all the colours of the rainbow,
and I wonder if this is Greenpeace just taking it a bit too far.
But Mario, Chief Engineer, explains to me that this is standard
practice on ships, with different pipes being painted different
colours according to what they carry. Blue pipes carry cooling
water. Green pipes carry seawater. It makes sense. After a coffee
break at ten, we add face masks (to protect us from breathing the
fumes) to our ear protectors and begin to look more like extras in
Dr. Who than Greenpeace deckhands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch is at 12 and, as with all the food so far, is fantastic.
Marco, the cook, manages to create options for vegetarians and
vegans as well as meat eaters. It makes a huge difference to have
meals that you really look forward to. Everyone eats together in
the mess, and everyone does their own washing up in the pantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/scientists.jpg" alt="Research." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;In the afternoon, Simon lets me help out the guys
from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS from now on)
with their research (can the flattery be working already?). This
afternoon they are setting up equipment and checking their
methodology. I am asked to take up a survey position on one side of
the boat and to section of sea for any sign of dolphin and
porpoises. What's the difference? I ask Mark, the Science Director
of WDCS. He tells me that in this part of the world, dolphins are
bigger than porpoises and porpoises have different teeth and fins
to dolphins. They also behave quite differently: Harbour porpoises
are more shy and you are only likely to get a quick glimpse of
them, often hiding behind a wave. Bottlenose dolphins are much more
likely to come and investigate a passing ship and see what s going
on. Bottlenose dolphins also have the habit of Bow riding. That's
when they swim alongside the front of the boat and use the water
currents caused by the ships movement to push them along. Basically
they hitch a free ride. It looks like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stand at my post and look. And look. I don t see anything.
Apart from sea. It's weird, because if you stare at the sea for
long enough it starts to look different. It's like one of those 3-D
pictures that you have to stare at for 20 minutes, before the
ziggly lines turn into a picture of the Coliseum. Or Jane Fonda.
The sea stops being an endless mass of the same thing and you start
to see patterns and details. It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/dolphin.jpg" alt="Just visiting." width="135" height="180" hspace="3" align="right"&gt;After an hour or so of looking there's a shout from
the other side of the boat. Three bottleneck dolphins are bow
riding! We all leg-it up to the front of the boat and look down at
them swimming effortlessly along - surfacing and diving back down
and surfacing gracefully again. It's magical. This is what we are
all here for. The dolphins stay with us for a few minutes and then
suddenly they are gone. Just like that. We look and look, hoping
they'll come back, but they have obviously lost interest in us.
Perhaps we'll see them again later on in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another hour or so its raining and cold and even my
Peruvian balaclava cannot protect me from the cold any longer. I
head inside and warm up. I'll be in bed soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 11th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day starts like yesterday, with a 7:30 wake up call and a
sleepy breakfast. Today I am shown how to clean the toilets (or
Heads as they are called on ships. I haven t figured out why yet. I
hope it hasn't got anything to do with the frequency of throwing
up). Then its back down to the engine room, this time for some
serious scrubbing. We have to prepare some walls for painting, but
they are behind a whole load of pipes and equipment and they are
difficult to reach. Its dirty work and by 11 am Henri and I have
aching necks and shoulders from contorting ourselves into strange
positions. Just then, George comes down to find us to let us know
that there are bottlenoses bow riding again. We race upstairs and
arrive just in time to see them disappear again. They're here and
then they re gone again said Will, fellow deckhand like Keizer
Soese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/mark.jpg" alt="Mark." width="135" height="180" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;In
the afternoon I'm back in position surveying the sea, just off
Aberystwyth. Mark has had his hat stolen by the wind and is mildly
distraught, since it had sentimental value. "I have two spares
though", he confided. It's cold and we are being spat at by the
rain, but I have a Greenpeace survival suit on and feel invincible,
in a telly-tubby kind of way. But I don't see much and after a
couple of hours head back into the warmth of the mess to drink hot
ribena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go for a nap at seven, with the full intention of getting up
again in an hour or so. Ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, 12th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up at about four being thrown about in my bunk. The sea is
getting frisky. Half an hour later I hear an extremely loud Clang
Clang Clang and wonder if this is what sinking sounds like. I
realise slowly that it is the anchor being hauled up, which means
that we are on the move. The waves are so strong that we are being
dragged towards the shore. We need to find calmer waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try and breathe with the movement of my bunk and focus on
taking each wave as it comes. In my sleepiness I know that I should
take a sea-sickness tablet, but they are in my cupboard, which
means getting out of bed. And getting out of bed means taking a
flying leap into the darkness and onto a moving target (the floor).
I feel that as long as I stay in the safety of my bunk, I'll be
OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at 7:30 the Knock comes and I have to get up. I have a bad
feeling about this. We are all thrown around as we struggle into
our clothes and head up to the mess. Breakfast is definitely out,
so I try to get on with the cleaning. But all I can manage is
putting away teaspoons because I feel hot and sweaty and dizzy. I
ask Henri as calmly as possible where I should throw up (there is
strict ship etiquette for this, I m sure) and she directs me to the
bucket in our cabin or the heads. I lurch down the corridor, trying
to smile at the Captain en route, and get as far as a toilet. You
can imagine the rest for yourselves, so I'll spare you the details.
Surprisingly, I feel better almost straight away and collapse
asleep on the day bed in our cabin. When I wake up a few hours
later, the sea is calm and the sun shiny. It's a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, 13th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day off for the crew. Watched movies in the mess and played
guitar. Food has taken on a whole new dimension since yesterday's
events, and I'm beginning to wonder if it really is such a blessing
to have a great cook on board. His lasagne smelled wonderful, but
it really takes the pleasure out of eating when you are wondering
whether you'll be seeing the food back again in a couple of hours
if there is rough weather. Some cruel sadist has even brought some
chocolate hobnob biscuits on board, surely the best food ever
invented in the history of mankind. The Temptation. But oh,the
Regret?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, 14th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about living on board a ship is that you have to learn
a whole new language. Apart from the terms "Port, Starboard, Stern
and Bow" which I learnt in the Brownies aged about six, I am a
total foreigner when it comes to nautical language. The crew eats,
drinks, plays chess and plots in the "mess". That's easy to
remember. I wonder which word came first - "mess" or "messy"? A
staircase is a "companionway", locks on outside doors are known as
"dogs" and "leech" is ship speak for the back edge of a sail. It's
all very confusing and only slightly less painful than learning
Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Manuel in Fawlty Towers lots of the time - I had a
conversation today that went something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what's going on: "Clip on the bow
line"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: "Uhh?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what's going on: "The bow line"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (trying to say it in a more intelligent sounding way):
"Uhh?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what is going on and being very
patient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, not the one with the Monkey's Fist. The other one."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (Confused. Then experiencing moment of dull comprehension,
like the chimps in 2001: Space Odyssey): "Uhhhh!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what is going on: "OK, now release the
Elephant Nozzle"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: "Uhhh???"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on. Sometimes I wonder if they are making it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the Heads (which, if you have been paying attention
carefully, you will know means "toilet") there is a glossary of
ship speak on the wall, presumably for us to study during quiet
solitary moments. I figure that this will be the solution to all my
problems. Until I attempt to read it. A "Baggy Wrinkle", it tells
me, "prevents sails from chafing on shrouds". And a "Preventer:
prevents gaff from swinging inboard". Whose shroud? Whose gaff?
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?? I resolve to keep quiet and just nod and
smile a lot from now on. That usually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a happy afternoon taking winches apart in order to
grease them. They are quite tricky since they have all sorts of
springs and ball bearings which are liable to jump out and spring
or roll away across the deck into the great unknown. Luckily Ed, a
fellow deckhand, knows what he is doing and warns me about the
dangers. Ed even knows how to put the winches back together again,
which is more than can be said for me. Though since there are 21
winches on board, all of which have to be greased, I guess I will
learn sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up having another early night - 10pm seems late around
here. As I climb up into my bunk, it hits me that our cabin feels a
bit like being at a boarding school. Or rather a weird cross
between boarding school, boot camp and Glastonbury all at the same
time. Four girls share the cabin, which has two bunk beds, a sink,
a small table and a big stereo. We each have a cupboard to put our
stuff in, and the other cupboards house towels and sheets for the
rest of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are scary notices on the wall which warn us not to run in
the alleyways, not to talk loudly in the alleyways, not to slam
doors and not to shower between 7:30 and 9am. There is actually
good reason for all of this: ships work 24 hours a day since
someone always has to be on watch, which means that there is also
someone sleeping at any time in the day. It's hard to remember when
you get (or, in my case, jump with flailing arms) out of bed in the
morning that somebody has been on watch from four until eight and
is probably just settling down to get some well-earned kip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also lots of stickers on the walls with campaign
slogans and "I woz here" messages from former inhabitants of our
bunks. Its great tracing the history of the ship and the people who
have been on board back through the sticker graffiti. As I snooze,
I wonder about the scores of activists and Greenpeacers who have
lain in exactly the same bunk over the last 13 years, and the
stories that they could tell. Unfortunately, I find myself getting
distracted by the question of the square meter area that would be
covered by their aggregate beards. I'm going to have nightmares.
It's time to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, 16th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bleary-eyed morning starts with the news that Jan - one of
the WDCS researchers - decided to go for a swim at 6:30 this
morning. In the Irish Sea in mid October. She just jumped in. To me
the idea of immersing myself in icy water in the small hours is
only slightly less appealing than being slowly eaten alive by a
team of wombats, but others on board did a good job of pretending
not to be impressed by her barmy bathing behaviour. "Bit warm in
there for me," said Justin, "I like to break the ice when I go for
a dip". Fortunately, Jan is leaving the ship today so will not here
to make the rest of us feel inadequate for the rest of the
tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inflatable is going to take Jan and Justin ashore to return
their normal lives and I am allowed to go along for the ride. Simon
(remember him? He's the witty, strong, handsome one) is driving and
once we pull away from the ship we go pretty fast, bouncing along
on the waves with a light spray in our faces. At Pwllheli we drop
off Jan and Justin and collect Tom, another scientist, who is
coming on board for a couple of days. Heading back to the ship, we
thump up and down on the sea again and I feel the wind in my hair
and lick the salt from my lips. Life on the ocean wave feels pretty
good right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I help with painting the hold. The hold is a
big area in the belly of the ship where all sorts of things are
stored, including bikes, kayaks and of course hundreds of banners.
We are using this period of time in which there are no actions to
completely repaint this area from floor to ceiling. Allegedly this
is because we want it to look nice for "Open Boat" days - when we
open up the boat for the public to come on board to see the ship. I
happen to know that it is actually because Dimitri (2nd Mate) and
Mario (Chief Engineer) want to have a grand table-tennis hall in
which to wage their ping-pong battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I consider myself to be quite a careful person, within
20 minutes of starting painting I am about 90 percent covered in
paint. I have paint in my hair, paint on my shoes, all over my arms
and ...oooh, itchy eye... yep - paint all over my face. A nice grey
stripe across my eyebrow so that I suddenly bear more than a
passing resemblance to Adam Ant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by painting the floor, and then move onto the mast and
shelves. We have to squidge into all the nooks and crannies and the
contorted positions we end in up would make a yoga guru proud. When
we break for coffee, I spend half of the break trying to scrub the
paint off my hands. In the Mess there is a message on the
noticeboard saying "No bare hands on the Cheese". Apparently there
are literally fingerprints on the Edam. There was another notice
that read "No dirty working clothes in the Mess", but some bright
spark changed the "clothes" to "class" fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/bottlenose_dolphins.jpg" alt="Bottlenose dolphins." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;Later in the afternoon there is a shout that a
family of dolphins is bow-riding. There is the usual scramble to
get up to the front of the ship and about 18 bottle-noses are
swooshing elegantly through the water, criss-crossing each other's
paths and then falling in with each other's movements in perfect
synchrony. They hang around for about 15 minutes and then all
disappear together, in one movement, as if they are attached by
invisible threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight is the night that I finally get to wash my hair. I have
been saving up my two-minutes-per-day of shower credits, so I
reckon tonight I am entitled to up to six minutes of hot liquid
bliss. When I'm done and am feeling all new and shiny, Mark points
out to me that I still have large streaks of surf grey paint
covering about a sixth of my head. I decide not to worry about it.
At least its gloss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 17th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's back down to continue work on painting the hold. We are
bemused to find that a part of the floor that we didn't get round
to finishing yesterday is this morning wet with surf grey paint. It
turns out that Dimitri, frustrated by the slow progress towards the
completion of his ping-pong palace, came down here at 4:30am last
night to hurry things along a bit. I guess he must really like ping
pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the floor is still covered with a pile of ropes so we
need to move them to an already-painted area. They are arranged
into huge coils to keep them under control. You really do not want
to get one of these ropes tangled up - they are enormous and very
heavy - and unravelling a serious knot would probably take several
strong crew and a long time. I feed the ropes to Ed, who curls them
neatly into coils. Although it sounds easy enough, the weight of
the ropes make my puny shoulder-muscles ache. A bit pathetic I
know, but then again the diameter of the rope is about twice that
of my upper arm, so perhaps its excusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get on with covering the floor, shelves and ourselves with
paint throughout the day, singing along to Morcheeba and the
Levellers, which through our facemasks sounds like the noise a
vacuum cleaner makes when you suck up a sock by mistake. By the
time we've finished, Ping-Pong Paradise is looking pretty smart and
we are feeling quite proud of ourselves. Apart from the fact that
one of us always manages to forget about a wet bit of floor and
tread in it, so that there is always just a bit more rollering to
do to cover up the footprints. This continues
Laurel-and-Hardy-style for a while, so I wonder if we will ever
actually make it to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marco has cooked the best pizza in the history of Italian mamas,
and I wolf it down, pushing thoughts of tonight's dire gale
warnings as far into the back of my head as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 18th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After none of the predicted gales and a stunning sunrise, we
begin the morning's work as usual with half an hour of cleaning.
This morning I pick up the brush for cleaning the toilets with not
so much as a murmur of dissent from my fellow deckhands. The same
thing happened yesterday, and I am beginning to get suspicious.
Despite two consecutive days of toilet cleaning, I can't honestly
say that I have discovered the joy in it yet, and when I look back
to vying over the toilet cleaning during my first days on board
(first deckhand: "I'm cleaning the toilets", second deckhand: "No,
I am, I am" third deckhand "Ooooh let me, let me") I suspect that
this may well be a scam they pull on all naïve new deckhands. It
certainly worked on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/simon.jpg" alt="Simon investigates." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;There is a strange knocking noise coming from
somewhere below the ship, and the Captain is worried that we may
have something - perhaps a buoy or a lobster pot - snagged
underneath. Simon, our hero, volunteers to do some investigative
snorkelling, and becomes the second person in three days to leap
into the chilly waters of the Irish sea. When he surfaces again, he
reports that whatever it was has unsnagged itself: the lobster-pot
crisis has been averted and we can all return to our chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there is enough wind to put the sails up and the Warrior
looks fantastic with the white sails billowing in the wind. It's a
gorgeous day, with blue skies and bright white candyfloss clouds,
and I try and sneak in a few photos of the crew and scientists
between painting. There are lots of birds around - gannets,
kittewakes, razorbills, guillimots, and cormorants - which squawk
and soar and feed on great balls of fish in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's Friday night, and Will decides to organise a pub quiz to
make up for the fact that we can't get to a real pub tonight. My
team - the Randy Risso's - is coming a close second as we go into
the final round - the "name that dolphin fin" questions.
Unfortunately, since Will has chosen the . . . er . . lesser known
species such as the Indus River Dolphin and the Vaquita dolphin to
test us on, everyone in the room scores zero, and the Randy Risso's
go home empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Once a ship, now toxic waste</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/it-s-no-longer-a-ship/</url><text>
	It’s no longer a ship.  It used to be a car ferry, but then there was a fire.  The fire burned for a week.  Then the ship, the Greek owned Silver Ray, was declared a “construction total loss”.  In other words, now it’s not a ship.  It’s a 200 metre long floating toxic waste site bound for a scrap yard.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/projecting-images-of-poor-cond.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/projecting-images-of-poor-cond.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists use a banner, hung on the Silver Ray (soon to be scraped) and projector to show the poor conditions at shipbreaking yards.   In the foreground is the Argus.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Greenpeace activists who have been on board since last
night, it's also an opportunity to say how shipbreaking is done
wrong, and how it can be done right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They hung a banner from over the ship's side. It wasn't your
regular Greenpeace banner - it had a big blank space in the middle.
Activists projected images in the blank space - showing what will
happen if this ship is sent for scrapping before the toxic
materials are cleaned out. The screen showed people picking up
asbestos with their bare hands, oil in the paint and the
water…business as usual at ship breaking yards in places like
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they activists deployed a new banner, "Toxic waste: Clean
up now", and (after some negotiations with the police) they stayed
on the deck overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning more activists arrived with two independent
experts - one specializing in asbestos, and the other in general
toxic contamination. The specialists took samples from the ship to
begin assessing the toxins on board. The work only continued for an
hour before the police arrived and ordered everyone off the
ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ordered, the specialists left, but an analysis of the samples
they took with them will be ready next week. For now, four
Greenpeace activists remain on board the burned out Silver Ray, and
others are using the Argus (a Greenpeace boat) to visit crews on
other ships in the Antwerp harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ship owners must provide public inventories of hazardous
materials on their ships as a matter of routine and guarantee
dangerous substances are safely removed before vessels are
scrapped. By failing to do this, they're exposing thousands of
workers in Asia directly to poisons and causing catastrophic
environmental problems," said Frank, a Greenpeace campaigner on
board the Argus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sailors, and other people who work around ships, can be a big
help in Greenpeace's work to protect the workers and environment at
ship breaking sites. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/spot-a-ship.asp" target="blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; if you are in a position to aid our

<item><language>en</language><title>Tough questions from one father to another</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bush-how-will-you-explain-war/</url><text>
	As United States policy turns from deterrence to dominance, John Passacantando, director of Greenpeace in the US, is asking George W. Bush some hard questions. But the toughest question for Bush is how will he explain a war on the Iraqi people and a growing world hatred of the US to his own children?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/john-passacantando-executive.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Dear President Bush:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently your administration released a report entitled "The
National Security Strategy of the United States of America," which
proposes shifting the strategic priorities of the United States
from deterrence to dominance. As a result, many of us are
struggling to understand what this strategy might mean for our
country, our soldiers, our jobs and our safety at home and
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trying to understand why you are pushing for a war with
Iraq. We are trying to understand how to raise our families if the
American values of compassion, humility and understanding are to be
displaced by domination, arrogance and stubborn holding forth of
American needs and way of life first and foremost, despite the
consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you, I have two daughters. At some point in our lives you
and I both will be held accountable to them regarding how we have
fulfilled our roles as parents as well as how we have engaged and
changed the world that they will inherit. I am certain that we can
both agree on one thing - if we leave behind a polluted, damaged
world with a legacy of conflict and suffering, we will be deeply
ashamed. So I would like to focus today on the environment and the
prospect of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for Greenpeace, a 30-year old organisation that is
committed to non-violent direct action in order to secure a green
and peaceful world. We oppose the use of violence by all nations
and believe that each and every one must abide by international law
if we are to avoid the massive human carnage seen in the 20th
century. Sadly, both Iraq and the United States have flouted
international law, and it is the infractions by the US that set the
negative example for other nations that we trust and respect. The
result is the undermining of collaborative efforts to isolate
nations like Iraq that have threatened the use of weapons of mass
destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the environment, I am frustrated that your
administration has ignored pleas from across the country to protect
our environment. Yet I am grateful to live in a country where the
president must face the voting public in democratic elections.
Corporate lobbyists may make many walks down the West Wing of the
White House, but we the people still get to walk into that voting
booth every four years to make our voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, there are a number of key questions that must be
asked if we Americans, as activists, parents and engaged citizens,
are to understand our collective role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know why you opposed making our automobile fleet more
energy efficient when doing so would give us far more energy
independence from the Middle East. I want to know about the profits
that Vice President Cheney's former employer, Haliburton, made
during the 1990s providing oil services to Iraq. I want to know
about your campaign contributors like ExxonMobil and exactly how
much business they conducted with Saddam Hussein's regime in the
years since the last Gulf war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know how you plan to divvy up the windfall that you
expect Haliburton and the US oil companies to receive if you are
able to put a friendly regime in Iraq. According to Lawrence
Lindsey, one of your own top economic policy advisors, such a
regime change would double or triple the amount of oil produced
daily in Iraq, adding up to five million barrels a day. With
profits of approximately $5 per barrel, US companies currently
precluded from operating in Iraq could make up to $9 billion per
year. This figure does not include profits to oil services giants
like Haliburton, which would benefit greatly from the rebuilding of
oil wells, pipelines and storage and shipping infrastructure in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this much money at stake, it is hard not to ask some
disturbing questions. Should you decide to declare war, and Iraqi
citizens and American soldiers die in the effort, will these oil
profits be repatriated to the families of the victims? Will the
dollars be used to develop the renewable energy and energy
efficient technologies so that we will never have to fight another
war for oil? If the answers to these questions are negative, then
would we not be sending in troops simply to benefit the oil
industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know if you will be willing to support weapons
inspections, backed by the force of the United Nations, for both
Iraq and the United States. Given our own anthrax attacks at home,
there seem to be worrisome quantities of biological weapons agents,
and even pharmacological weapons, being created in the United
States, far in excess of the quantities agreed to
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most difficult question of all is what to tell our
daughters about Us dependence upon oil and your reluctance to help
us kick this deadly habit. I had a conversation in my kitchen with
my two daughters - Sophie, age 7, and Mollie, age 4 - the day after
the one-year anniversary of the September 11th attacks. They wanted
to know why people would want to kill us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughters were born, I thought the toughest conversation
I would ever have with them would be about boys. Now that
conversation is lower on the list of difficult subjects. This war
on terrorism is a very challenging one. It is about fanaticism and
people so angry and desperate that they resort to suicide attacks.
But even those topics I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don't know how to explain is why the United States is
simultaneously so admired and so hated by people the world
over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a country that prides itself on the ingenuity of its
people, on our ability to create whole new industries overnight
with speed, flexibility and confidence. And yet the Bush
administration chooses to keep our military stationed around the
world to protect oil supply lines back to the United States. We
choose to drive gas guzzling cars and SUVs and to anger much of the
world in the process. We choose to cede the future of super
efficient vehicle manufacturing to competitors around the world. We
choose to live the way we have grown accustomed to living, rather
than to adapt and get smarter. And we choose to indignantly stand
our ground as our 4.6 percent of the world's population emit 25
percent of the global warming pollution. These are not easy facts
to explain to today's younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end it comes down to hope. My daughters still believe
that any situation, no matter how bad or difficult, can be fixed by
an adult. As a result, I keep slogging away, keeping hope alive,
believing that someday we will break through and redirect our world
onto a far more peaceful path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mr. President, the crux of the issue is this.When all the
pollsters, advisors and consultants have gone home, you will have
to speak from your own heart and explain the mistakes of the past.
What, sir, are you going to tell your daughters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;John Passacantando is the executive director of Greenpeace USA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Random House, the biggest general publishing house in the UK, has publicly committed to making its book production "ancient forest friendly". This is a major step in helping to ensure the survival of the world's last ancient forests, and encouraging other publishers to do the same.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been working with Random House as part of the Greenpeace BookCampaign, which encourages publishers to stop sourcing paper fromancient forests and instead commit to ancient forest friendlysolutions. Random House will now be working with its suppliers to movetowards Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®) certified and recycled paperfor its books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Greenpeace UK Book Campaigner, Belinda Fletcher, says that this is a big commitment from Random House.  "This is themost comprehensive commitment developed by a UK publisher to date andsets a good example for other publishing houses to follow," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement is also great news for Random House authors. Some of the big names supporting our campaign include Ben Elton, Stephen Fry, TerryPratchett and Phillip Pullman.  Children's authorsAnne Fine and John O'Farrell, who have also been supporting theGreenpeace campaign, were delighted with the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; =""=""&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne said, "I am really delighted that Random House have made thiscommitment. I very much hope my next book will now be printed onancient forest friendly paper, which will help preserve the world'slast ancient forests for the children of the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John O'Farrell went that one step further, adding, "I will now do my bit for the environment by recycling all my jokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random House UK is following in the footsteps of its Canadiancounterpart, who along with 70 other publishing houses have made formalcommitments to phase out ancient forest fibre from their books. As a result six million Canadian books have been printed on ancientforest friendly paper, including JK Rowling's "Harry Potter and theOrder of the Phoenix". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help us convince more publishers to go forest friendly!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Our cyberactivsts have convinced some publishers to go ancient forest friendly - join up now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	What did we learn from the cold war, the disarmament movement of the last three decades, and the intricate history of arms control?

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/160.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/160.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="hidden"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we should have learned is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development, production and use -- or threatened use -- of
nuclear weapons is a vicious cycle. Weapons of mass destruction
don't buy greater security. They don't bring stability. Mutually
Assured Destruction didn't end the cold war. The escalation of
nuclear arsenals stopped when the perception of hostility and
threat was diminished, buffered by a global perception of the moral
and political limitations of nuclear weapons as tools of
diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's especially important that we remember those lessons now, as
the world community ponders a war which is allegedly against
weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War on Iraq would bring enormous financial benefit to western
oil interests, and we remain convinced that US strategy is not only
about routing terrorism or stopping weapons of mass destruction but
also about dominating fossil fuel supplies.. But let's take, for
the moment, the argument on its own merit, that the US is going
after Iraq out of fear of the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, and particularly nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has opposed the development, production and use of
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction since its
inception more than 30 years ago. The testing and production of
nuclear weapons has already wreaked havoc on ecosystems and human
health; the use of nuclear weapons by accident or through conflict
could spell -- at best -- severely radioactive sacrifice zones with
many thousands of people affected, or at its worst -- the end of
our planet's ability to sustain life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that nuclear disarmament by all nations is a
fundamental prerequisite of a sustainable future for Earth in the
21st century. It is therefore imperative that the international
community - including the Bush Administration -tackle the question
of nuclear proliferation and nuclear disarmament in a coherent
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-scale attack on the nation of Iraq for seeking to acquire
nuclear weapons would be without precedent. The US did not threaten
to attack Israel, India or Pakistan for acquiring nuclear
weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three military strategies available to prevent
proliferation: counter-proliferation strikes, nuclear deterrence,
and military assault to create a "regime change". All are
flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military counter-proliferation -- the Israeli strike on Iraq's
Osirak reactor in 1981 is an example -- may deal temporarily with
the technical manifestations of proliferation,yet it raised the
very tensions which drive weapons programs in the first place.
They're also only as good as the intelligence they're based on. In
the case of Iraq, the IAEA dismantled a clandestine programme to
obtain nuclear weapons. If the US believes that the threat of a
military counter-proliferation response is an effective deterrent,
how can the US claim that Iraq has relaunched that clandestine
programme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nuclear deterrence was a viable strategy, it would be working
now. In Cold War logic, deterrence would dictate that Iraq -- or
any other state -- would be cowed by the overwhelming superiority
of the US nuclear arsenal and military machine. This clearly isn't
the case. For a regime facing destruction whether it uses a nuclear
weapon or not, even a single nuclear strike is easily rationalised
as legitimate self-defence, and an appropriate response against a
nuclear-armed aggressor. Can the US successfully disarm Iraq by
invading the country, taking over its infrastructure, and placing a
puppet regime in power? Possibly. Will a regime change bring peace
to the region and deter other states or agents from pursuing
weapons of mass destruction? Of course not. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Iran. It's a country with a chequered history of relations
with the US. It's politically inconvenient for the US to notice at
the moment that Iran is also moving swiftly toward nuclear
capability, just as it was politically inconvenient for the US to
note Saddam Hussein's use of biological weapons against his own
people in a different time. To Iran, the lesson of an invasion on
Iraq will be to ensure the swift development of its own weapons of
mass destruction, and to develop them while America is focused
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strategies will not succeed. A toolbox of responses is
required, but clearly the first and fundamental question is one of
leadership and political will. President Bush has said that the
real issue in Iraq is not the acceptance of UN weapons inspectors,
but verifiable disarmament. This is true. The problem is the
enormous inconsistency of such a statement coming from the
possessor of more then six thousand nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal non-proliferation regime has been undermined year
after year by the "official" nuclear weapon states, which by their
behaviour clearly show they believe nuclear weapons are necessary
for their security. The nuclear weapons states have effectively
thumbed their noses at the United Nations and international
agreements with an alacrity equal to that of Iraq's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and the other "official" nuclear weapon states have legal
obligations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. They should be
leading by example. Instead, the US Senate has refused to ratify
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Bush administration has
undermined the proposed verification protocol of the Biological
Weapons Convention. And arms control with Russia has devolved into
politically convenient bilateral deal-making rather than
transparent, legally binding and verifiable disarmament agreements
that actually destroy nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush Administration cannot reinforce the non-proliferation
norm by edict. It cannot act with any credible authority to
eliminate the weapons of mass destruction of others without
addressing its own. The case against these weapons must be a moral
one, not a strategically convenient one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, diplomacy. Pressure from other Arab states as well as
western countries is clearly important, particularly as a
contribution to a more effective and positive US Middle East
policy. Solving the Palestinian issue is a necessary prerequisite
for any movement by Israel to join negotiations on weapons of mass
destruction in the region. The US can play a key role in resolving
that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, containment followed by engagement. Continued pressure
on Iraq must include a comprehensive approach to the problem of the
proliferation of nuclear technology and know-how, particularly but
not exclusively from Russia. There must be a containment of the
feasibility of the weapons programme. But there must also be a
containment of the ambition behind it. Furthermore effective
measures need to be taken to stop the spread of weapons usable
material ,and technology, thus further reducing the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what we need is a new theory of deterrence when it
comes to nuclear weapons. At its root, deterrence is and always has
been a matter of perception: the perception of threat, imagined
response, and a close calculation of exactly what either of two
combatants believe they can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morality and what's deemed acceptable behaviour by states and
their leaders is also a perception, and one which changes over
time. As we move toward a globalisation of civil society, we need
to build a world-wide moral deterrence against the possession of
nuclear weapons. The cornerstone of any state's claim to moral
authority, and any leader's, must be based on their accountability
to civil society. They must abide by global agreements for the
global good, they must conform to the most global definitions of
acceptable behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of a state to exert its will upon the world
community should be measured in its demonstrable commitment to the
common benefit of that community. The authority of its leaders, at
home and abroad, must rest in a new, global and inclusive
definition of the public trust. That would mean nuclear weapon
states would commit to, and begin, the process of eliminating their
nuclear weapons in the certain knowledge that such weapons are
incompatible with sane and sustainable security policies from a
global perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any state thinking about acquiring nuclear weapons would have to
be deterred by the strength of global repugnance -- at both the
state and individual levels, to the acquisition of nuclear weapons.
Any leader driving a state in that direction must know that they
will face a credible worldwide outrage,untainted by hypocritical
inconsistencies, and with a moral authority that will be daunting
to their futures as leaders, domestically and abroad. This moral
outrage needs to be effectively backed by agreed obstacles and
sanctions that can be applied in an impartial and objective
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the Bush Administration is unenthusiastic
about the use of multilaterialism in general and the United Nations
in particular as tools for conflict resolution, preferring instead
to use its military power to ensure that its strategic objectives
are met. This is perhaps the biggest challenge for the
international community of the 21st century. We can no longer
afford to continue as a planet made up of self-interested nations
and national leaders. A world in peril needs world leaders,
accountable to the needs and moral imperatives of our common
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every inhabitant of Earth were a voter, what future would
nuclear weapons have in a global plebiscite on their
elimination?&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite underhand tactics, the Japanese government has failed once more in its attempt to pave the way towards commercial whaling. This is fantastic news for whales ... but the battle is not over. Several minke whales have been "accidentally" caught in Korea over the last few days, and we have secured shocking hidden camera footage of how easy it is to buy a harpoon for illegal whaling.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/6/a-ceremony-at-the-ulsan-whale.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A ceremony at the Ulsan Whale Festival, in Ulsan, South Korea, during the IWC meeting.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Ulsan,
SouthKorea, anti-whaling nations won a historic victory. The
commissionfirmly rejecting a Japanese government proposal which
would have paved the way towards a lifting of the ban on
commercialwhaling. It was voted down 29 votes to 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Korea, which traditionally has voted with
thepro-whaling bloc, abstained from the vote.  Our activists here
atthe Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea were delighted at this
news.Through pressure here on the ground and pressure from
cyberactivistsaround the world,  we have made real headway in
convincing theKoreangovernment not to risk their international
reputation by becoming asupporter of commercialwhaling. It is a big
step forward for Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, coinciding with the IWC has been Ulsan's "Whale
Festival" -which celebrates Ulsan's history of whaling.  It is
legal to eat whalemeat in Korea if the whale was caught and killed
accidentally while fishing - knownas "bycatch".  But by some
"amazing coincidence"  several minkewhales have been "accidentally"
caught &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;just in time for the Festival&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. One juvenile minke whale, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/koreawhales/archives/2005/06/another_minke_d.html"&gt;
caught just two days ago&lt;/a&gt;, was sold for about USD$31,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further evidence that some accidents aren't accidental came when
we obtained footage of how easy it is to buy awhaling harpoon  in
South Korea. The footagewas filmed via a hidden camera in an
ordinary fishing tacklestore.  The following dialogue occurs on
camera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Shopkeeper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: Whales sell for a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: I heard there are a lot of harpoon guns on sale at the
moment…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Shopkeeper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: Dolphins used tosell for around 300 000 won (approximately
USD$300), nowadays they canfetch up to (USD$600) 600 000 to 700 000
won (USD $700).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Customer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I tried to find one, but I had no luck, there weren't
any around. The captain asked me to find one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The customer goes on to buy a whale harpoon that can hold a
whale of upto one ton.  We have also obtained the whaling harpoon
itself asproofthat this activity is still happening in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of why, despite today's great victory
atthe IWC, there are still threats to whales and dolphins. 
Thereare loopholes that allow "Scientific whaling" and the
underground tradein "bycatch", which according toRoyal Society
research,  threatens to drive the Korean populationof minke whales
to extinction even if commercial whaling is notresumed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are also several more days where whales issues
willbe hotly debated at the IWC including a proposal by the
Japanesegovernment to abolish the Southern Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now though, we have succeeded in keeping the IWC moratorium
onwhaling firmly in place, convinced Korea not to build a whale
meatfactory, taken 51,000 people to a Virtual March at the IWC, and
continued to pressure Iceland through the &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=959&amp;amp;sk=is&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;Iceland
pledge&lt;/a&gt;.To be a part of our ongoing efforts, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up"&gt;sign
up now to be a Greenpeacecyberactivist&lt;/a&gt;.  The whales are
counting on your continued vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Join the community that has brought pressure from hundreds of thousands of people to bear on Japan, Iceland, Korea, and Norway to keep commercial whaling a thing of the past.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help us win more victories for whales&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=191_181"&gt;Become a Greenpeace supporter and help us win more victories like this.

	Blairo Maggi has won the Golden Chainsaw award for the Brazilian person who most contributed to Amazon destruction. Sadly, rather than accept the award from his celebrity presenters, the 'Soya King' slunk out through the back door of the school he was visiting, to the taunting shouts of hundreds of children.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Comedians from the Brazilian TV show "Panic on TV" attempt to give the governor of Mato Grosso state, Blairo Maggi, the Golden Chainsaw award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our internet-based Golden Chainsaw award, for the Brazilian
mostresponsible for Amazon destruction, ended with 27,849 votes of
whichMaggi, the Governor of Mato Grosso state and the world's
largestindividual soya producer, received 10,348 votes (37
percent). He was followedby Brazilian President Lula da Silva, with
7,314 votes (26 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon Campaigner Paulo Adario assured us that Maggi was
adeserving winner.  "Maggi deserved the award. After two years
asthe State Governor, he has turned Mato Grosso into the State
championof deforestation, responsible for 48 percent of the total
forest loss in theBrazilian Amazon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three comedians from a popular TV show in Brazil, Pânico na TV
(Panicon TV) tried to deliver the Golden Chainsaw statuette to
Blairo Maggion Wednesday at a school in Cuiabá, capital of Mato
Grosso. However the State Governor refused to accept the award and
thepresenters were removed from the school by security.  More
than1,000 people, including hundreds of children, responded to
thiseviction by calling on Maggi to show up and accept the
statuette,shouting: "Maggi, Maggi… Accept it, accept it" and
"Protect nature."But to their disappointment, Maggi had left
through a back door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely happy to have both the artists (from Pânico na
TV) andtheir fans' support for our campaign," said Adario. "This is
yetanother way to take such an important issue as the protection of
theAmazon into people's daily lives." The Awards certainly
capturedpeoples' imaginations - the local newspaper sold a record
number ofcopies on the day of the presentation, and Pânico na TV
has an audienceof about 40 million people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other nominees for the person who most contributed to record
levelsof Amazon destruction were the Federal Ministers José Dirceu
(CivilHouse), Antonio Palocci (Treasury) and Roberto Rodrigues
(Agriculture)and the Governor of the Para State Simão Jatene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the official results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;The official results - who won, who lost, who slipped out through the back door ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now to save the Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_101"&gt;Support our ongoing campaign to halt the record levels of Amazon destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

orange riverboat out of Manaus. The Veloz, strung full of hammocks,
high tech equipment and towing the recently released and renamed
Anaconda (a nine meter inflatable jet boat formerly the Ocean
Raven).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of you know a lot of hard work goes into getting to this
stage as we set off down river and leave the relative security of
Manaus. There is an obvious acceptance by some of the more seasoned
veterans aboard that from here on you have a main objective, but
essentially it's adapt and survive. As far as a legal brief goes -
well what's the point! When the opposition are essentially the law
and blatantly disregarding it. No subtle spin doctors or public
relations work here, just a kick in the teeth and a bullet if you
push it. Sounds a little over dramatic maybe? Exactly what I would
have thought three weeks ago, but hey you live and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way down river there was a little work for the Anaconada,
a sandbank stranding with the Veloz, occasional use as a stern
thruster and regular pickups and deliveries en route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little nine metre boat has been trapped under a mountain of
Brazilian paperwork for the past three years and is now free and as
the only jet boat (to our knowledge) in the Amazon it represents
something special for the campaign. A bit of an edge in our favor
in a place where the words Greenpeace and international press means
nothing. It's an important tool and equally as important as a
little psychological booster. Never to be under estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five days down river we rendezvous with 50 local boats of
varying shapes and sizes, each one packed with local farmers,
fishermen, forest dwellers and their families. We will create a
blockade to stop illegal shipments of timber to the town of Porto
de Moz, which is timberville, the mayor being Mr. Lumber
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main aim of blocking the river will be achieved by a steel
cable with a line of small wooden boats moored along the cable and
an instant community springs to life. There is the school boat, the
party boat, the kitchen boat, you name it - a small community
strung out across the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most Greenpeace expeditions up or down river, medical
assistance is on offer to the locals and our onboard doctor was not
short of work. The first evening saw a 30 mile dash with the
Anaconda to Porto de Moz with a four month pregnant haemorrhaging
patient, first time I've seen a drip administered at 28 knots in
the dark, very impressive, hats off to all those doctors and medics
out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veloz, crewed by the most "up for it group" of locals, soon
became part of the action team, each one a prime candidate for
Greenpeace ships but me thinks they're far too sensible for
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day we restrung the cable, there was much talking
between local organisers and Greenpeace and a log barge stacked to
the rafters full of illegal timber. The barge was coaxed to the
river bank by the local boats and sat there for the best part of
seven hours being visited by local group leaders and
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture this... little river boats only 10 metres long packed
full of family members, kids, parents, grandparents etc. and at
0100 hrs the log barge decides to send it's 4000 tonnes at two to
three knots towards the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anaconda, various loose local boats and the Veloz helped pin
the barge to the shore just metres before the blockade. This whole
situation at night had a very large potential to become very ugly,
frustrated locals took their chance to hit back at the local mafia
and fighting broke out. Some key people, and who knows how much
good luck, stopped people from being killed that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very real situation out here and the word control is one
that you don't use lightly because it is easily taken from you by
the environment itself and by the corrupt system that's trying to
destroy the environment...no other words for it. I was scared,
scared for myself and for the little people at both ends of this
big argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we saw another logging barge and the arrival of the
federal police who are so ridiculously under-funded as to make them
ineffective. The agents were taken out to the barge prior to its
arrival at the blockade, again illegal timber, the confirmed owner
is the local mayor of Porto de Moz. It was stopped and helped
alongside the first log barge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day a planned trip into Port de Moz with the blockade
and two shipments was cancelled after an initial drop off of press
lead to violent assaults by the people of the logging town and one
activists needed to buy himself out of a very bad kicking, if not
worse (sorry he did not get a receipt), and the advice of the local
police, all six of them said people could die if we entered the
town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was good old plan B. Get out with no serious injury or
loss of life, having achieved the objective. This in itself was
another logistical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manaus and Porto de Moz are two different worlds. I think the
folks in the Manaus office have some commitment, but at the
blockade were people who are living in the lion's mouth and
prodding him with a stick because that's all they have. The
consequences? Well, some of them may not see the end of the end.
That's a fact and some high profile organisers will have to leave
the home they are fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing much changes in the fight between the haves and have
nots in this world, but this has been my most real experience of
this age old problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again over dramatic? Not from what I have seen. My most scary
experience, but more for the people we leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big hugs to all from a place where bullet resistant vests are
life jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I still know nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

Anaconda into shape after spending the last year in a customs
wharehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;23 September 2002,Santarem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are back in Santarém, in relative safety. But the last couple
of days have seen our worst-case scenario come true. What
happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the blockade a barge finally came down the
river, fully loaded with huge hardwood logs. So far only a few
houseboats full of workers have had to stop at the blockade, but
this was the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barge pushed on and the captain was warned of the blockade a
long way off, indeed he must have known anyway. But he pushed on
and entered the 500 metre safety zone without stopping the engines.
The threatening steel monster came dangerously close and only at
the very last moment we managed to push it into the river bank to
stop it from running over the houseboats. It turned out that the
captain and owner of the barge was the brother of the Mayor of
Porto de Moz and one of the largest loggers here. After some
negotiating between the leaders of the blockade and the captain, he
agreed to stay here until the end of the blockade. However, as it
turned out, that was not his real intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2 am the engines of the tugboat suddenly roared into
action and the barge started to move towards the chain of small
wooden boats tied onto a steel cable across the river. All alarms
roared and everybody was wide-awake. I had been dozing in my
hammock on the upper deck of the Veloz when things went wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the railing, I could see the barge in the gleaming white
light of the Veloz's spotlight making for the line of little boats.
Dave, our jet-boat driver, was already there pushing the 400 horse
power inflatable Anaconda against the bow of the barge trying to
stop the advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engines roared, shouts and screams cut through the night, lights
jumped through the darkness like lasers, a multitude of smaller
boats headed for the barge or circled around chaotically. Some of
the locals had already climbed on the barge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave managed to slow down the barge but was unable to stop it.
The barge was approaching the houseboats from were we could hear
shouts of panic as men, women and children tried to get their boats
loose from the cable. The Veloz came to Dave's aid and rammed the
barge from the side, pushing her into the bank again gaining some
more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a welcome surprise to us, as the Veloz is a rented ship
and the crew under no obligation to endanger either the ship or
themselves. But they are on the side of the communities and their
struggle and did not hesitate to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this moment to jump down from the deck onto the barge and
from there we hurried to the tugboat. The locals were furious as
they saw the captain heading his 4000 tonne barge right into their
families. They stormed the captain's cabin and fights between the
captain and his crew and the community people broke out in the
bridge. We few Greenpeace activists on board tried in vain to calm
the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the steering wheel of the tugboat was fiercely pulled and
pushed this way and that, the barge finally cut through the cable.
But all the efforts managed to buy enough time for the five small
wooden boats with more than 80 people on board in the path of the
barge to flee to safety. With the tugboat now totally out of
control, but the engine in neutral, Dave managed to stop the
advance and the barge was finally secured on the river bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a second confrontation took place out on the
river. When the cable broke all the small boats broke loose from
their line. The logger's lead boat used the confusion to get
through the blockade. It was followed by some of the larger
community boats and from the bridge of the tugboat I could watch
them trying to outmaneuver each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was spent in tight apprehension until
finally the federal police arrived and secured the barge and the
captain. Soon after, the Mayor of Porto the Moz and brother of the
arrested captain arrived, furious and uncompromising. His family is
one of the major players in local logging owning the two main saw
mills in the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials from IBAMA, the Brazilian Environment Agency, were
flown in with the Greenpeace plane from Santarém and confirmed that
all timber on board the barge was illegal and seized it. Meanwhile
a second barge came down the river, it was stopped by the police
and the timber also seized by IBAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mid-day it looked like the action was a complete success: two
barges full of illegal timber have been apprehended and seized by
the combined efforts of local communities, Greenpeace and the
federal police. And they both belonged to the family of the
Mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the more than 40 boats of the local people were moored
around the barges and the big Veloz overlooked the scene. We
planned to escort the two confiscated barges into Porto de Moz with
the full convoy of boats, once the IBAMA officials had ended their
work of measuring the timber on board. But once again the loggers
played their own unfair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the authorities had given their OK, the two captains
of the barges started their engines again and headed down the
river. The small police crew had to accept the fait-acompli and so
the whole flotilla of boats started too and we all accompanied the
barges towards Porto de Moz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the journalists went ahead in a Greenpeace speedboat to
catch a plane from Porto de Moz back to Belem and Sao Paulo. But
when they got to the town, the mayor had incited people into a mob
and they violently attacked the journalists and Greenpeace
activist. Only with police protection could they all leave the
airport safely, but even the police van was attacked, the doors
forced open, videotapes destroyed. The mayor also took part in the
violence. It was a close call, but eventually the journalists and
activists managed to escape to the river and headed back towards
our convoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They radioed ahead to warn us of the tense situation in town and
it was immediately decided to stop our convoy and not go ahead with
the barges. The barges of course continued, but we all stopped and
discussed our uncomfortable situation. Police arrived from Porto de
Moz shortly after the shaken journalists and activists, and warned
us, that if we continued into town, they could not guarantee our
safety and we could be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the boats from the various communities in the area
sailed home one by one. The journalists and the community leaders,
who feared for their lives, stayed on board the Veloz and we all
left via an alternative route. Later, we heard that one of the
community boats was seized by the mob and burned to ashes, one of
the men heavily beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are in Santarém from where the journalists can take their
flights. The news about the events have gone out to the whole
country, and Greenpeace is currently holding meetings with federal
police and IBAMA to discuss the situation. All of us here on board
have very mixed feelings as we leave the locals behind, some at
their own homes, some in secret places to guarantee their
safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lawless country, it seems, and the authorities are
unable to control the logging mafia. For the time being, we have
all escaped safely and there were "only" three injuries. But it is
clear that this campaign is a different ball game than any of the
other Greenpeace work that I have participated in so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another two days of sailing up the Amazonas back to
Manaus and these should be relaxing days again. But the images of
the violent events of the past days are in all our minds and have
changed the way we look at things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Santarém, 23 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are back in Santarém, in relative safety. But the last couple
of days have seen our worst-case scenario come true. What had
happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the blockade a barge finally came down the
river, fully loaded with huge hardwood trunks. So far only a few
houseboats full of workers have had to stop at the blockade, but
now this was the real thing. The barge was pushed on and the
captain was warned of the blockade a long way off, indeed he must
have known anyway. But he pushed on and had already entered the 500
m safety zone without stopping the engines. The threatening steel
monster came dangerously close and only at the very last moment we
managed to push it into the margin of the river to stop it from
actually running over the houseboats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the captain and owner was the brother of the
Mayor of Porto de Moz and one of the largest loggers here. After
some negotiating between the leaders of the blockade and the
captain, he agreed to stay here until the end of the blockade.
However, it turned out, this was not his real intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2 a.m. the engines of the tugboat suddenly roared into
gear and the barge started to move towards the string of boats tied
onto the steel cable across the river. All alarms roared and
everybody was wide-awake. I had been dozing in my hammock on the
upper deck of the Veloz when things went wild. From the railing, I
could see the barge in the white gleaming light of the Veloz's
spotlight making for the little boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave, our jet-boat driver, was already there pushing the 400 hp
Anaconda against the bow of the barge trying to stop her advance.
Engines roared, shouts and screams cut through the night, lights
jumped through the darkness like laser swords, a multitude of out
boarders and smaller boats headed for the barge or circled
chaotically around. Some of the locals had already climbed on the
barge. David had managed to slow down the barge but was unable to
actually stop her. And she was getting to the houseboats from were
we could hear shouts of panic as men, women and children tried to
get their boats loose from the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veloz came to David's aid and rammed the barge from the
side, pushing her into the margin again, further gaining some time.
This was a welcome surprise to us, as the Veloz is a rented ship
and the crew under no obligation to endanger either the ship or
themselves. But they had all long sided with the communities and
their struggle and did not hesitate to help. I used this moment to
jump down from the deck onto the barge and from there we hurried to
the tugboat. The locals were furious as they saw the captain
heading his 4,000 tons barge right into their families. They
stormed the captain's cabin and fights between the captain and his
crew and the community people broke out in the bridge. We few
Greenpeace activists on board tried in vain to calm the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the steering wheel of the tugboat was fiercely pulled and
pushed this way and that the barge had finally cut through the
cable, but all the efforts had managed to buy enough time for the
five boats in direct line of the barge (with more than 80 people on
board) to flee into safety. With the tugboat now totally out of
control, but the engine in neutral, Dave managed to stop the
descent and the barge was finally secured on the margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime a second "sea battle" took place out on the
river itself. When the cable burst all boats obviously came free
and the logger's head boat used the confusion to get through the
blockade. She was followed by some of the stronger blockader's
boats and from the bridge of the tugboat I could watch them trying
to outmaneuver each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was spent in tight apprehension until
finally the federal police arrived and secured the barge and the
captain. Soon after, the Mayor of Porto the Moz and brother of the
arrested captain came too, furious and uncompromising. His family

discussed our uncomfortable situation. Police arrived from Porto de

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Porto de Moz, 18 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past two days we picked up a number of
community-leaders and people from various little towns and
villages, who will form the essential part of the planned action.
The boat is anchored in the middle of the bright green Rio Jaraucu,
a tributary of the Xingu, and is now really full, with no quiet
corner left. Even the hammocks are so crowded that is seems like
being on a commercial passenger boat, third class. The campaigners
arrived as well, and so did the press team. This means that the
solar-powered office on board is also full, as everybody needs to
use the computers or the communications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Prainha, Pará, Brasilien, 16 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it was rather windy and the boat had to battle against the
waves as we slowly get closer to the sea. We stayed very close to
the southern shore most of the time, in order to avoid the worst.
But eventually we had to cross over to the north side, a crossing
which would take as much as an hour and is potentially dangerous if
we went parallel to the waves… the boat rolled heavily as the waves
hit us from the side. Just before darkness fell - and it is
certainly not advisable for these kind of boats to drive at night
when there are waves - we reached the little port of Prainha, not
much more than a cluster of houses, but some dating from the 18th
century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Santarém, Rio Tapajós, 15 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have reached the town of Santarém, which actually lies on the
Rio Tapajós, just off its confluence with the Amazonas. This river
is very green in color and where it meets the brown Amazonas you
get the same effect as in Manaus with the two rivers running side
by side for a long time before finally mingling into one. These
"meeting of the waters" are common throughout the Amazonas region,
where there are two distinctly different types of river: the "black
rivers" with dark and acidic but clear waters, and the "white
rivers" - muddy but far more noutrios waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dock in front of Santarém, the two churches of colonial
baroque style facing us, waiting to pick up some more people before
continuing our journey downriver. Time to rest, play dominos or
check on the equipment. We have come some 600 kilometers since
Manaus and are about halfway to our destination. Most of us on
board are Brazilians from Manaus or São Paulo, but we also have
activists from Scotland, New Zealand, Canada and Austria. Together
with the boats crew we are currently about 25 people on board and
so far everything is very relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Amazonas River, 13-14 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some hectic days of preparation we finally left the port
of Manaus, the metropolis in the heart of the Amazon, late on
Friday night and set off down the Rio Negro, on the banks of which
Manaus lies. But only around the first bend the Rio Negro meets the
Rio Solimões and together they form the actual Amazonas river. By
day this "meeting of the waters" is one of the major
tourist-attractions here, as the black and still waters of the Rio
Negro flow side by side with the yellowish and turbulent waters of
the Rio Solimões without mixing for many kilometers. Now, at night,
we only got a glimpse of the spectacle in the bright beam-light of
our ship, which the captain switches on now and then to look for
dangerous tree-trunks floating in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace boat for this particular expedition is a typical
regional river-boat, built of wood, with hardly any draft but two
decks. This enables the ship to navigate in even very shallow
water, but the price is the relative instability when it encounters
waves or a storm. This is our home and office and general base for
all activities for the next couple of weeks. She is 23 meters long,
six meters at its widest and we all sleep in hammocks strung on the
open upper deck. It's a lively picture with all the different
hammocks in bright colors. There is a constant breeze which makes
the equatorial heat of the day bearable, but at night it can
actually be a bit too cool. So we all have a light blanket with us
in the hammock, together with a pillow. With these accessories and
the knowledge how to properly lay in a hammock (diagonally!) they
are comfortable at night and inviting for a lazy snooze during the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our first days are indeed peaceful as we sail down the huge
Amazonas. This river is at times up to 20 kilometers wide, and
often it is hard to make out the shores. Countless side-branches
crisscross each other with islands and sand-banks in between,
making navigation a nightmare - unless, of course, you are a local
pilot like our long-time captain Flavio, and know the whole country
by heart. Then you don't need any technical help but just drive the
boat for days without once having to look at a chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second night we also pass by the village of Obidos,
where the Amazonas is at its narrowest: only 1600 meters wide. It
is also at its deepest here, at 100 meters the bottom of the river
is far lower than the Atlantic these waters will eventually reach.
Here we leave the Brasilian state of Amazônas and enter Pará,
timber-country!&lt;/p&gt;

	After 77 days of peaceful protest, our Whale Embassy has moved from the site of a proposed whale meat factory in Ulsan to Seoul. Although our activists are leaving Korea after the international whaling meeting, we will still be keeping an eye on the Ulsan site. We left a huge black whale tail on the site, reading "Korea - country of whale conservation?".

            The Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent reports in the Korean national press claimed that the
SouthKorean Government had scrapped plans to build the whale meat
factory;however Ulsan City Council recently made statements
refuting this,claiming that the factory will be going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the South Korean Government goes ahead with building the
factory, wewill tell this story to the world and will do everything
that we can tostop this internationally condemned plan. The Whale
Embassy will now berun by our partners, the Korean Federation for
Environment Movement(KFEM) in Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Korean Government makes huge claims about wanting to
protecttheir remaining whales, yet do nothing about the trade in
whale meat.KFEM's director Choi Ye-yong said, "How can you reduce
bycatch bybuilding a factory to process the carcasses? It is as
ridiculous asbuilding a factory to process the tusks of
'accidentally' caughtelephants, then paying the people who
'accidentally' caughtthem."  DNA research has recently found that
there aresignificantly more whales being found in the marketplace
than could beaccounted for by the "accidental" bycatch. During the
period from June19 to June 23 alone, five juvenile minke whales
were caught"accidentally" off the coast of Korea - right in time
for Ulsan's whalefestival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 7, the Whale Embassy was built to highlight the threats
facingKorea's few remaining whales. Since then tens of thousands of
peoplehave lent their support to the campaign and the activists
from 20countries that staffed the embassy over the 77 days of
peacefulprotest, highlighted by over 50,000 people participating in
our VirtualMarch held during the &lt;span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'&gt;International Whaling Commission meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Last week Amaltal Fishing Company director Andrew Talley called Greenpeace assertions "unsubstantiated claptrap". But dramatic photos and footage taken by the Rainbow Warrior crew prove him and others supporting bottom trawling wrong.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace crew from the Rainbow Warrior captured images of
endangeredblack and red corals being hauled aboard a New Zealand
bottom trawlerin international waters near Norfolk Island.
(Although the smallercorals looks red, it is the skeleton of the
coral that is black. Thelarge red coral is a centuries-old
gorgonian tree coral.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the action on video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Again and again, we have caught the bottom trawling
industryred-handed with the evidence of deep sea destruction in
their nets. Howmany more pictures of clearfelled coral forests do
governments need tosee before they recognise that a moratorium on
bottom trawling ininternational waters is urgently needed?" said
Carmen Gravatt,Greenpeace oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="154958" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fishing industry leaders scraped the bottom of the barrel last
weekwhen they claimed bottom trawl nets didn't touch the sea floor.
Well,once again we've got the proof," said Gravatt. "We'd like to
see thefishing industry swallow their pride, realise that bottom
trawling isnot sustainable and support our calls for a UN
moratorium on bottomtrawling in international waters".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nets of the Waipori, owned by the Tasman Pacific company,
seemed tohave few fish but many pieces of the corals. Greenpeace
filmed a rangeof bottom dwelling species that were also in the haul
of the NewZealand vessel, including a rare crab.&lt;/p&gt;

described asa marine 'Jurassic Park' - with ancient species that
are the tuatara ofthe sea, as old as dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Government delegation at last week's UN meeting

<item><language>en</language><title>South Korean Government scraps whale meat factory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/south-korea-scraps-whale-factory/</url><text>
	In an amazing turn of events, the city of Ulsan has apparently courageously decided not to build the proposed whalemeat factory – the target of our Whale Embassy occupation.  The news of this decision was reported in a South Korean newspaper on the eve of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A paragliding pilot flies over Greenpeace and KFEM activists protesting against the proposed construction of a whale meat processing factory in Ulsan May 31, 2005. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UlsanCity Council planned to build a whale meat processing plant
inJangsaengpo, Ulsan, intending to start construction late
thisyear.  The &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/" target="_blank"&gt;Korean fisheries ministry insisted&lt;/a&gt; that this
plant was "a check-point for dealing with whale carcasses in an
environment-friendly and sanitary manner".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to newspaper reports in the South Korean
paper TheHankyoreh, the council has decided to scrap the plans
largely because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Greenpeace called the facility a whale meat factory at its website,which caused the international community to view Korea as a pro-whalingnation. The city decided that going ahead with the plan would not be inthe national interest. It also had trouble raising the fund. In theend, it decided to scrap the plan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Council will not commit to us in writing that the
factorywill not be built.  According to the same newspaper report,
a cityofficial said, "It is unprecedented that the city produces an
officialdocument confirming its decision for an NGO
[Non-GovernmentalOrganisation]. People may view such document as a
sign that the cityhas changed its policy in the face of outside
pressure. So putting thedecision in writing is unthinkable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Korean Federation for Environment Movement
issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace and KFEM are greatly encouraged by news released
today inthe South Korean publication, The Hankyoreh, that plans to
build awhalemeat factory in Ulsan, South Korea have been
scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these reports are true, Greenpeace and KFEM welcome the South
KoreanGovernment's courageous move. By scrapping the planned whale
meatfactory, the South Korean Government is showing that it does
notsupport whaling, and it does not wish to follow in the footsteps
of theJapanese Government in their determination to destroy the
world'sdwindling numbers of whales. We hope that this move towards
whaleprotection will be extended to the IWC, and that the South
KoreanGovernment will now vote in favour of whale protection and
vote againsta resumption of commercial whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the whale meat factory victory is great news,  thebattle
to save Korea's whales has not ended - this weekend sees thestart
of the IWC in Ulsan, and anotherchance for the Korean government to
prove that it really is opposed to theresumption of whaling in any
form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the virtual march!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;There's still time to make sure the IWC doesn't jeopardise the ban on commercial whaling - join the Virtual March now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us: help win more victories for whales!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.com/donation/donate.php?theme=whales&amp;amp;appeal_id=191_111"&gt;Help us achieve more victories like this by becoming a Greenpeace supporter today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Activists in New Zealand have taken action against a vessel using the most destructive fishing method in the world, bottom trawling. Dodging whole potatoes fired from compressed air guns, and high pressure fire hoses, the activists prevented the New Zealand vessel Ocean Reward from destroying deep-sea life.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists disrupt the setting of a bottom trawl net by attaching an inflatable liferaft. The bottom trawl vessel is the 'Ocean Reward' owned by New Zealand company Talley's Fisheries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Rainbow Warrior and inflatable boats, Greenpeace
activistsdisrupted the Ocean Reward from destroying deep sea coral
forests that take hundreds of years to grow.  Thevessel was bottom
trawling in international waters of the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists delayed the vessel from deploying its net by
attaching aninflatable life-raft (and dodging potatoes, yes,
potatoes, fired byangry trawlermen.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our oceans campaigner in New Zealand, Carmen Gravatt, said from
onboardthe Rainbow Warrior, "This type of fishing is considered by
scientiststo be the greatest threat to deep sea biodiversity and
every trawl doesincredible damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling nets are dragged along the sea floor. Huge
chains orrollers attached to the front of the nets destroy
everything in theirpath, including coral forests, as well as
sponges, worm tubes, mussels,boulder fields, and rocky reefs. Many
species of non-target fish andother deep sea creatures are
unintentionally caught as well. Then theyare dumped - dead or dying
- over the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we documented bottom trawlers hauling up sea stars,
rocks andeven endangered black coral, despite fishing industry
claims that theirbottom trawling vessels did not touch the
seafloor. (We are pretty surethat those rocks weren't floating,
guys.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the sixth meeting of the impressively-titled United
NationsInformal Consultation on Oceans and the Law of the Sea
(UNICPOLOS) getsunderway at the UN in New York. The focus of the
meeting ison sustainable fisheries and it is expected that the
demand for a UNmoratorium on high seas bottom trawling will again
be on the table fordiscussion - and if not, we intend to put it
there. There is a growingnumber of countries that are moving to
support this as the onlyresponsible action to provide immediate
protection for deep seabiodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

	Faced with a Greek Prime Minister who wasn't taking any action on renewable energy, we announced we would install solar panels on the Prime Minister house. Suddenly the Prime Minister sprung in to action and announced the installation of solar panels on his house, the Presidential residence and the building of the Parliament.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One happy Greek hotel owner with solar panels. Will the Greek government introduce a law to make this a common sight?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We launched an open bid contest, calling private companies to
bid forthe installation of solar panels on the Prime Minister's
residence. Wewould then buy and install the solar systems on the
roof of thebuilding as a protest for the lack of legislation to
promote renewableenergy in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the open bid contest Prime Minister
KonstantinosKaramanlis officially announced that he would install
solar panels, notonly on his residence, but on the Presidential
residence and the GreekParliament building as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Energy campaigner Dimitris Ibrahim said, "We
congratulateMr. Karamanlis for his immediate reaction and welcome
his decision toinstall solar systems on these three buildings.
However, his decisionwill only produce clean energy for one
President, one Prime Ministerand 300 MPs, while the rest of the
eleven million Greek citizens willstill have to depend on fossil
fuels due to the lack of incentives. Weneed a new law that will
provide clean, cheap energy for all".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Greece depends on dirty fossil fuels for 97 percent
ofelectricity production, although there is a commitment of 20.1
percentelectricity production from renewable energy by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is scandal that a country as sunny as Greece lacks of any
properlegislation capable enough to promote solar energy, and other
renewableenergy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation of solar panels on the PM's residence is part
of aseries of events and activities pushing for clean renewable
energyrevolution in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Zero waste victory in Argentina</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ZerowastevictoryArgentina/</url><text>
	After a campaign by Greenpeace in Argentina, the city of Buenos Aires has decided to tackle the thousands of tonnes of rubbish dumped in city landfills everyday. The city council has voted to move towards a policy of zero waste to tackle its wasteful habits.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/action-to-clean-up-a-public-pa.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/action-to-clean-up-a-public-pa.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Action to clean up a public park in Buenos Aries to promote recycling and a city policy of Zero Waste. Later the city council voted to adopt a Zero Waste policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now Buenos Aries has taken a common approach to waste,
repeatedthe world over. Collect it and throw it in a big hole in
the ground.That's 4-5000 tonnes of waste every day. Out of sight
out of mind. Butthis shortsighted approach ignores many looming
problems and sensiblesolutions to the issue of waste. The amounts
of waste are continuallygrowing while the space to dispose of it is
shrinking. A throw awayculture generates more waste every year and
there is no incentive forproducers and consumers to reduce the
amount of waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a drastic approach can tackle the mountains of waste being
generated. &lt;a href="http://www.zerowaste.org/case.htm"&gt;Zero
Waste&lt;/a&gt; is a radical approach to this problem. What might at
first seems impossible is actually already being &lt;a href="http://zwia.org/zwc.html"&gt;successfully implemented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero Waste is a new concept being pioneered by &lt;a href="http://www.ecocycle.org/zero/road.cfm"&gt;leading
corporations&lt;/a&gt;,municipalities, and now provincial and national
governments. It entailsre-designing products and changing the way
waste is handled, soproducts last longer, materials are recycled,
or, in the case oforganics, composted. Waste can be designed out of
the product cycle.Throwing away valuable material that can be
reused is truly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate imperatives behind the drive for Zero Waste
areenvironmental. There is a new awareness of the dangers to human
healthof waste landfills and incinerators. Landfills are major
producers ofgreenhouse gases like methane, and they pollute water
tables.Incinerators produce greenhouse gases, and are a source of
pollutantslike heavy metals. Zero Waste strikes at the cause of
this pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aries joins cities like Canberra and Toronto, states like
California and even countries like &lt;a href="http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;in signing up to
Zero Waste policies. Buenos Aries will start by reducethe use of
landfills, increase recycling, ban incineration and formallyemploy
people currently sorting waste in the street in to
organisedcollection schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aries is the first Latin American city to adopt Zero
Waste andwill hopefully act as a role model for other cities and
countries inthe region facing similar waste problems. We'll be
there to ensure thecity sticks to its commitments in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The world is watching: the Virtual March</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/virtual-march/</url><text>
	Whale song erupted across Lotte Plaza in Ulsan, South Korea, as the World's very first "Virtual March" to save the whales was unveiled this evening, loud enough for any IWC delegates not in attendance to hear.  Thousands of photographs of anti-whaling activists from all around the globe were projected opposite the very hotel where the IWC is being held.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/6/the-virtual-march-logo-is-proj.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/6/the-virtual-march-logo-is-proj.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Virtual March logo is projected right outside the hotel where the IWC is being held, in Ulsan, South Korea
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters, curious passers-by, locals who had been bombarded
withflyers in the last few days, Embassy activists and the world's
mediagathered in Lotte Plaza to witness the spectacle of thousands
of imagesof people protesting the prospect of resumed commercial
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The whale sounds were truly eerie echoing around the
ultra-modern LotteMultiplaza, flanked by a multiplex cinema and
Pizza Hut.  Alongwith the projection it was enough to give you
goosebumps - and therewere certainly tears in some onlookers'
eyes!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 50,000thousand people from 122 countries took part in the
Virtual March bysending photographs of themselves with a banner
expressing theirconcern about the fate of the world's dwindling
populations of whales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our resident whale guru John Frizell summed it up
beautifully. "We have brought the protest from thousands of people
to the decisionmakers; to show them that even though their
decisions may be madebehind closed doors, the whole world is
watching."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TheMinistry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of South Korea has
alreadypublicly declared an interest in resuming whaling under the
guise of'scientific' research.  South Korea is also threatening to
supportthe Japanese Government's attempts to overturn the global
moratorium oncommercial whaling. Just last night, a minke whale was
butcheredoutside Ulsan's whale meat restaurants under dubious
circumstances,with one local declaring that the catch was not
accidental. (SouthKorea permits the sale of meat from &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-activists-threatened/"&gt;
"accidentally killed"&lt;/a&gt; whales.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wehope that tonight's events will help the Korean Government
tounderstand that the international reputation of their country
hangs inthe balance in the decisions they will make in the week
ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our Argentine Ocean Defenders have hit Nissui in their pockets. Nissui own about one third of Kyodo Senpaku -- the people who run the Japanese whaling fleet. Our cyberactivists have convinced a major Nissui client in Argentina not to buy from a corporation involved in the killing of whales.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Despite the continued killing of whales by Japan there was some good news for whales when a Argentine seafood company canceled a contract with Nissui, a Japanese corporation involved in whaling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as directly confronting the whaling fleet in the
Southern Oceanwe have been exposing howmany well-known companies
are linked to corporations involved inwhaling. Internationally we
have been &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/our-oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;focussing
on Gorton's&lt;/a&gt;,but in Argentina the focus is on companies that do
business with one ofthe corporations most closely linked to whaling
in Japan, Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissui has Argentine subsidiaries that operate freezer trawlers,
one ofwhich is a surimi (type of minced fish) processor, which is
sold inArgentina, Uruguay and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="story" item_id="298576"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular seafood company in Argentina, Pesquera Santa Elena was
usingNissui fish in its products. So we targeted Santa Elena to ask
them tostop buying from Nissui and make it clear that whaling is
bad forbusiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just 2 days over 21,000 cyberactivists contacted the company
anddownloaded stickers to place on Santa Elena products in super
markets,to highlight that the company was implicated in the killing
of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably quickly the president of Santa Elena was sitting at
thetable with us to negotiate. Faced with the possible damage to
thecompanies public image from being linked to whaling it was
anapparently easy decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Greenpeace Argentina got a signed commitment from
thepresident of Santa Elena not to buy any more surimi from Nissui.
Thecompany even committed to donate about US$60,000 to an
organisationworking on whale conservation if they ever violate the
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one big client less for Nissui, and we are pressing other
companiesto follow suit. Maybe Gorton's can learn from Santa
Elena's goodexample? In Argentina we are now focussing on other
companies that buyfrom Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=1217756"&gt;Stand up to make a difference for the whales - Tell Gorton's and Nissui that their customers do not support whaling!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=argentinavictory"&gt;We rely on individual donations to fund our work challenging the whalers on the high seas and their corporate backers in the world of commerce. Give today to help save whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Brazilian police bust Amazon logging gang</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/brazilian-federal-police/</url><text>
	The Brazilian Federal Police have dismantled a gang responsible for illegal logging in the State of Mato Grosso for 14 years. 89 arrest warrants were issued - including for corrupt Brazilian Environmental Agency (IBAMA) agents and loggers, who were responsible for the illegal logging of enough timber to fill 76,000 trucks.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/greenpeace-discovers-an-illega.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace uncovers an illegal logging operation in the Amazon. Brazilian Federal Police have launched a crack down on illegal logging operations in one part of the Amazon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the investigations, 283 Forest Management Plans were
suspendedand another 36 were cancelled indefinitely. Also, 431
"ghost loggingcompanies" were exposed all over the Mato Grosso
State. The operationalso exposed false ATPFs (Authorization of
Forest Products Transport),which are a way of "laundering"
authorisations in order to use themagain.  The operation involved
450 Federal Police agents and 31IBAMA agents and is the largest
ever carried out by the Federal Policein the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon Campaign Coordinator, Paulo Adario said, "It is
important to stress thatthe arrests of loggers and IBAMA agents
today in Mato Grosso are notisolated cases. The Federal Police and
IBAMA should extend this kind ofinvestigation to other Amazon
States, such as Para and Rondonia, wheredeforestation and illegal
logging are rampant. Also, the federalagencies such as IBAMA,
Federal Police and INCRA (the NationalInstitute of Colonisation and
Land Reform) need to be strengthened andprepared to fight illegal
logging, land grabbing,deforestation and crimes against human
rights."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;More good news for the Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another positive note, in a major move toward Amazon
forestprotection, the governor and the major of São Paulo have
announcedtheir aim to join Greenpeace's Amazon Friendly City
Campaign. OnWorld Environment Day the State Governor of São Paulo,
Geraldo Alckmin,and the Mayor of São Paulo, José Serra, made an
important contributionto protect the Amazon. Both governments
formally joined our "AmazonFriendly City" campaign - effectively
closing the door to illegaltimber. They also issued a decree
demanding suppliers to presentevidence of the legal origin of the
timber on all public purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebeca Lerer, our Amazon campaigner, said, "After a run of bad
newssuch as the murder of Sister Dorothy Stang and the high levels
ofAmazon deforestation, we finally have something to celebrate. São
Paulois the world's largest consumer of Amazon timber. Today's
decision willclose the door to illegal timber and will oblige
suppliers to complywith the new environmental standards. Those who
work illegally havejust lost a great slice of the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vote now for the Golden Chainsaw award!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;Vote now and nominate the worst destroyer of the Amazon rainforest!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give to save the Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_101"&gt;Support our Amazon campaign and make sure there is more good news for the Amazon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With all the action in the Southern Ocean, it's good to remember that people all over the world -- our ocean defenders -- are working hard to defend our oceans back here on solid ground (and in cyberspace). The 17th of January was a big day with governments, activists, supermarkets and even Mother Nature helping to defend our oceans.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace supporters take symbolic action against Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been joined by 17 governments in a call to the
government ofJapan to "cease its lethal scientific research on
whales and assure thereturn of the vessels" from the Southern Ocean
whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 17 governments comprehensively denounced the so-called
scientifichunt as a sham, noting that "Japan is now killing more
whales in theAntarctic every year than it killed for scientific
research in the 31years prior to the introduction of the moratorium
on commercialwhaling." They further express "grave concerns" that
the hunt "willundermine the long-term viability" of both fin and
humpback whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget that along with pressure from governments,
globalcorporations like Nissui also have a role to play in bringing
an end tothe hunt. Japan'ssecond-largest marine products company,
Nissui owns one third of KyodoSenpaku, which operates the whaling
fleet. We are urging people to &lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2008266"&gt;
tellNissui that "whaling is bad for business"&lt;/a&gt; and use its
influence to stop whaling now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, a 20 ton fin whale found dead in the Baltic Sea was
movedto the Japanese Embassy in Berlin to make the point "you don't
needharpoons to study dead whales". The unfortunate whale appears
to havelost itself in the Baltic Sea and starved to death, but the
realscientists at the it's final destination - the German
OceanographicMuseum - will be able to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/1/asda-poster.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the UK, we had climbers scaling a building at
theheadquarters of ASDA - the supermarket chain owned by Walmart.
Scoring just one point out of 20, ASDA came rock bottom of our
recent &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/supermarkets/recipe_for_disaster.cfm"&gt;
league table&lt;/a&gt; with the least sustainable seafood policy of any
UK supermarket. It was found to be selling at least 13 species on
Greenpeace's 'danger list' including swordfish, marlin and Atlantic
cod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbers hung a massive banner with the ASDA logo and
catchphrase 'That'sASDA Price' against a backdrop of mutilated and
wasted fish caught asbycatch during destructive fishing. At the
same time volunteers dressedas 'fishmongers,' accompanied by a
mobile advertising van displayingthe same billboard poster, toured
the city, visiting one of ASDA'slocal stores to deliver the message
to the supermarket's customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action was a huge success. Within a hour of arriving at ASDA
House,campaigners were invited inside to discuss policy. ASDA 
agreednot only to publish a public policy on sourcing sustainable
seafoodwithin the next six weeks, but also to remove skate, dogfish
(huss),dover sole and ling from its shelves with immediate effect.
They'vealso agreed to look closely at taking similar action on
swordfish andmarlin within the next six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Our Oceans: You can help!&lt;/a&gt; screened in Dam Square,
Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other events around the world starred the whale fluke -- on
thebeach inNew Zealand, outside the White House in Washington DC
and in Toronto, Canada. A giant video-wall was set up in DamSquare,
Amsterdam playing our "Defending Our Oceans: You can help!"footage.

be an OceanDefender&lt;/a&gt; - simply by adding your name to this very

&lt;p&gt;To complete the day, Mother Nature lent a helping hand, with &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/"&gt;atrocious
weather conditions&lt;/a&gt; ensuringthere was no whaling in the Southern
Ocean Whaling Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2008266"&gt;Tell Nissui Europe to use its influence to stop whaling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=whaleofaday"&gt;We rely on individual donations to fund our work challenging the whalers on the high seas and their corporate backers in the world of commerce.

	We've been here before: the Southern Ocean, the Japanese whaling fleet, Greenpeace defending the lives of whales in the face of so called "scientific whaling". And in true de ja vu style, the whalers are once again accusing Greenpeace of recklessness -- after one of their catcher ships, the Kyo-maru, rammed our vessel Esperanza. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japanese whaling fleet catcher ship Kyo Maru No.1 heads towards the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Kamp, the captain of the Esperanza said: "Regarding the
Kyo-maru,the catcher hit the Esperanza. The Esperanza was on the
steady coursebehind the Nisshin Maru. The Kyo Maru approached the
Esperanza from thestern on the port side. The Kyo Maru  was obliged
byInternational Collision legislation to give way to the Esperanza,
asthey came from behind. They came close then moved toward us and
madecontact on our port side. We have kept steady course the whole
time.The Esperanza suffered no damage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar incident in 1999, (oddly on exactly the same day,
December21st) the same tactic was attempted by the whalers.  To
this day,Lloyds List, which is the definitive resource on maritime
incidents,puts the blame squarely on the Japanese whaling
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace puts the utmost emphasis on safety. Our crew are
thoroughlytrained and equipped to ensure the  safe operations
underdangerous conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same whalers who call their whaling programme
"scientificresearch"  (despite the fact that the International
WhalingCommission has termed the programme scientifically useless) 
wantyou to believe that Greenpeace is reckless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's rhetoric, and there's reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our helicopter team in the air capturing the actions
onvideo when the collisions occurred.  You can view the video
here,and judge foryourself (29 meg)&lt;/p&gt;

	France thinks it can get away with dumping a warship containing hundreds of tonnes of toxic materials like asbestos, PCBs, lead and mercury in India. We say that's illegal toxic dumping -- so we have boarded the warship to prevent it getting to India.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists board the Clemenceau for the second time in a month as a millitary helicopter buzzes overhead. The activists are protesting France dumping the toxic ship in India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;French authorities seem determined to see unprotected workers
scrap theaircraft carrier, Clemenceau and allow poor workers to
sortthe toxic waste by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are just as determined to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two activists have boarded the ship during its transit through
theMediterranean towards India. One of them, Sebastian, spent &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ghost-ship-121205/"&gt;
24 hours on the mast of the Clemenceau one month ago&lt;/a&gt;trying to
prevent it leaving France. Last time he had only one apple toeat
and a banner to sleep in but he's back again, prepared to prevent
Francegetting away with dumping the ship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Victory! Update 15 Feb: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;French President Chirac has announced a dramatic recall of theasbestos-laden warship Clemenceau == it will be turning around andgoing back to France. Our actions, emails to Chirac and an embarrassinginternational scandal left France with little choice but to abandon themisguided attempt to dump its own toxic mess on India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hovering above Sebastianis a French military helicopter. Navy
personnel have boarded theship, no doubt to ensure it makes it to
an Indian shipbreakingyard so a poor worker can hand sort France's
deadly asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time France has tried to dump the toxic
asbestoscarrier on someone else, nor the first time its been
boarded to send itback to France. In 2003 France tried to send it
for scrapping inBangladesh, via Greece. But the Greek military
boarded the ship in theMediterranean and forced it to return to
France. &lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/clemenceau.gif"&gt;
View the history of the ship&lt;/a&gt; nobody wants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;France wants to send the ship to be scrapped on the beaches of
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/india.asp"&gt;Alang,
India&lt;/a&gt;. Check out where France thinks its OK to send its toxic
waste:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;India doesn't want it either&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since our action in France last month, the story has been &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/campaigns/toxics-free-future/ship-breaking/deathship"&gt;
making headlines in India&lt;/a&gt;.Our activists at the French embassy
in Delhi were immediatelyarrested in a failed attempt to silence
the growing protests in India.On January 7, the Indian Supreme
Court issued an interim rulingordering the ship to stay out of
Indian waters due to the hundreds oftonnes of asbestos onboard. But
despite this, the Clemenceau is stillheading straight for
India.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under an international law, calledthe Basel convention, France
is not allowed to dump toxic waste in adeveloping country like
India. But France is exploiting a loophole thatallows the ship not
to be called 'waste' until it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take thewaste out of the ship and put it in barrels back on the
ship - that'sillegal hazardous waste transport, leave it in the
structure of theship and you have a excuse to let the ship poison
and kill people indeveloping countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's a garbage argument. It's bad enough that theshipping
industry uses it to justify sending toxic garbage to India,  but
for a country like France to use it isindefensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Clemenceau may be one of the largest ships to be sent for
scrap butevery year a vast decrepit armada bearing a dangerous
cargo of toxicsubstances, asbestos, PCBs and heavy metals, ends up
in ship breakingyards in Bangladesh, India, China and Pakistan,
where they are cut upin the crudest of fashions, taking a huge toll
on human health and thelocal environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asian ship breaking yards are perfect forthe shipping industry.
They can make a quick profit by dumping oldships that are too
expensive to scrap in developed countries due to thehazardous
materials in them. Such problems evaporate when environmentalrule
enforcement is lax and workers rights practically non-existent.
Adream come true for unscrupulous shipping industry but a nightmare
forthe environment and workers safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/"&gt;campaigning to end
this nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/solutions.asp"&gt;solution
is simple&lt;/a&gt;. Developed countries should decontaminate old ships
before they are sent for scrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning our ship the Arctic Sunrise was deliberately rammed and damaged by the Nisshin Maru, the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet. Straight after the ramming, the Nisshin Maru began to steam away from the "scene of the crime". However both the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza are in pursuit with every intention of continuing to peacefully protest the hunt.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/1/damage-to-the-bow-of-the-green-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Damage to the bow of the Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise following a collision with the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet, Nisshin Maru. The Nisshin Maru cut across the bow of the Arctic Sunrise, causing the collision. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking from onboard the Arctic Sunrise, expedition leader
ShaneRattenbury said, "There is no way to describe this as anything
but adeliberate ramming which placed the safety of our ship and the
lives ofour crew in severe danger." The Nisshin Maru is more than
twice as longand six times heavier than the Arctic Sunrise. The
impact has left theSunrise "battered and bruised" but luckily no
crew members were injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight the Nisshin Maru had been offloading accumulated whale
meatontoa supply vessel and early this morning our activists, in
inflatables,began to paint the words "whale meat from sanctuary" on
the side of thesupply ship. This action in no way impeded the
transfer of the meat andthe tiny inflatables did not represent a
threat to either vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the activists completed painting the slogan, the Nisshin
Marusuddenlydisengaged from the supply vessel coming around a full
360 degreesbeforemaking for the Arctic Sunrise, which was about a
kilometre away, andstriking it on the port side. The captain of the
Sunrise tried to pullout of the way of the oncoming whaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on December 21, when the catcher ship the Kyo Maru bumped
theEsperanza, the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR)
said "thesame thing occurred five years ago when in 1999 another
collisionoccurred between Japan's research vessels and a Greenpeace
vessel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was the Nisshin Maru, not the Arctic Sunrise, which
was atfault for the collision in December 1999 also, as officially
recordedin the Lloyd's database (the international record of
maritime movementsand casualties). International maritime law
states that "any vesselovertaking any other shall keep out of the
way of the vessel beingovertaken."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Watch video of the incident:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have repeatedly informed the whaling fleet and its
controllingorganisation in Tokyo, the Institute for Cetacean
Research, of our peacefulintentions and explained the purpose of
the protest against the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the ramming, we are not going to be deterred. "No
amount ofbullying or intimidation will prevent us from defending
the whales, norfrom broadcasting images of the kills to the world,"
said Shane.&lt;/p&gt;

	The crews of the Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise are once again in action in the Southern Ocean after 10 days of no whales being killed. Expedition leader Shane Rattenbury said: "We caught up with the whalers again late last night and saw seven whale carcasses on the deck. Four activists in an inflatable boat are on the water, near the Kyo Maru catcher ship, acting to defend the whales caught in the sights of the harpoons."

        &lt;p&gt;
            Friday 6 January - The action in the Southern Ocean continues as activists follow the trail of blood left by a harpooned minke whale being taken for processing.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Esperanza crew saw at least 4 more dead whales being
transferred from the two catchers today," added Shane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On December 21, the longest day of the year in the Southern
Ocean, after a month at sea &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/the-expedition/news/whalers-found"&gt;
we found&lt;/a&gt;the Japanese whaling fleet. For the first few days it
was all hands ondeck and all inflatables in the water as we blocked
the harpooner'sline of sight and defended whales and as we slowed
the transfer ofwhales from the catchers to the fleets factory ship
the Nisshin Maru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/01/everybody_goes.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25607/slideshow_action050106.jpg" height="39" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mikey, an Australian activist, earned himself the reputation of
"whale rider" as he &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/eye_to_eye_with.html"&gt;
heroically clung to a dead whale&lt;/a&gt;,brandishing a "Stop Whaling"
banner while being blasted with firehoses."I must admit the look of
dismay I had on my face when I looked up atthe whaling crew and
they were looking down with smugness andlaughter," he wrote in our
weblog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/bearing_witness_1.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25607/slideshow_03.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crews sent &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2005/12/bearing_witness_1.html"&gt;
stunning photographs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tvyil.greenpeaceweb.org/default.asp?loadfilm=55&amp;amp;loadcat=10"&gt;
video footage&lt;/a&gt; to the world. Some of that footage was analysed
by the &lt;a href="http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=158254"&gt;International
Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt;(IFAW). IFAW scientist and whale expert
Vassili Papastavrou, whowatched the footage, said: "We were told by
Greenpeace this whale took10 minutes to die. This is how a whale
was killed when the boats werebeing observed, so what happens when
they're not being seen?"&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, in an unprecedented move, the whaling fleet fled. We have
been tothe Southern Ocean seven times to halt whaling in the past,
and thiswas the first time that we kept a fleet on the run for
several days.But this is also the first time that we have had our
fastest ship, theEsperanza, in the Southern Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese ships fledalmost 2,000 nautical miles (3,700km)
over the past 11 days, putting atemporary stop to their whaling
operations. The fleet may now be undereven more pressure to meet
their quota. Shane said, "We lost track ofthe fleet for about 24
hours after they refuelled, but we are back inplace ready to ensure
they don't meet their new whaling quota of 935minke and 10 fin
whales."&lt;/p&gt;

	The boy with the lightening bolt on his forehead is back. And this time, Harry's not only saving Muggles and Hogwarts from the evil powers of Voldemort, he's also working a little magic for the world's ancient and endangered forests.

            Harry Potter: working magic to save ancient forests
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian edition of Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix is printed on Ancient Forest Friendly paper (100% post
consumer recycled, processed chlorine free paper). That's not only
good news for Canada's ancient rainforests and the vast boreal
forests that stretch across the north of Canada, it's also good for
forests around the world and the species that depend on them for
their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By printing Harry Potter on Ancient Forest Friendly paper,
Raincoast Books is turning the page on ancient forest destruction
and working a little magic of their own for the world's ancient and
endangered forests. We look forward to seeing publishers in other
countries follow the lead of their Canadian colleagues." said
Nicole Rycroft, Campaigns Director of Markets Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter is the biggest publishing phenomenon of our time
and is distributed in more than 200 countries around the world. The
Canadian edition, published by Raincoast Books, is the only version
of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be printed on
ancient forest friendly paper internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets Initiative, a Canadian environmental organization, has
worked with Raincoast Books and other Canadian publishers to
eliminate the use of papers derived from ancient and endangered
forests during the past 2.5 years. Similar work is taking place
with book publishers in the US and 5 European countries.
Thirty-five leading Canadian and thirty US publishers have formal
commitments to phase out papers originating from ancient and
endangered forests and millions of ancient forest friendly books
have been printed in Canada during the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;How much forest is Harry saving?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By printing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on ancient
forest friendly paper, Raincoast Books is minimizing its impacts on
the environment and helping safeguard biodiversity and the world's
ancient and endangered forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using 1,121,049 kilograms of 100% post-consumer recycled,
processed chlorine free paper and fibre instead of virgin fibre
means that Raincoast Books is making the following ecological
savings :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29,640 trees (a forest area equivalent to 95 times the size of
a football stadium)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;47,007,044 litres of water (water to fill 31 Olympic sized
swimming pools)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;633,557 kgs of solid waste (equivalent to 155 average female
elephants)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;20,248 BTUs of electricity (195 years of electricity to power
the average North American home)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1,215,443 kilograms of greenhouse gases (3.9 million kilometers
traveled by car with average fuel efficiency)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;8486.4 kgs of air emissions&lt;/li&gt;

	Our two ships, the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise, todayconfronted the Fisheries Agency of Japan whaling fleet and called on it to"Leave the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary immediately." In inflatablescarrying banners which read "defend the whales” and “stop the whaling," crew from the two ships declared their intention to stop the hunt.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace witnesses the killing of whales in the Southern Ocean by ships of the Japanese whaling fleet. Banner on the Nisshun Maru factory ship says "Greenpeace Misleads you".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our ships were relaying their message, two 'catcher
ships'arrived on the scene with dead minke whales hung from their
hulls,ready tobe transferred to the fleet's factory ship, the
Nisshin Maru. However,theEsperanza was blocking access to the
Nisshin Maru's stern ramp and one'catcher' tried to push the
Esperanza out of the way twice. TheEsperanza pulled back for the
crew's safety and no casualties arereported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This whale hunt is unnecessary, unjustified, and unwanted,"
saidExpedition leader Shane Rattenbury. In a radio call to the
whalingvessels, from the bridge of the Arctic Sunrise, Yuko Hirono,
ofGreenpeace Japan called upon the whalers to stop killing whales
"andleave the internationally recognised Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying in the face of international protest and repeated calls
from theInternational Whaling Commission (IWC) to stop its annual
'scientific'whale hunt, this year FAJ has more than double its
planned catch ofminke whales to 935 and added 10 endangered fin
whales. Over the next 2years 40 more fin whales will be added to
the annual kill along with 50humpback whales. Fin whales are the
second largest creatures on earth,after blue whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25610/first-contact-whaling-action.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No one is fooled by the giant new "RESEARCH" sign which has
beenpainted on the side of the fleet's factory ship, the Nisshin
Maru. Oncethe whales are have been measured and weighed by the
'scientists' thebutchers get to work and the whales are cut up and
boxed for market,"said Rattenbury. "This is all about money and not
science."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using every available means consistant with our principle
ofpeaceful protest to bring the hunt to an early endand make it the
last time the Sanctuary is breached by the whalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, the Environmental Investigation Agency and the
HumaneSociety of the US, have been tracking the money behind the
whalingfleets. We are currently focusing attention on the US
seafood giantGorton's, the US frozen-seafood market leader. US
consumers arefamiliar with its 'friendly family business' image,
but they are not sowhale-friendly. Gorton's is owned by Nissui USA,
a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Nissui, Japan's second-largest marine
products firm, andone third of owner of Kyodo Senpaku, the company
that operates thewhaling fleet. Greenpeace is calling on Gorton's
to use its influenceto convince Nissui to bring an end to
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In a world were international public opinion is ignored and
wherehigh-level diplomatic pressure has failed, Greenpeace hopes
thatconsumers can once and for all demonstrate that there is no
profit inwhaling," said Rattenbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statement to Nisshin Maru on first encounter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Shane Rattenbury, expedition leader on behalf of the MY
ArcticSunrise and MY Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our two vessels and the crew aboard are here to protest your
whalingprogram, and request that you return to Japan
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area in which you are hunting has been designated as the
AntarcticWhale Sanctuary, designed to help whale populations
recover after thedevastating commercial whaling of the last
century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whales in this Sanctuary are protected from
commercialwhaling.  Your so-called scientific whaling has
beenrepeatedlycriticized by the International Whaling Commission,
and is nothing morethan commercial whaling in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive increase in quota this season simply underlines that
thisis an attempt to restart commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also plan to hunt the endangered fin whale.  There issimply
no justification for targeting an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We respectfully request that you immediately cease your whaling
andleave this area.  If you do leave now, we will leave withyou. 
If you do not leave, we will have no option but tointerferewith
your whaling program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a non-violent organisation.  We will do
nothingtoharm or endanger your vessels, your equipment or your
crew. Wewill, however, use all peaceful means at our disposal to
prevent youfrom killing whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish you safe sailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace first contact with the whaling fleet was at 66˚ south
and146˚ east. &lt;/p&gt;

	How do you get a shipment of illegal logs out of the Amazon and to market in São Paolo? A team of Greenpeace activists risked their lives to go undercover to show -- for the first time -- exactly how it's done. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/illegaltimberdelivery.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/illegaltimberdelivery.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists deliver  a cargo of Amazon illegal timber to the Federal Police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, completing a 5-month secret operation to expose illegal logging in the Amazon. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of Brazil's own Environmental Agency, IBAMA, estimates thatup to 90 percent of all Amazon timber is illegally produced. Whatnormally makes headlines is deforestation -- the wholesale clearing ofland for agriculture and roads. But less attention has been paid toselective logging, the process by which pirate loggers go into theforest for only specific trees with a high commercial value. Newevidence from satellite imagery shows that extractive logging isdestroying just as much forest -- and perhaps more -- as deforestationoperations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found out how this timber gets to market. And todramatically expose the loopholes and illegalities which allow thiscrime to continue, we went undercover and brought along a televisioncrew to document the precise route by which we were able to buy 40cubic meters (1400 cubic feet) of timber, turn it into 29 cubic metersof squared stock, and transport it halfway across Brazil disguised aslegally cut wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Step one: log it illegally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BetweenJuly and November, a Greenpeace team travelled to the Amazon state ofRondônia posing as timber buyers. They expressed an interest inpurchasing not just timber, but documentation as well. It didn't takelong to find both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man who identified himself as Vandinhooffered the team 40 cubic meters of Angelim (Dinizia excelsa) logs.Angelim is used in finishing work -- door frames, floors, and ceilings.Once cut, the market price for this particular timber would be between15,000 - 38,000 Euros (US$ 18,000-45,000). We paid the equivalent of1,600 Euros -- in cash -- for it at the log yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timber was cut without permits from the Forest Management division of the Federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/brazilian-illegal-logs.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelogs were then transported, without a permit, to the sawmill atSerraria Fotaleza, owned by an individual presenting himself as Elias.Under current Brazilian law, the timber was now in violation on threepoints. It shouldn't have been cut without a permit. It should not havebeen transported to the sawmill without documentation. And the sawmillshouldn't cut it without certificates of origin. We paid the equivalentof 1,000 Euros to have it sawn. Cash only, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Step two: buy or forge documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shippinglogs illegally from forest to sawmill over a few kilometers is onething. Getting those logs to market in São Paolo, over 3,000 kilometresaway, is another matter. While far too few, there are inspection pointson state borders and we needed a way to get past those. The illegallogging scheme depends on an "official documents broker" to getofficial documents to whitewash the illegal timber. Sergio Krammer inArquimes offered his services. Sergio's niche in the illegal economy oftimber trade is to provide a connection between companies that haveofficial permits and tax receipts to sell and the pirate loggers whowant to whitewash their illegal wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents cost morethan the wood itself. We paid the equivalent of around 2,000 Euros eachfor three sets of documents, which rose in price between purchasesbecause "the situation was getting tense" after Federal Police showedup in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent analysis of the documents webought revealed them to be genuine. While forgery is also an option,real documents are not hard to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holes on the timbercontrol system allow logging companies to get an excess ofdocumentation, which generates this parallel trade of officialdocuments to legalize illegal timber. The logging companies listed onthe documents purchased by Greenpeace are registered at IBAMA's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Step three: drive by the inspectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterbeing sawn, the timber was loaded into a shipping company vehicle inCujubim, in Rondônia. The total cost for the shipment was just over2,000 Euros, paid in cash. The shipping company was also actingillegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/map-of-illegal-amazonian-wood.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illegal timber cargo covered more than 3,000 kilometers ofFederal and interstate highways. It crossed three state borders and twoinspection points - one in Vilhena (Rondônia) and another one in Cuiabá(Mato Grosso) before arriving in São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It arrived in São Paulo on 6th December 2005 and sat in a warehouseuntil we picked it up for delivery to the Federal Police in São Pauloas crime evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Step four: appear in front of 40 million Brazilian television viewers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedelivered the wood and a full crime file report to the authorities inSão Paulo. The documentary of our sting operation was broadcast onFantastico, one of Brazil's most popular television programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ouroperation's objective was twofold: to show how Amazon illegal timbercontinues to feed the market and to pressure the Federal Government tocorrect the failures of the current logging control system," said PauloAdario, Greenpeace Amazon campaign co-ordinator. "We recognise theGovernment is trying to fight illegal logging but do not believe thatpolice operations alone will solve the problem. The current loggingcontrol system needs to be radically improved."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What will fix this? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'vepresented a ten point set of demands to the Federal, State, and localauthorities to strengthen laws and enforcement at every stage of theillegal logging process where we saw weaknesses. President Lula wasmeeting with his cabinet the day following the television exposé, andwe expect attention to those demands to form part of the government'splans for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of us can do our part as well. Whilethis particular shipment stopped in Brazil, much of the illegal timbertaken from the Amazon goes out to the international market as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toensure you're not part of this criminal chain, make sure you purchaseonly Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) certified timber products, whichensures legal origin as well as environment-friendly and socially justproduction criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the fate of the illegalwood? We'd like to see it used to build a school or a hospital for thechildren of Brazil. The only beneficiaries of this destruction shouldbe those who are innocent of its cause, and those who will most benefitfrom it coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Brazil%20Story"&gt;Help us continue to expose environmental crimes around the world.  We don't accept donations from governments or corporations: we can name and shame without fear of economic retaliation.  But we can only do that with your help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In China, the world's largest food market, 32 food companies, producing 53 brands have agreed not to sell genetically engineered (GE) food. Although non-GE policy is already standard in many countries worldwide, this is the first time food producers have publicly committed to such a policy in China.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese consumers turn their backs on GE food. Greenpeace Food Safety Roadshow visit to Huaying green community in Guangzhou.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, consumers around the world do not want GE
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food companies in China are joining the ranks of a growing
number of non-GE companies worldwide. This is another blow to the
GE industry, which is already troubled by increasing market
rejection and is desperate to find new markets to dump its unwanted
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some well known brand names appear amongst the 32 food producers
promising not to use GE ingredients in products sold in China
including Lipton, Wrigley, Wyeth and Mead Johnson. These companies
have already been selling non-GE food in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sze Pang-cheung said "Transnational food
companies are learning the lesson. There is a heavy price to pay
for applying double standards to Chinese consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we revealed Nestle´s ruthless overseas practice of selling
GE food, including baby food, in China and other Asian countries,
the Swiss-based company´s "double standards" met with angry
reactions from Chinese consumers who returned products to
Nestle.&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=7624&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;&lt;br&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GE is unmistakably the growing trend in China. The majority
of consumers do not want GE foods, and the Chinese government is
taking consumer's rights to choose seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released China's first comprehensive survey of consumer
attitude to GE food in January this year. The survey showed that a
clear majority would choose GE-free food over GE food and many
would be willing to pay more for it. An overwhelming majority of 87
percent wanted GE food products to be labelled. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=111516&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, the Chinese government introduced compulsory
labelling of GE food. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/news/details?item_id=15856&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has stepped up measures to enforce the labelling
legislation by conducting a nationwide inspection. Agriculture
officials emphasised that producers selling unlabelled GE products
would be penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The choice for food producers is either to label their GE
products and face consumer rejection, or to risk violating the
regulation by covering up the true nature of their products," added
Sze. "Companies simply have to make the right decision for
consumers, the environment and their business interests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge more companies to follow suit to address consumers'
growing concerns about GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	Last year parts of Europe were experiencing the worst flooding for hundreds of years. Now Europe is sweltering in a continent-wide heat wave and fatal forest fires. This extreme weather is set to become more common as climate change gathers pace.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Flames consume huge areas of forest in Montalvao, Portugal. Portugal has declared a  national disaster after the worst forest fires in more than two decades killed nine people, torched thousands of hectares of  forest and destroyed homes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August last year southern parts of Germany were under water
after the worst flooding for centuries. One year later, drought is
devastating this year's harvest. The river Elbe in Dresden was at a
nine meter high in August 2002. One year later, it is a 60cm deep
trickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Counting the cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governments are still making compensation payments for the
floods of 2002, the estimated damages to crops from this year's
drought are already running into billions of Euros. Italy, Germany,
Austria, Spain, France and Portugal have been among the worst hit
by the weeks of low rainfall and scorching sunshine. In Italy
alone, crop damage is estimated at E5 billion and rising. The
drought also means consumers are facing higher prices for produce
in the shops. The heat and fires have resulted in a Europe-wide
death toll that is rising daily. Extreme weather events have also
claimed many lives in Asia and the Americas this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The evidence stacks up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one weather event can be directly linked to climate
change, a warmer climate means more storms, floods and droughts.
The events in recent weeks in Europe were actually foreseen by
scientists a few years ago: "Climate change will bring warm, wet
weather, which will encourage plants to grow, followed by long
periods of drought, during which they will burn," -noted Meinrat
Andreae, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in August 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June the UN's World Meteorological Organisation warned that
extreme weather events would become more frequent due to climate
change. Leading atmospheric scientists from the UK and Germany this
week said that the current hot spell could be a sign of things to
come. The world's climate is sending a clear signal that our
pollution is warming the world and causing more extreme
weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The cost of inaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most people are aware of the problem, these warning signs
have jolted most governments into the first tentative steps to
tackle it. The one country defiantly proceeding with business as
usual is the world's biggest global warming polluter by far: the
US. The state of Texas produces more of the greenhouse gases that
cause climate change than France. If counted as countries, 25 US
states would be in the top 60 polluting nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration has withdrawn from the only measure to
tackle climate change, the Kyoto Protocol. George W. Bush claimed
it would cost the US too much money to solve a 'possible' problem.
In reality the oil industries and big business that bankrolled Bush
into office are getting their rewards. Oil giant Exxonmobil/Esso is
one of the biggest backers of Bush and fiercely against any action
on climate change. Tackling the problem will mean switching from
oil to cleaner, greener forms of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where leadership is needed to confront this global threat, Bush
is pushing voluntary 'action' plans hatched with oil industry and
big business, advocating many years of further research. As the
world warms and the costs stack up in lost lives, crops, businesses
and land this 'do nothing and hope for the best' approach from the
country most at fault will increasing look like the thinking of the
last century. Whether we are around to see in the next century
depends on the decisions being taken now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are 3 things you can do now:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;Join our campaign&lt;/a&gt; to stop ExxonMobil/Esso from frying the planet for profit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A year since its first expedition in defence of deep sea life, the Rainbow Warrior has left Auckland to once again demonstrate the devastation caused by bottom trawling.  Last year we exposed the New Zealand and Belize-flagged bottom trawlers in the Tasman Sea ... will this year bring a repeat performance?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/6/the-rainbow-warrior-sets-out-f.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/6/the-rainbow-warrior-sets-out-f.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior sets out from Auckland to defend deep sea life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Walsh, web editor on board the Rainbow Warrior again this
year,gave the following account of the 2004 expedition that
followed theactivities of seven ships as they trawled seamounts for
target speciesof orange roughy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We watched them raising tonnes of fish, corals - and even rocks
fromthe ocean floor! Dozens of species of 'unwanted' deep sea life,
snappedfrom habitat 1000km below us, were turfed over the side of
the bottomtrawlers, internal organs blown apart from the violent
change inpressure. Hundreds of albatross - a bird usually
considered a loner,drifting at the mercy of the winds - squabbled
over the dead or dyingfish."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the huge amounts of bottom dwelling marine life including
fish,sea stars, squid, sea urchins and ghost sharks that were
hauled up anddiscarded, was a delicate branch of endangered black
coral, a specieslisted on the UN Convention on International Trade
in EndangeredSpecies (CITES) for over 20 years.  Black coral is
also protectedin adjacent New Zealand waters. Corals are the
foundation of uniquedeep-sea communities and their destruction
affects everything elseliving in or near them on the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="61560" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a press conference on board the Rainbow Warrior in
Aucklandharbour to launch the current expedition, Oceans campaigner
CarmenGravatt said "Bottom trawling is the most destructive fishing
practicein the world. The deep sea is the largest pool of
undiscovered life onEarth. Bottom trawling these unknown worlds is
like blowing up Marsbefore we get there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, in collaboration with the Scottish Association for
MarineScience (SAMS), we also concluded the exploration of a
little-knowncoral reef complex off the west of Scotland. Using
remotely operatedvehicles (small, unmanned submarines), scientists
studied anddocumented the reef, its cold water corals (lophelia
pertusa) and thenumerous species it is thought to host. Previous
surveys of the reefconducted by SAMS found that parts of the
lophelia coral formation are3,800 years old and the base may be
over 10,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, our political advisor Karen Sack will speak at a UN
meetingon Oceans.  Will the Rainbow Warrior once again unearth
crucialevidence so the UN can see with their own eyes that a
moratorium isneeded?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Each day bottom trawling continues, more deep sea life gets
wiped outand the situation becomes more critical," said Gravatt. "A
moratoriumon bottom trawling in international waters is urgently
needed toprotect life in the deep sea." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea/"&gt;Keep track of the Rainbow Warrior and find out how you can help by reading the tour weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now to protect deep sea life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_deepsea"&gt;Support us and help our campaign to protect deep sea life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Metsahällitus, the Finnish state-owned forestry enterprise that is logging Finnish old growth forests, has agreed not to log in any of 476 areas of forest currently in dispute until urgent talks take place with environmental groups in Finland on 13 August.  The disputed areas are outlined in detailed maps presented to Metsahällitus by Finnish environmental groups.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;inline_item alt="Finnish forest slated for logging." border="0" align="left" item_id="46657"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, after initial talks, a compromise agreement
was reached for just two of the 476 disputed areas - Malahvia and
Jamasvaara. This agreement came after a Greenpeace cyberaction in
which over 3,000 people sent letters to Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and
M-Real asking them not to buy pulp and timber from this forest
destruction. These companies are the three main customers of old
growth logs from Metsahällitus. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en//news/details?campaign%5fid=3938&amp;amp;item%5fid=114562"&gt;
More&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the talks between Metsahällitus and Finnish
environmental groups went on, the logging continued in other parts
of Finland's old growth forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Greenpeace activists take action against Finn Hawk." border="0" align="left" item_id="49756"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;So
in May, 12 Greenpeace activists from nine countries took to
inflatables in the Baltic Sea, intercepting and boarding the ship,
the Finn Hawk, on its way to the port of Lübeck in Germany. The
freighter was loaded with paper products from Stora Enso and M-Real
and was destined for the German market. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en//news/details?campaign%5fid=3938&amp;amp;item%5fid=233492"&gt;
More&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigners across Europe also decided to contact
many of the companies buying paper from Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and
M-Real to get them to express their concerns about the destruction
of Europe's last ancient forests. It appears that the Finnish
companies and Metsahällitus are starting to listen to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Driving the destruction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Siberian Jay in the last old growth forests of Finland." border="0" align="left" item_id="46618"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
European market's hunger for paper is turning Finland's last
ancient forests into magazines, envelopes, copy paper and packaging
material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper is big business in Finland - Finland is responsible for
one quarter of the world's printing and writing paper exports and
one sixth of its paper board exports. Germany is the largest
importer of Finnish paper products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Long-term moratorium urgently
needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the temporary halt to logging is a significant
development, unfortunately it does not mean that the destruction of
Finland's ancient forests is over. A long-term moratorium is
urgently needed to save Finland's last unprotected old growth
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item alt="Reindeer in one of the last old growth forests in Finland." border="0" align="left" item_id="46624"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;It
is not clear whether the temporary halt to logging operations will
continue after the meeting on 13 August, until a final agreement is
reached about the disputed old-growth areas. These critical areas
are the habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and the
traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami and Finnish people
who herd reindeer in these forests. Only five percent of Finland's
forests are considered old growth forests of which remarkably only
half of this is protected from industrial logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace continues to campaign to save Finland's last
unprotected old growth forests and the rest of the world's last
ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

	As you may not have heard, the folks who signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are meeting this week in Geneva, Switzerland.  They're scratching their heads over why the treaty has utterly failed to stop non-nuclear states from going nuclear (like India and Pakistan and Israel and Korea) as well as failing to force the nuclear-capable states to disarm.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Greenpeace 'Most Wanted' deck of nuclear evil-doers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the NPT was agreed in 1968, there were approximately 38,000
weapons in the world. Today, there are approximately 30,000. What
have these guys been doing for the last 35 years, playing
poker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if so, we figured we had to adopt our communication
methods to the audience. So instead of putting another 30 million
people out on the streets worldwide to shout for peace, we made
them a special deck of playing cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cards are good enough for the US military to use to educate
soldiers in how to spot bad guys, we figured they were good enough
for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our "most wanted" pack includes pictures of some real
deal-welshers -- world leaders who promised to disarm and get rid
of their weapons of mass destruction, but didn't do so. Leaders who
never signed the treaty, and went off to pursue nuclear weapons on
their own. And one leader whose country did sign the treaty, and
then went off and developed nuclear weapons anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these pictures will help the delegates to the NPT spot
the evil doers. If they need help finding the evidence, we also
published a handy &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/wmdmap"&gt;map
with the known locations of plenty of Weapons of Mass
Destruction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remind the delegates of just how big a job they've got to do,
and to help them with their speeches, we've also included a set of
easy-to-understand nuclear factoids, with our deck, one per
card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're just chock full of surprises for anybody who's been
concentrating on cutting the deck instead of cutting back on nukes.
Like this one, from the 5 of diamonds: "The latest US/Russia
nuclear disarmament treaty, signed in 2002, will not involve the
destruction of any nuclear weapons." Huh? What was all that fanfare
about when Putin and Bush were being all buddy buddy? Good heavens,
you don't think it could have been PR spin, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this one, from the 9 of clubs: "The US wants to build a
facility capable of producing 450 nuclear weapons cores annually."
That ought to raise the stakes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One really great thing about our deck of cards is that they were
partially subsidized by the US military. Not knowingly, of course.
We went to the same printers that they used for their "Iraqi
Leadership Most Wanted" deck, and since the printing plates had
already been made up, we got a discount. So in fairness, we ought
to give them a little plug here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All of these facts about how the world is bristling with
nuclear weapons are made possible by the US Government."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Let it not be said we don't give credit where credit is
due.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we only intended to give our cards to delegates and
journalists at the NPT, the story got out into the press, and
suddenly we were being asked how much the cards cost and where
folks can get them. We initially printed 600 of them, and those are
all gone... with the exception of a few our &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=2175679042"&gt;
fund raising department snagged and are auctioning off on Ebay.&lt;/a&gt;
(Don't be fooled by the scammers that are selling PDF files for
US$3.99. The PDF files are available free &lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be doing a reprinting of the cards soon, but in the
meantime, you can amuse yourself and learn just how effectively the
NPT is working by playing our&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt; &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/cards/game.html"&gt; Nuclear Solitaire Game&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It features the same cards we gave out to the delegates,
presented (appropriately enough for a 35-year-old treaty that
hasn't accomplished much) in the perennial time-wasting and
unilateralist format of a game of Solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if after a few hands you find yourself inspired to help do
something about nuclear weapons, why not become a cyberactivist?

<item><language>en</language><title>The scent of GE Papaya</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/the-scent-of-ge-papaya/</url><text>
	Papaya is the latest target of the genetic engineering (GE) industry. The Thai government is seeking to introduce the crop to Thailand despite the fact that GE papaya has already been a failure in Hawaii, the only place in the world where GE papaya is grown commercially. Behind this push are the GE industry's big players, hoping to expand corporate control of the food chain into Asia.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A roadside stall selling papaya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya is a staple food in some parts of South-East Asia. It is
a vital part of the Thai kitchen and features in famous local Thai
dishes such as Som Tam, a spicy papaya salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Why play with nature's green papaya?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papaya grown on monoculture plantations, as is the practice on
the island of Hawaii, the United States' 50th State, suffer from
ringspot virus. Plant diseases and pests flourish in these
unnatural, intensive plantations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Thai farmer in his papaya orchard." border="0" align="left" item_id="51388"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Thai
farmers traditionally combat ringspot by growing papaya with other
crops. The insects that transmit the virus are controlled with
environmentally friendly techniques. GE papaya is, therefore, an
unnecessary solution to a problem that can be controlled
naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than advocating a change in farming practices to deal
with the virus, scientists decided that playing with nature was the
better option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;A science based on luck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decided to make the plant resistant to the virus by adding
a gene from the virus to the papaya cell, along with other virus
and antibiotic resistance genes. In tampering with evolution, you
might expect that at least the scientists know what they are doing.
But apparently they have no idea how the virus gene actual makes
the papaya resistant to the virus. Not only this, but the
scientists have also said that they could not control which type of
papaya to make into GE papaya because it's a random process, based
on luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Lucky for whom?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Abandoned GE papaya plantation." border="0" align="left" item_id="51487"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Five
years after the GE papaya strain 'Sun Up' was approved in Hawaii,
scientists have discovered that it is actually more susceptible to
other plant diseases such as 'blackspot' fungus. Now the blackspot
fungus is spreading among GE papaya in Hawaii. So the scientists'
luck in getting Sun Up to become GE is bad luck for farmers who now
have a new disease problem. Farmers who grow GE papaya must spray
toxic chemical fungicides on their papaya every 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Spreading the seeds of disaster to Thailand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thai authorities, along with those backing GE papaya (like
Monsanto, which holds several GMO papaya patents), are rushing
through the GE papaya's introduction in Thailand without adequate
testing. Are they rushing because GE papaya is so beneficial? Not
according to the farmers who have been growing it in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;No market for GE papaya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Bondera (2nd right) tells Thai farmers about GE papaya." border="0" align="left" item_id="51490"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"When
GMO papaya was introduced 5 years ago they claimed it was a
'solution' to the papaya ringspot virus problem. But instead it has
caused serious environmental and economic problems for farmers,"
said Melanie Bondera, a sustainable agriculture farmer and member
of the Hawaii Genetic Engineering Action Network (HIGEAN) on Big
Island, Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they started growing GE papaya, Hawaiian farmers lost their
biggest export markets, with devastating results. The selling price
of GMO papaya fell to 30-40 percent below production costs, and the
price that farmers now get for their GMO papaya is 600 percent
lower than the price for organic papaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Corporate control of the food chain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent holders "act like God - they have way too much power
over nature", said Mike, a farmer sued for unwittingly growing GE
papaya without an official agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers growing GE papaya must follow the rules of those who
hold the patents to the GE papaya - in Thailand that's
transnational corporations and overseas universities. And there are
up to 20 US and international patents that could be applied to GE
papaya in Thailand, including patents held by the GE giant,
Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in practice is that seeds cannot be saved or
exchanged and farmers can be sued if their crops become
contaminated by GE papaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Hawaiian farmer forced to cut down all his papaya after it become contaminated with GE papaya." border="0" align="left" item_id="51484"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
Hawaii, many organic farmers' papaya trees were contaminated by GE
- by pollen from neighbouring GE papaya trees, or when GE papaya
seeds got mixed in with organic seeds. They were forced to destroy
all their papaya trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These guys own the wind", said one farmer commenting on the
corporate interests behind GE papaya and its contamination of
conventional and organic papaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The 'Papaya Freedom Fighters'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that weren't enough, three years ago an attempt was made
to destroy all non-GE papaya trees in Hawaii. Fortunately the
farmers realised that the real aim behind the plans was to force
them all farmers to grow GE papaya. They formed the 'Papaya Freedom
Fighters' and stopped the destruction of their crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Thailand's favorite dish, somtam or spicy papaya salad being prepared at Jatujak weekend market." border="0" align="left" item_id="51382"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;It's not too late for Thailand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of growing GE papaya in Thailand are feared to
be even more serious than Hawaii. Not only is green papaya eaten as
a daily staple food, it is also grown everywhere - in farmers'
fields, schoolyards and backyard gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The message that the Hawaiian farmers bring to us...is clear:
we must not allow GE papaya to be released into the environment.
It's not too late. We must act now to say no to GE papaya," said
Varoonvarn Svansopakul, GE Campaigner for Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Amazon rainforest is more than ancient trees and endangered species. It is home for millions of people and their way of life is often threatened by forest destruction. This was the case for the Deni Indians whose land was under threat by a foreign logging company. But the Deni fought back, determined to protect the forest they depend on and their unique culture. And now they have won.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/5/after-a-long-struggle-the-deni.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/5/after-a-long-struggle-the-deni.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            After a long struggle the Deni Indians of the Brazilian Amazon will have their land demarcated by the government and protected from logging.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deni Indians live in a remote area of the Amazon rainforest
in Brazil, a community of little more than 600 people. They have
had little contact with the outside world and their way of life -
food, fishing, even religious beliefs - are all intricately linked
to the forest that surrounds them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their community was threatened several years ago when a
Malaysian logging company illegally purchased logging rights that
overlapped with the Deni territory. Greenpeace made contact with
the Deni and explained what was happening. Since then the Deni have
been determined to protect their lands and now the government is
marking the boundaries of their territory, legally recognising
their land to keep out invaders and industrial development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The threat to their lands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, a Greenpeace investigation uncovered that the Deni
Indian land was under imminent threat from destruction by the
Malaysian logging company, WTK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Greenpeace campaigner on a log raft in the Amazon." border="0" align="left" item_id="50188"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;WTK
intended to start logging in the area to produce plywood. We
discovered that a great part of the land purchased by WTK from the
local Amazon patron Mario Moraes overlapped with the Deni
territory. These indigenous lands had been illegally sold. During
successive expeditions to the remote villages on the Cuniuá and
Xeruã rivers in the south western part of the Brazilian Amazon, we
were able to inform the Deni leaders about the invasion of their
land by the Malaysian logging company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deni were shocked. They had been suffering death and disease
due to contacts with the colonisation fronts over the past 60
years, they could not understand how this latest problem could
occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the Deni first started the official demarcation process
back in 1985. Demarcation is the constitutional recognition of
their rights over their territory and the only way to guarantee the
protection of the environment they depend on. But by 1999, official
channels had failed the Deni and they asked us to help them fight
for their demarcation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Taking the process into their own hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Deni leaders learn the tools to demarcate their own lands" border="0" align="left" item_id="50209"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Early
in 2001 Greenpeace returned to the Deni lands with a multi skilled
team of anthropologists, indigenous issues experts, sociologists
and agricultural engineers who worked directly with the Deni
leaders from all eight villages preparing them to take charge of
their demarcation. The Deni learned how to handle surveying
equipment, such as theodolites, compasses and GPS (global satellite
positioning systems), which enabled them to acquire a clear picture
of the borders of their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This so-called "self-demarcation" is not common. Usually the
federal government sends in anthropologists, geographers, and
inspectors who determine the range of an Indian community's lands,
write reports and draw a map, submit their findings to FUNAI (the
federal government agency in charge of indigenous issues in
Brazil), and await the approval of the physical demarcation. Once
approved, FUNAI contracts a company to go to the land and cut a six
metre border through the jungle, marking the outer limits of the
property. The Indians themselves are usually involved only on the
periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By September 2001 the Deni were ready to start the demarcation
of their own lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteers from Greenpeace and Brazilian indigenous
organisations supplied technical and logistical support to the Deni
as they marked their most vulnerable borders, cutting 53 km of
trails through thick jungle, and 218 km along the banks of rivers
and creeks. Along the routes, the Deni posted signs reading "Entry
Prohibited. Deni Land."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month after the beginning of the self-demarcation project, the
Brazilian Minister of Justice published the Demarcation Decree,
granting constitutional recognition of the Deni rights over their
traditional territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Victory for the Deni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="The Deni and volunteers for their self-demarcation" border="0" align="left" item_id="50284"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;After
a long struggle supported by Brazilian organisations including
Greenpeace, the Deni Indians won the right to legally protect their
lands from illegal logging and industrial practices. And now the
Brazilian government is about to finish the demarcation project the
Deni began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demarcation of the land will be identified by signs and stones
declaring the area Deni land and by a visible border that will
encompass over 1500 square kilometres of the Amazon. This marks the
area legally as Deni thus protecting it from invaders including
loggers and other industrial development. The process, which has
just begun, is expected to take 80 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have been working in partnership with the Deni for four
years to protect their land and their traditional lifestyle," said
Nilo D'Avila, Greenpeace Amazon campaigner, who was in the Deni
area following the beginning of the official demarcation process.
"We are convinced that the preservation of the Amazon biodiversity,
which is threatened by economic interests and by an unsustainable
pattern of consumption, will only be guaranteed if it is done in
partnership with the people who take care of the Amazon forest as
their homeland".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the indigenous lands in the Brazilian Amazon were
demarcated, almost 20 percent of the forest area would be under
legal protection. "The Deni demarcation is an historical step for
all those who fight to reverse the trend of destruction of the
natural heritage through working with traditional communities and
the enforcement of law," said Nilo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;More to come&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Deni boy with turtle." border="0" align="left" item_id="50263"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
July we will travel back to the Deni territory to witness the
completion of the Deni demarcation and celebrate this incredible
victory with them. Join us then for updates, images and stories
from the Deni land to celebrate their achievement and take action
for the protection of the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

	During June four representatives from ship breaking yards in India and Bangladesh are touring through Europe. They aim to present the impact of the current polluting practices at the breaking yards to ship owners and discuss working towards a real solution to these problems. Bells from the shipbreaking yards in Alang, India, accompany them to remind ship owners of the dramatic effects of breaking ships on Asian beaches. The sound of each bell echoes the calls of the people in Asia for a cleaner environment and safer work. Here are personal stories from the trip in Europe:

            Ship being scrapped at Alang shipbreaking yard.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;2 June 2003&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Asian representatives arrive in the Netherlands to
participate in a seminar on ship breaking. Mr Salim works at a
Bangladeshi breaking yard. Mr Shakir is a lawyer at the Supreme
Court in Bangladesh. The seminar 'Scrapping ships in Asia and
liability' is organised by Greenpeace and the International
Institute for Asia Studies in the Amsterdam Maritime Museum. It
attracts a mixed group of lawyers, shipbreakers, ship owners and
trade unions. But also Greenpeace campaigners, academics, students
and asbestos firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants express the hope that the current pollution and
high rate of accidents will end soon. As a first step mandatory
rules for all stakeholders involved should be set up. Mr Shakir
agrees as no country can solve the problem in splendid isolation.
Certainly not a developing country like Bangladesh. Mr Salim agrees
as he has experienced the dramatic consequences of the current
inaction when 'solutions' depend on the voluntary initiatives of
individual ship breakers and ship owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;3 June 2003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt=" Workers at Alang shipbreaking yard without protective clothing" border="0" align="left" item_id="43024"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Ramapati
Kumar, our Indian campaigner visits the Dutch Minister of
Environment. He frequently visits the shipbreaking yards in India.
Despite many promises and beautiful words by ship owners or their
organisations, he has not seen much improvement during the last
year. He has witnessed men in suits preparing documents and
voluntary guidelines. Meanwhile men on bare feet with cutting
torches go into ships that have explosive gases inside. The men in
suits talk diplomatic language but Ramapati has seen first hand the
remains of the people who die in explosions at the shipbreaking
yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch minister listens carefully. He wants an end to the
current status quo. However, most Dutch ship owners continue to
send ships to the breaking yards. They pay no attention to the
hazardous substances on board of their vessels, with the notable
exception of one company. Ramapati tells the minister there is only
one way to guarantee a better and cleaner future. All ship owners
should follow the same mandatory rules. The minister seems willing
to call on the Dutch Association of Ship Owners to co-operate.
After all he is responsible for the implementation of the Basel
Convention, which controls hazardous waste export from developed
countries, like the Netherlands, to developing countries such as
India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;4 - 6 June 2003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop is Greece. This country has a large commercial fleet.
Part of that fleet is in the hands of ship owners who fly their
national flag proudly. The rest choose a different flag for the
convenience of lax tax, safety and environmental controls. The
participants in the shipbreaking tour have mixed feelings about
visiting Greece. Only recently the 'Amina' - owned by the Greek
company Chandris - exploded in Alang. Ten people died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greece Mr Ganguly plays an important role. He represents one
of the largest trade unions in India. In the 40 years of his work
he has met many industry leaders. But in Piraeus he is surprised:
all four ship owners he meets react in a different way. After the
meetings he compares the companies to the brothers of one family.
One brother is very defensive and will only follow the rules. If
there are no rules he will not take a single extra step, despite
the good and green reputation he is said to have. The other brother
might not have such a good reputation, but he clearly sees the need
for change. He is even willing to play a part in this change. A
third brother is outspoken in the need for change and is willing to
tell this to people outside the family as well. Another brother has
done good things in the past. Yet he is by nature inclined to wait
for further steps to be taken by the government and the IMO. 'The
family has not made up its mind yet', Mr Ganguly says. 'It takes a
good and wise father to keep the family intact and to move the
family forward. Maybe the Greek Minister of Mercantile Marine is a
wise man in this respect. Maybe he has the wisdom and authority to
move the family in the right direction.' During the meeting with
the Minister it seems there is a chance he will use his wisdom
wisely. Perhaps it is at the short-term detriment of one brother.
But it certainly is in the interest of the world outside this
family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item alt=" Activists visit ships soon destined to be scrapped in Asia." border="0" align="left" item_id="51046"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;After
visiting Greece the representatives board a small Greenpeace vessel
for a couple of days. In the port of Antwerp, Belgium, they visit
several ships from a large variety of ship owners. Captains and
crew on board are informed about the current situation in India and
Bangladesh. They are asked to bring this to the attention of the
vessel's owner. After all, he needs to take appropriate action. One
of the ship owners is Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). The
safety and environment manager of MSC seems quite willing to listen
to the demands. Next week there will be a meeting with the
company's top managers in Switzerland. What will their decisions
mean for the people and environment in India and Bangladesh?&lt;/p&gt;

	In March 2004, photographer Tim Georgeson overcame his fear of heights and returned to his native country, travelling to the Styx Valley Global Rescue Station in Tasmania, Australia. His photo's and audio interview document the destruction of this unique forest and the determined efforts to save it.

            The Global Rescue Station, Styx Valley, Tasmania
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a little background on the tree-sit know as the
Rescue Station .... on April 7, 2004 the Global Rescue Station in
Tasmania's threatened Styx Valley finally came down from its 65m
high perch in one of the world's tallest hardwood trees,
affectionately known as "Gandalf's staff". The project was a joint
effort between The Wilderness Society (Australia) and Greenpeace to
protect the area from logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists from around the world inhabited the tree from anywhere
between a couple of days to five months to raise public awareness
of the forest's plight. They must have done something right because
the Rescue Station residents had thousands of visitors including
singers, politicians and international media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a diverse and colourful protest held on March
13th with close to 15,000 enthusiastic participants marching
through Hobart, Tasmania. Now that the Rescue Station has come down
it is hoped that a clear message has been sent to parliament and
that the same fervent feeling will show up in the ballot boxes
during Australia's elections later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Georgeson's aim was to document both the defiance and spirit
of protestors and campaigners as well as the devastation of
old-growth forest that is already being logged, not to mention
woodchipped, poisoned and firebombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can hear Tim talk about his experiences, from eating
scrambled eggs 65 metres above the ground to being chased by a
"metal spider", as well as see some of his powerful photos.&lt;/p&gt;

            February, 2003: Greenpeace 'weapons inspector' outside the U.S. embassy in Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN Weapons Inspectors and citizen weapons inspectors are welcome
to use our map to check up on just where those elusive Weapons of
Mass Destruction have been hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information about these locations has been drawn from public
sources, so we didn't have to worry about invading any countries,
incurring civilian casualties, paying costly bounties for inside
information or mess around with torture or illegal detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the best part: if the US and the UK want to dismantle
some WMDs, they don't need to go on costly excursions to foreign
countries. We found plenty in their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://dynamic.greenpeace.org/wmdmap/map-image.jpg" alt="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" title="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can view the map by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="breadcrumbs"&gt;Requires Macromedia Flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next two weeks, the parties to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) will be meeting in Geneva. Under the
terms of that 1970 accord, the world's non-nuclear weapons states
agreed to stay that way. In exchange, the countries that fessed up
to owning nuclear weapons at the time agreed to get rid of
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope the delegates to the NPT will have a quick look at the
map to easily identify the "bad guys" who haven't been disarming as
they promised. (Clue: &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;there are a lot of little
radiation symbols&lt;/a&gt; in France, the US, China, Russia, and the
UK.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a careful review of available data, you too can confirm
the blindingly obvious: none of the NPT's Nuclear Five have done
very well in scaling back their nuclear arsenals. They've failed
utterly to eliminate them. If the nuclear powers are seriously
concerned about the WMDs of India, Pakistan, Israel, and Korea,
they ought to look to the example they set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now call us old fashioned, but we believe that a key lesson of
the Iraq crisis is that international laws and treaties to prevent
proliferation must be strengthened, not weakened. All of us who
marched against the Iraq war want to see the North Korean crisis
and future proliferation problems solved by negotiation, not
pre-emptive military strikes. "In the long run, the most effective
means to halt proliferation is the rule of law applied universally
and even-handedly to all states, not unilateral gunboat diplomacy,"
says William Peden, of Greenpeace International's disarmament
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NPT declares disarmament the international norm - 182 of its
187 members have pledged never to acquire nuclear weapons. But some
of those states, such as Brazil, are becoming increasingly
aggravated with the failure of the Nuclear Five to live up to their
part of the bargain. North Korea recently left the treaty regime
and has declared itself to be a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25814/ace.gif" border="0" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/press/release?item_id=227966&amp;amp;campaign_id="&gt;
activists dressed as missiles&lt;/a&gt; appeared at the missions of the
nuclear weapons states in Geneva as the meeting began to demand
"inspectors" symbolically dismantle the cardboard arsenals.
Greenpeace also issued a &lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
deck of cards&lt;/a&gt; with the pictures of the known nuclear "bad guys"
to provide guidance to the NPT delegates about who needed to
disarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what we want to see out of this round of the NPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Korea should abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons and
rejoin the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the use of military force to resolve
proliferation concerns, and uphold the value of multilateral legal
mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the "first strike" use of nuclear weapons,
and agree legally binding security assurances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All nuclear weapon states should commit to the goal of
eliminating their illegal nuclear arsenals and halting the
development of new nuclear weapons or the "refurbishment" of
existing ones.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should agree an emergency mechanism to deal more swiftly
and effectively with future crises such as North Korea's withdrawal
from the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The promotion of "dual use" nuclear technology, particularly
reprocessing and enrichment technologies, which is permitted under
the NPT, should be stopped and a comprehensive ban on the
production and use of all fissile material agreed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If there are nuclear weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we hope
the right people find them. But we're not exactly sure who the
right people would be, given their mission ought to be something
the US and UK are not very good at: dismantling them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

	Take a minute to consider the following. What if the world's most populous nation had the necessity-driven willpower to develop the massive uptake of renewable energy like wind and solar power to offset the catastrophic effects of climate change and to secure clean, safe, abundant energy for 1.3 billion people?

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a 'what if', this is the new reality in this huge
rapidlydeveloping country. China is uniquely positioned, with its
size,population and leadership of the developing world, to forge
the way forthe massive development of its abundant renewable energy
resources inprovinces such as Guangdong for wind and Xinjiang for
solar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of last month's National People's Congress (NPC) the talk
wasof ending the 'cult of GDP' and of a 'Green GDP' which factors
in theenvironmental costs of economic development. The energy
sector is keyto this. China is seeking more aggressively to curb
pollution andaddress rapidly growing energy demands. The 2003 NPC
ordered thedrafting of a Renewable Energy Promotion Law by the end
of 2004. All ofwhich signals the intent of the Chinese government
to draw in themassive amounts of clean energy investments and
financing waiting to betapped from strong advocates of renewable
energy like the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week saw two further examples of China's intent. Earlier
thisweek a high level EU-China Conference on Renewable Energy
Policy andFinancing took place in Beijing. This was followed by
Renewable EnergyAsia 2004, running from 7th-9th April. This was
both a landmarkindustry event and a great indicator of political
intent as it wassupported and endorsed by many central government
and internationalagencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was invited to erect a booth and to deliver
apresentation at the exhibition and had an international team of
energyexperts from China, UK, Philippines and the Netherlands at
the event.The fact that we were invited shows the seriousness and
deepeningengagement of the Chinese government with elements of the
environmentalsector of civil society and that Greenpeace's
relevance in China hasbeen recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception Greenpeace received at and around the event
wasoverwhelming. In the words of Red, one of the breathless
Greenpeacerswho has just returned from the exhibition, "it was
inspiring and a veryclear indication of the support that Renewable
Energy has as thesolution to climate change, and of the role that
Greenpeace can play".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's climate campaign efforts were warmly received and
ourexhibition booth was inundated with visitors from
officialdom,industry, academia and the media. Several officials
working on BeijingOlympics 2008 projects demanded that we call them
back, and the Dean ofBeijing's University of Technology told us
that it was time forGreenpeace and China's academia to work
together on renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" align="right" src="/international/PageFiles/25777/robin_cctv.jpg"&gt;Ourteam
in Beijing are all back in the office now taking a well earnedrest,
especially Robin and Donna from the UK and Yu Jie from China.Robin
is recovering from the experience of being interviewed by
China'sstate broadcaster, CCTV, as he's just had his mind blown
away onhearing the viewership figures. He's also recuperating after
sloppinghot tea over an official at a dinner the previous night,
although theonly burning was on Robin's blushing red cheeks. Donna
can now put herlaptop away after &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/showMessages?i=1349&amp;amp;sk=blog"&gt;
'blogcasting'&lt;/a&gt;from the exhibition. Yu Jie, who only started
working with Greenpeaceone week ago, was both amazed at the
experience, and amazing in thework she carried out in a short
timeframe to prepare for the event. Toclose her presentation at the
exhibition, Yu Jie showed two Chinesecharacters - one meaning
danger (equalling climate change) and theother, opportunity
(equalling renewable energy). She followed this withthe statement
"the government of China has clearly recognised theproblem of
climate change and is taking steps to push for solutions, sois
Greenpeace - we should work together".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="58303" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" alt="Wind farm viewed from Nan'ao, Guangdong Province" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
support from the top for renewable energy development in China
isdriven by the need to secure indigenous energy resources for
thenation's huge population and growing economy. China is committed
toavoiding the environmental costs of a burgeoning economy that
someother nations have failed to. Contrast this with the current
USAdministration's view of the Kyoto Protocol. The US continues
topromote its bogus 'alternative', and Russia's dithering threatens
theprotocol's future, while disappearing sea ice, melting
glaciers,floods, famine and drought lend new urgency to the need
for action onclimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technologies are ready, the industry is growing, but
cleargovernment commitments in the form of targets to generate
financialconfidence and investment, from the EU and US in
particular, arecritical. Conventional energy sources worldwide
benefit from subsidiesworth around US$350 billion annually. That's
US$350 billion a year todestroy the planet and that doesn't include
the human, environmental orfinancial costs of the damage done. Just
imagine if those subsidies fordirty, dangerous energy were switched
to developing clean, safe,secure, renewable energy resources in
China, India, Brazil and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China's energy consumption is huge and the challenges the
centralgovernment face in providing energy to its people and
industry aremind-blowing. But, if China follows the same
development pattern as thewest the problem will become much worse.
China could lead the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China does adopt large scale renewable energy production,
thiswill boost worldwide markets, speed up technological advances
and allowChina to not only tip the balance of the global market,
but of ourplanet's ecological equilibrium as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The first casualty of war: truth</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/year-one-of-war/</url><text>
	Last February, 30 million people took to the streets to oppose the invasion of Iraq. "Let the Inspections Work!" and "No War for Oil!" the banners read. Twelve months ago, the bombing started, the troops landed and the tragic story of the Iraqi people's suffering continues to this day.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/3/25-activists-climbed-onto-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/3/25-activists-climbed-onto-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            25 activists climbed onto the famous Brandenburg Gate with banners saying 'no war' and 'old Europe says no war' .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, it seems there were no weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) in Iraq, and that the US, UK and coalition forces
misrepresented what they knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace opposed the war, in part because it was illegal. US
unilateralism was (and is) threatening to unravel 60 years of
building the multilateral system and the rule of law
internationally, and sets a dangerous precedent for future
relations between states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war waged by the richest countries of the world, which hold
massive arsenals of WMD, on a third world country was an
ineffective, counterproductive and hypocritical means of dealing
with international security and the proliferation of WMD. The war
was more about settling old scores and securing Iraqi oil for the
West than it was about making the Middle East a safer place, and
the cost has been massive human suffering and environmental
degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war started, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/unitingforpeace"&gt;we appealed to
governments&lt;/a&gt; who were members of the coalition to renounce the
Bush doctrine of preventive war and consider their own legal
position in a larger context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we sent &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tuwaitha"&gt;a
team to Iraq&lt;/a&gt; to assess what coalition forces were actually
doing about the nuclear materials that had been secured by UN
officials, and the results were shocking indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, and with the latest evidence at hand, we &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coalition-renounce"&gt;again appeal to
the coalition&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to renounce the doctrine of
preventive war and unilateralism, and reinforce the rule of
international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Weapons of mass destruction: found!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://dynamic.greenpeace.org/wmdmap/map-image.jpg" alt="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" title="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can view the map by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="breadcrumbs"&gt;Requires Macromedia Flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, it is clear that the real threat to global
security arises from the massive WMD arsenals and weapons
industries of the US, UK, France, Russia, China, Israel, India and
Pakistan, and the failure of the permanent members of the security
council to live up to their existing international disarmament
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the Bush administration is threatening to start a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?campaign_id=135724&amp;amp;item_id=254489%20"&gt;
new nuclear arms race&lt;/a&gt; by developing new, 'usable', nuclear
weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, we watch in horror the tragic events in
Madrid, as well the continued violence in Baghdad and Basra, Gaza
&amp;amp; the West Bank, Bali and Jakarta, Kabul and Kandahar and ask
ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Has George Bush's 'war on terrorism' made the world a safer place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25779/worldthreat2.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2076"&gt;majority
of people polled around the world believe the war has made the
world more dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. It set a terrifying precedent. It
continues to carry a terrible cost. The fact that it was based on a
lie is what we, as global citizens, need to remember and hold our
governments responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, we asked the government to show us the truth.
Fourteen Greenpeace activists requested that the UK Attorney
General's original advice on the legality of the war be submitted
as evidence. The request was denied, and the advice remains secret.
Why? There's speculation that Tony Blair was advised that in fact a
pre-emptive war could not be justified under international law, and
the government therefore lied when it said the war was legal. If
that's not the case, why not produce the briefing? What is the
Attorney General afraid of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Spain, the government lied about responsibility for the
tragic attacks on its people, hiding evidence that the bombing was
in retaliation for Spain's military contribution to the US-led
coalition. The government had made the decision to go to war
against the will of its people. A government desperate to defend
the falsehood of a world made safer by war piled lies upon lies
over the truth. But in the first victory for the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item%5fid=426491"&gt;
second superpower&lt;/a&gt;," the people spoke. The government fell.
Truth won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Saturday, &lt;a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/calendar.php?caltype=17"&gt;people
will be marching again in protest of the war&lt;/a&gt;. As they did last
year, people from all walks of life, from myriad nations, of many
religions, with wide ranging demands and differing political
agendas will be united by one wish: Peace. If you share that wish,
please say it to the world this Saturday. All it takes is one step
out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/calendar.php?caltype=17"&gt;complete
worldwide schedule of March 20th events&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ecs/s2?i=1303&amp;amp;sk=fxd&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;
send this e-card to invite&lt;/a&gt; your friends, family, and colleagues
to join you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Join Greenpeace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions. In order to ensure
that we remain an independent voice for the planet, we don't accept
corporate or government funds: we rely on the small donations of
millions of supporters. Greenpeace exists because this fragile
earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It
needs action. Please &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/join"&gt;help by becoming a
supporter today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Dodgy deals and irresponsible care</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/dodgy-deals-and-irresponsible/</url><text>
	A recently leaked document has revealed the secret plans of the American Chemistry Council to trash anti-pollution laws in California. The internal memo, a proposal from PR firm Nichols-Dezenhall, outlines tactics such as the creation of phoney front groups and spying on activists to undermine pioneering laws that protect the environment. Unfortunately the Chemistry Council is just one of many industry front groups dedicated to making sure nothing interferes with corporate profits.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/monica-gibbs-lives-next-to-a-c.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/monica-gibbs-lives-next-to-a-c.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monica Gibbs grew up next to a chemical plant in an area known as Cancer Alley in southern Louisiana.  She has suffered from respiratory problems since birth. Toothless voluntary codes and anti-regulatory lobbying by front groups leave the vulnerable, like Monica, to suffer the effects of corporate pollution.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the American Chemistry Council (ACC) taking proposals for spying and hiding behind front groups to covertly campaign against more chemical safety testing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a little background. On its website, the Council proclaims itself to be "committed to improved environmental, health and safety performance through Responsible Care, common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues, and health and environmental research and product testing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds all fine and dandy doesn't it? But as the document helps evidence, the Council is really a lobbying body funded by the chemistry industry. Their unwritten mission is to ensure industry profits are not hindered by government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;To be avoided at all costs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept the chemical industry really doesn't like is called the precautionary principle. This means that new chemicals must be proved safe before they can be produced on environmental and health grounds. This principle is becoming established in laws in Europe but has yet to gain a foothold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the US chemicals industry really fears is that new laws on chemicals being debated in the EU will inspire new laws in the US. The proposed EU laws place more emphasis on protection the environment and health. So the industry is fighting tooth and nail against the new laws in Europe with, of course, help from the corporate-friendly US administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the precautionary principle gaining a foothold in California  the memo, obtained by the Environmental Working Group through an undisclosed source, recommends to ACC members that they pay US$120,000 a year to Public Relations and 'marketplace defence' firm, Nichols-Dezenhall. This firm &lt;a href="http://www.ewg.org/briefings/acc/index.php"&gt;reportedly hires former FBI and CIA agents&lt;/a&gt; to conduct selective intelligence gathering about the plans, motivations and allies of opposition. The memo says Nichols-Dezenhall would also create an independent watchdog group to act as an information clearinghouse and attack the precautionary principle laws in public and media forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo is a rare, but not unique, glimpse into the murky world of front groups, misinformation and smears that typify the lengths certain companies and industries go to prevent effective regulation. Of course the ACC website contains no reference to the memo or such tactics. The site crows about how members are signed up to its voluntary Responsible Care program to prevent harm to the environment. But scratch the surface of the programme and all is not so rosy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Responsible Care?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical is a member of the ACC. And Exxonmobil/Esso is no stranger to using front groups to undermine environmental protection. In September last year  another leaked memo revealed that the Competitive Enterprise Institute was suing the US Environmental Protection Agency seemingly with the collusion of another part of the Bush Administration. The lawsuit was an attempt to gag a report on climate change that would contradict the Bush stance of doing nothing. ExxonMobil just happens to be a leading funder of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. That will be responsible care for the climate then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat concerns over genetically engineered (GE) foods, Monsanto uses PR companies who &lt;a href="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/05/14/the-fake-persuaders/"&gt; create fake online citizens&lt;/a&gt; to denounce the scientists and environmentalists who were critical of GE crops. These &lt;a href="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/11/19/the-covert-biotech-war/"&gt; fake citizens reportedly started a campaign&lt;/a&gt; that succeeded in getting one of the world's foremost scientific journals to do something it has never done before: retract a published paper on GE contamination of crops. Monsanto is another member of the ACC. Fake online citizens and disinformation must be part of the "common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues" of Responsible Care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The much vaunted Responsible Care program is the result of the world's worst industrial disaster when a Union Carbide pesticide plant exploded in Bhopal, India, in 1984. Toxic gas leaked from the poorly maintained and understaffed plant owned by Union Carbide, killing up to 20,000 people to date and leaving 120,000 chronically ill. Dow Chemical took over Union Carbide and is a proud member of the Responsible Care program. But 20 years on the plant, abandoned on the night of the disaster, still bleeds poisons into the groundwater of the surrounding communities. Survivors have received little or no compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home Dow has been working hard to avoid cleaning up the &lt;a href="http://www.ecocenter.org/healthdow.shtml"&gt;toxic pollution around its global headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan. Dioxin pollution was discovered downstream from the plant up to 80 times the state safety level. Rather than clean it up, Dow has attempted to negotiate raising the state safety level to absolve itself of responsibility. So the residents of Bhopal and Michigan should obviously take with a large pinch of salt the claim of Responsible Care "to lead in the development of responsible laws, regulations and standards that safeguard the community, workplace and environment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you hear an 'expert' in the media expounding a point of view that sounds remarkably similar to the position of a corporate interest, check who is paying for their microphone. If you see a corporation talking up its worthy "voluntary programmes" for protecting the environment, it could just be trying to avoid government regulation that can be enforced by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>One fish, two fish, red fish, glofish?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/one-fish-two-fish-glofish/</url><text>
	The biotechnology industry has struggled for the last twenty years to come up with products that work, and propaganda to sell those products. Remember the FlavrSavr tomato, the first genetically engineered (GE) food product designed to ripen on the vine, yet stay firm all the way to market? Well, it hardly lasted the first truck ride across the country, as it really wasn't all that squash proof.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/1/glofish-may-be-the-first-genet.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/1/glofish-may-be-the-first-genet.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Glofish may be the first genetically engineered pets but with no rules to control them who knows what will happen?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as consumers around the world rejected newer GE food
crops, likeUS maize, the biotech industry came up with a novel
propagandacampaign. They are now spending millions of dollars to
convince us thatGE is an essential technology for feeding poor
people in the developingworld (never mind that most of the GE crops
currently grown are used tofeed animals, not humans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest GE product to hit the shelves illuminates the fact
thatthis technology has little to do with feeding people. Genetic
engineershave made a zebra fish that glows in the dark - the
GloFish. Of course,we wouldn't be surprised to hear the GE industry
claim that GloFishwill feed the world, revolutionise pet ownership,
and help find carkeys lost in dark aquariums the world over...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What's all the fuss about a little aquarium fish?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetically engineered organisms are novel creatures - they've
neverbefore existed on the planet. We have no way of predicting
what havocthey will cause when they are released into the wild.
Scientists havestudied what other GE fish species might do and
their conclusions areworrying - depending on the fish, GE varieties
could invade ecosystems,threaten populations of native species, or
cause other unpredictabledamage. Aquarium fish get introduced into
native ecosystems all thetime, and can survive in the warmer waters
of some springs and aroundindustrial wastewater pipes, so this
really is no laughing matter. Anyescape would be irreversible - the
escaped fish could not be recalledlike a supermarket product can be
recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Glofish are not for eating but who told the cat?" title="Glofish are not for eating but who told the cat?" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56017"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;ToddGrischke,
fisheries supervisor at the Michigan Department of
NaturalResources, likened genetically engineered fish to an
invasive species."You threaten entire ecosystems," he said. "You
don't know how thosenew animals are going to behave in the wild.
They could cause ouroriginal stocks to die off. They could be
susceptible to diseaseoutbreaks. They could change their life cycle
patterns. Who knows?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California has recently banned the sale of GloFish in the
state.Fish and Game Commissioner Sam Schuchat explained the
decision thisway: "Creating a novelty pet is a frivolous use of
this technology. Nomatter how low the risk is, there needs to be a
public benefit that ishigher than this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;But is it a fish or is it a drug?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing as it may seem, there is no agency of the US Government
thatconsiders itself responsible for evaluating the risks of GE
aquariumfish. A few years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration
(US-FDA)announced that they would regulate such fish as animal
drugs. But whenthe company selling the fish, Yorktown Technologies,
submitted a NewAnimal Drug Application to the US-FDA this year for
GloFish approval,the agency backed away from its claim to regulate
aquarium fish anddeclined to consider the application stating that
the fish was not adrug. (Those bureaucrats clearly have a firm
grasp on the obvious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget for a moment the absurdity of regulating an aquarium fish
asa drug. Regulatory agencies sometimes make bizarre definitional
leapsin order to use already existing laws to regulate completely
newproducts - like glow-in-the-dark zebra fish. What the FDA
decisionmeans is that the fish is now being sold in stores in the
US withabsolutely no review of its potential to cause damage to
theenvironment. In deciding not to regulate the fish, the US-FDA
hascreated a regulatory vacuum of immense proportions - there is
now nofederal agency responsible for assessing whether these fish,
or anyfuture genetically engineered pets, may pose environmental or
otherproblems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not to make a pun, but I think it's shedding a light on
seriousregulatory and safety issues that are not getting much
attention," saidArt Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at
the University ofPennsylvania. "This is going to be a very
important issue. The fish isjust the first wave on the beach."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 14, 2004, the Center for Food Safety and the Center
forTechnology Assessment filed a lawsuit against the US Food and
DrugAdministration and its parent agency, the US Department of
Health andHuman Services, to block the sale of the GloFish. The
lawsuitrepresents the first-ever legal action seeking to block the
sale of agenetically engineered animal. The lawsuit also asks the
court todecide that the US-FDA must regulate genetically engineered
pets.&lt;/p&gt;

	It was a tough year for the planet, and our retrospective shows plenty of cause for concern, but reason for hope and celebration as well. Look back at the protests against the war in Iraq where millions took to the streets, see how an Amazon community protected their forest land, witness the destruction of forest fires and floods in southern Europe in just 6 months and a birds eye view of protecting the tallest trees in the world.

	It was a beautiful star gazing night last night and almost everyone was out on deck. The moon rose late and the lights on deck were off because we are in transit. In the distance, against the silhouette of the forest, there was an orange glow. Coca said I hope that is the moon. I said, it isn't. I've seen it many times before on this trip, the warm orange glow on the horizon accompanied by a smoky haze in the sky. The distinct smell of burning wood hung in the air.

            The US based Cargill corporation burns large areas of rainforest  to prepare for soya plantations.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past week we documented huge deforested areas in
Santarem, many still on fire, all being cleared for soya
plantations. The aerial images confirm that the attack of private
companies on the forest continues out of control and we delivered
the images to the federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Brazil's soya market is fuelling an emerging
cycle of deforestation. Over three-quarters of a million hectares
of soya was planted within the Amazon deforestation belt by the end
of 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three forces are driving soya expansion in Para state - low land
prices, the lack of funding for an effective government inspection
infrastructure, and the construction of Cargill's soya handling
facilities in Santarem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But federal prosecutors just announced that they will launch
legal action in the federal courts calling for demolition of
Cargills' soya handling facilities in Santarem. The federal
prosecutors will also ask for the immediate suspension of the US
corporation's activities in Santarem until the courts reach their
decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Artic Sunrise in front of illegal soya processing plant." title="Artic Sunrise in front of the US based Cargill corporation's illegal soya processing plant. Cargill is fuelling the burning of the forest for soya plantations." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="55306"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Under
Brazilian law the construction of the Cargill facility required
prior preparation and approval of an Environmental Impact
Assessment. Instead of complying, they chose to contest this
requirement in the courts. After four years of court challenges,
late last month the Court of Final Instance ruled unanimously
against Cargill. However, in the interim, the multinational giant
constructed their facility in Santarem's main beach, in violation
of the law. Twenty-five families were displaced in the construction
of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the announcement, Federal Prosecutor Felicio Pontes said
"Cargill believed that because they were a powerful multinational,
they could disrespect both Brazilian legislation and the
environment. The court decision shows that they were wrong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way to go federal prosecutors - a victory for the people and the
forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the completion of the Cargill facility, one hectare of
rural land in the region cost R$50 (US$13). With the arrival of
"gauchos", as the soya producers are called, the price per hectare
skyrocketed to R$900 (US$300). Entire rural communities were
displaced, the inhabitants having sold their land rights and moved
to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our ongoing field investigations, we believe that
deforestation this year will be even higher than last year. There
is a growing and very dangerous trend appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally cattle ranchers would move into areas that loggers
had exploited, and clear the land for pastures. Empirical data now
indicates that cattle ranchers continue to push into new areas that
are being deforested, after exhaustive exploitation by loggers,
later selling the areas to the soya producers. At the same time the
soya producers are burning large tracts of the forest solely for
conversion to large-scale agriculture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="forest burning for in prepartion for soya planting." title="The US based Cargill corporation burns large areas of rainforest to prepare for soya plantations." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="55303"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Between
August 2001 and August 2002 deforestation in Brazil's Amazon
increased 40 percent compared to the previous 12 months. Analysis
of satellite images by the National Institute of Space Research
(INPE) show that the destruction dramatically expanded beyond what
is known as the "Arc of Deforestation" - that runs from the east
and south of Para state towards Acre state - and is cutting deeper
and deeper into the heart of the untouched forest. According to the
Ministry of Environment, this deforestation is a direct result of
the invasion of soya producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burning question the government must answer: do they want to
contain deforestation, support and promote sustainable
alternatives, and strengthen the Ministry of Environment, or lose
immense areas of the Amazon to predatory exploitation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, the fires rage on.&lt;/p&gt;

	A dark leader of armies stares into a crystal globe that glows with a fiery, lidless eye, his mind bent to the will of an evil that seeks power above all else. His orders: destroy an ancient wilderness of majestic and mysterious trees, for the benefit of his dark masters. As he signs the decision, you can almost hear George Bush intone in a deep, resounding voice "Rip them all down."
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            In December of 2003, George Bush opened up vast tracts of Alaska's ancient forests for logging.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound like it only happens in films? Unfortunately something
remarkably similar is happening in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep in the holidays, when little children were waiting for
magical presents and families of Men gathered to feast and
celebrate good will to all, the villain of our story, George W.
Bush (the W does not stand for Wizard) and his minions announced
plans to make rules protecting forests magically disappear. A
Clinton-administration prohibition on new roads in US National
forests was waived away with the stroke of a pen, and the largest
national forest in the US exempted from the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" width="263" height="360" id="bush-tongass" align="center"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25787/bush-tongass.swf"&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roadless rule comes from a wiser, more enlightened age and
was created with the popular support of Men. The Tongass National
Forest, in the wilderness of Alaska, has now been opened up to
plunder by hoards of logging companies intent on one thing - the
felling of the oldest and largest trees in the forest to turn into
money. In the process, they will destroy the rich habitats and
irreplaceable ecosystems that rely upon these giants of the
earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the Dark Lord hoped that an announcement of such evil
deeds during the holidays would ensure it went unnoticed by a media
that has already fallen largely under a spell of silence. The
protection of the forest was the most popular law ever written in
the US, with over two million people writing to express their
support for increased protection of the forests and their
inhabitants. The proposed change attracted over a quarter of a
million comments with 100 to 1 against logging in the Tongass. But
as George would join Saruman in saying, &lt;i&gt;"The will of Men is
weak...we must have power, power to order all things as we
will."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Bear feeding on salmon, Tongass National Forest" title="Bear feeding on salmon, Tongass National Forest" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53101"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
the dark tongue of BushSpeak, which we will not utter here, the US
President tried to claim that "only" a small percentage of the
Tongass would be opened to logging. What he fails to mention is
that the 300,000 acres that have been opened are largely in ancient
forest areas - the greatest concentrations of biodiversity,
watershed, and ecological value -- which cannot be replaced by
simply planting new trees. These areas happen to be the greatest
concentration of economic value as well, and it will be the largest
and the oldest of trees in America's last intact temperate
rainforest which will be felled - many for pulp and paper products
such as toilet paper. As Sam Gamgee would say, "There goes that
George Bush, a-fellin' trees when he ought nought to."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US Taxpayers have spent billions to construct and maintain
nearly 400,000 miles of roads in the national forests, and it will
be US taxpayers that pay for logging company's access to old growth
forests in the Tongass, adding to the $US8.5 billion the US spends
on forest road maintenance now. "Build me a road system worthy of
Mordor" would have been the Timber Industry's command via Palantir
to the White House. (Actually, they don't need a Palantir -- the
crystal globes by which Sauron commanded Saruman in the Lord of the
Rings. US Undersecretary of Agriculture Mark Rey, who drove the
exception to the roadless rule, is a former timber lobbyist.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Bald eagle, Tongass National Forest" title="Bald eagle, Tongass National Forest" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="53110"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Lord
Bush thinks he is powerful enough to continue the plunder of the
natural world unhindered. In this story there are no mythical Ents,
no Merry and Pippin, no protective spells for these forests to stop
their destruction. The only power that can stop the Dark Lord and
the forces of evil from destroying the heart of the Tongass and
other ancient forests in their plunder of the Earth is the will of
the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"It's like in the great stories, Mr.
Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger,
they were.... Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning
back, only they didn't."&lt;/p&gt;

	Across the planet glaciers are retreating as temperatures rise and weather patterns change. Our ship, the Arctic Sunrise and her crew, is currently in Patagonia to highlight the impacts of climate change on the glaciers at the tip of South America. These glaciers are the fastest retreating glaciers on the globe as our demand for oil, gas and coal changes the climate of the Earth.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are huge reserves of frozen water found in Polar
Regions andin mountainous areas. They provide water for millions of
people,animals and plants. Glaciers are dynamic, meaning they swap
betweenstages of growth and retreat but what is worrying now is
that themajority of glaciers across the globe are retreating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this melting reduce the water supplies of many
people,it causes sea levels to rise, which threatens millions with
devastatingcoastal flooding. The Patagonia glaciers and ice fields
have lost 42cubic kms of ice every year for the last seven years.
That is theequivalent to the volume of ten thousand large football
stadiums. Themelting has accelerated in recent years. Currently the
Patagonian icefields contribute to nine percent of the global sea
level rise frommountain glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our web editor Iréne has swapped the cold and ice of Stockholm
inthe winter for the, err, cold and wind of Patagonia in summer to
bringthe dramatic and worrying melting occurring in this remote
corner ofChile to the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/impacts/archives/001045.html"&gt;first
visit&lt;/a&gt;was to the stunning Grey Glacier in the National Park of
Torres delPaine. Beautiful views of blue icebergs, condors and
lamas contrastwith the tales of the glaciers retreat from the local
guide andclimbers. &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/impacts/archives/SUSANNE.MP3"&gt;Listen
to Susan&lt;/a&gt;, guide and climber in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25785/IRENE.JPG" alt="Irene in Patagonia" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt;Even
after only one week in the area the impacts of climate change start
to &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/impacts/archives/001022.html"&gt;hit
home for Iréne&lt;/a&gt;:"We've now spent a little more than a week here
in both the Chilean andArgentinean part of Patagonia. Most days
we've been up early and comeback late in the evening. We've visited
glaciers and talked to peopleliving and working in the area. This
is one of the most beautifulplaces I've ever seen, but it has also
made me very sad: climate changeis no longer something abstract -
the impacts of climate change arevery real. The glaciers are
melting at an accelerating speed andchanges can bee seen from year
to year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many of us will get the chance to visit a glacier but
climatechange means more storms, floods, droughts and rising sea
levels thatwill affect us all. Iréne sums up the situation: "I
remembered how ateacher in school illustrated the history of our
planet by unfurling aroll of toilet paper and attach it on the
classroom walls. He thenmarked the different eras on it. At the
very end, hardly visible, therewas a very small field, more like a
thin line: that was how longmankind has been around. Changes on our
planet normally happen veryslowly. During the last hundred years
however, changes have all of asudden happened very fast:
temperatures and sea levels rising,droughts, floods and melting
icefields - we are actually changing theclimate! Just think about
it for a little while."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Do something!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some governments are slowly realising that they must tackle
climatechange and are holding a conference on renewable energy in
June. Sendthem a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/patagonia/index.asp"&gt;"Postcard
from Patagonia"&lt;/a&gt; to show them you want them to tackle the
problem. We will deliver your card, frozen in a huge block of ice
to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

	Unilever, Coca Cola and McDonalds have promised to phase out climate-killing chemicals in their refrigeration equipment. This announcement shows that refrigeration can be climate friendly. However other corporations and governments continue to promote or lobby for increased use of climate-wrecking gases.

            Production of more environmentally friendly Greenfreeze refrigerators in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced the
banning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration industry
switched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While this stopped depletion
of the ozone layer, it meant introducing a new potent greenhouse
gas. It was an environmental case of "out of the frying pan into
the fire."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch and show how it should
be done we launched the concept of Greenfreeze in 1992. We met two
scientists who pointed out how to avoid HFC's altogether. We found
an old fridge factory, appealed to our supporters to pre-order
enough units to finance a refit, helped build the market and
Greenfreeze was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
and fuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never work and the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in the industry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there are over 100 million Greenfreeze refrigerators in
the world, produced by all the major European, Chinese, Japanese
and Indian manufacturers. It is now available in most major markets
with the exception of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in the
domestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued to use refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to the Sydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such as Unilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors,
to live up to the guidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after being faced with a &lt;a href="http://www.cokespotlight.org/"&gt;concerted internet campaign&lt;/a&gt;
before the 2000 Olympics to buy green refrigeration for new units.
Before the start of the games all three companies announced phase
out plans for damaging refrigeration technologies by the time of
the 2004 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these companies have announced more concrete plans for how
to phase out HFC's. Our Executive Director, Gerd Leipold welcomed
the announcement: "Greenpeace welcomes the commitments made by
Unilever, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. We call on their competitors,
such as Nestle, Pepsi and Burger King, to follow suit. But
corporate action is only half the picture. For a complete solution,
governments must act. Politicians can't sit back and wait for the
market to deliver, because on its own, it won't."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Under attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this good news the trend is looking bleak. Left
unchecked, by 2050 HFC's will do as much damage to the climate as
the traffic fumes of all the world's passenger cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To force all companies and industry to meet the high standards
of these three companies effective government regulation is the
only solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly even the current ineffective regulation of HFC's is
under attack. American industry is leading the charge for wider use
of HFC's in uses such as car air conditioners. Ford motor company
is one example of a pro-HFC's corporation. Like the US chemicals
industries meddling in new European Union chemical law, the
"European" industry lobby group for HFC's was actually set up in US
state of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The way ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies like McDonalds, Unilever and Coca Cola, who are far
from 'all round environmental angels', can go HFC free then there
is no reason why their competitors cannot follow their lead. It
also exposes the lies and misinformation spread by irresponsible
industry lobbying. Goverments should follow the progressive stance
of these three companies and adopt an immediate phase-out of
HFCs.&lt;/p&gt;

	The cryosphere is that part of the Earth made of frozen water and soil: Iceworld, if you will. And according to a new study to be published in January, it's a world that is vanishing rapidly, with potentially devastating consequences.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world in which 17 million people are fleeing sea-rise
in Bangladesh. A world in which villages that rely on glacial melt
for their water supplies become ghost towns as the last of the ice
disappears. A world in which polar bears are extinct in the wild. A
world in which entire seaside economies and livelihoods are wiped
out by a rise in sea level that is measured in meters. Now imagine
that aspects of this world could be upon us within the lifetimes of
children being born today -- and in some scenarios, in our own
lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a chilling vision of a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mass Balance of the Cryosphere" (Cambridge University Press)
has been written by a team of 23 scientists and edited by Dr
Jonathan Bamber and Dr Anthony Payne of Bristol University. It
focuses on two key components of this sensitive environment: land
ice, in the form of ice sheets, caps and glaciers, and sea ice.
These are important indicators of both short and long-term climate
change. The book warns that the cryosphere is far more sensitive to
climate change than has been generally accepted, and that we ignore
at our peril the dramatic and disturbing trends that have already
been observed globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the findings in the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greenland ice sheet - the biggest ice mass in the Northern
Hemisphere - is melting around its margins. Some climate models
predict it could lose half its mass in the next 500-1000 years,
contributing 3 m to global sea level rise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The amount of Arctic summer sea ice has reduced dramatically in
the past 20 years and could disappear completely within an
estimated 100 years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Globally mountain and alpine glaciers everywhere are melting,
except for a few glaciers in Europe that are not retreating. The
rate of retreat is expected to accelerate over the next
century.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Antarctica - the largest ice mass in the world - presents a
more complex picture, although parts of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet and Peninsula ice shelves are in decline.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Evidence indicates that some of the changes being seen in the
cryosphere are related to the underlying man-made component of
global warming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Who needs ice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Polar bears, already under stress from climate change, could become extinct" title="Polar bears, already under stress from climate change, could become extinct" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="42169"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
implications of the decline of the cryosphere are far reaching and
go beyond merely losing snow and ice. Increased fresh water
influxes from the Arctic could trigger a slow down or diversion of
currents of the North Atlantic. What's commonly known as the Gulf
Stream is a part of a "conveyor belt" which brings warm water from
the Gulf of Mexico to the shores of Europe, circles up to the
Arctic, then plunges back into the deep ocean for another cycle.
Without its warming effect, North Western Europe would have a
climate similar to Greenland. Changes to the North Atlantic
currents could impact other sea currents and temperatures around
the globe, setting off chain-reaction climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As icesheets retreat, snow which once reflected sunlight and
heat back into the atmosphere gives way to earth and rock which
absorb its heat. As a result, we may well see accelerated warming
in the Arctic, and with it accelerated melt. As the ice disappears,
habitats for Arctic animals such as polar bears, seals and other
large predators are lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much of the cryosphere is lost, global sea
level rise could be measurable in metres. A sea level rise of only
1.5m would displace up to 17 million people in Bangladesh
alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond the icesheets, glacial retreats in many parts of the
world will mean reduced water for human consumption, agriculture
and hydro-electricity, shifting economic and social patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sea Ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="42028"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;There
are warning signs that during the latter half of the 20th Century
the Arctic has undergone substantial climate change. One of the key
indicators is sea ice extent and thickness, both of which have
shown a measurable and disturbing decrease during the last half of
the century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If summer rates of ice decrease continue or accelerate there
could, potentially, be no summer sea ice in the Arctic within 100
years or less. This will have major impacts on energy and moisture
exchange and consequently on the climate of the Northern
Hemisphere, including the risk of altering or slowing down the Gulf
Stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of such dramatic changes in sea ice cover are
the subject of a number of climate modelling studies and it is,
currently, too early to say precisely what the implications of
these changes might be. However such changes are likely to include
impacts on wildlife and indigenous populations, as well as
increasing the positive feedback of higher temperatures as the ice
disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is general agreement that acceleration in melting globally
will take place over the next century if greenhouse gas emissions
continue to accelerate at the rate they have done for the past 50
to 100 years. Extrapolation of the present trend suggests a
reduction in area of the Arctic sea ice of 4.7 million square km by
2100, i.e. virtually complete elimination of the Arctic ice pack in
summer. If the predictions of warming in the Arctic over the same
time period are taken into account, the rate of melting could be
considerably faster as the Arctic is particularly sensitive to
temperature increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lower elevations in Greenland, ice sheet loss is
conservatively estimated to be 50 cubic km/year, which is
equivalent to 0.13 mm/year of sea level rise. As most ice sheet
data has been collected only over the past few decades or less, it
is difficult to know how long this negative imbalance has existed
but it has certainly been enhanced by the warming during the 1990s,
and the record melt extent observed in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thinning rates cannot be explained by increased surface
melting alone, so the implication is that something else is causing
this. Extensive thinning in several separate areas suggests that
this may be climatically induced, for example, by increased surface
melt water reaching the bedrock on which the ice sits, causing the
ice to slide on its bed. If true, this is of profound significance
as it suggests that the dynamic response time of the ice sheet is,
potentially, much shorter than previously believed. Such a rapid
dynamic response to changing climate has not, to date, been
satisfactorily incorporated in modelling studies, nor have the
complex interactions between ice, the oceans, and the atmosphere.
All of which means that ice loss could in fact be much faster and
greater than currently predicted. This could mean that some of the
impacts previously predicted to occur hundreds of years in the
future could happen much faster, perhaps within a century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Antarctic Ice Sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Crack in the Larsen B ice shelf" title="Crack in the Larsen B ice shelf" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="42556"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;While
the East Antarctic Ice Sheet appears to be close to balance; it is
a different story on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been a
significant warming on the peninsula of about 4 degrees Celsius in
the last 50 years, associated with a regional decline in sea ice.
While this is a strong signal, it's quite localised. Ice shelves
along the Peninsula are only a few hundred metres thick and float
on the surface of the ocean and are quite sensitive to changes in
the ocean temperature and ocean circulation. Two major ice shelf
collapses have been observed over the last decade along the
Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Glaciers and ice caps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water stored in glaciers and icecaps around the world would
contribute 0.5m sea level rise if they all melted. This is small
compared to the 68.3m sea level rise that total melting of the
Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets would cause (6m and 62m,
respectively). However, glaciers respond much more rapidly than ice
sheets. Glacier and ice cap response times are typically below 100
years, which means that the bulk of the cryosphere's contribution
to human-induced sea-level rise over the coming century is likely
to come from these types of ice mass. There are more than 160,000
glaciers worldwide, making measurement of glacier mass balance very
difficult, but existing research indicates that glacial loss is
responsible for between 0.22mm to 0.25mm a year sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex analysis is needed to understand how glaciers react
once melting begins, and what a partial loss of glacier ice would
mean for its water flow system. The assessment of historical and
predicted future contributions to sea level from glaciers is still
in its infancy. Changes in ice amounts have clearly been large and
are likely to continue to be important over the coming century,
however many challenges still remain in their accurate
measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sea ice loss - one example of how this might affect the environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="41590"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;According
to the Third Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), a reduction in sea ice will reduce ice
edges, which are prime habitat for marine organisms. Habitat loss
for some species of seal, walrus, and polar bear results from ice
melt, and animals at the top of the food chain - with their
low-reproductive rates - are vulnerable to changes in the polar
marine food chains. Some animals may be threatened (e.g., walrus,
polar bear, and some species of seal), whereas others may flourish
(e.g., some species of fish and penguins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Andrew DeRocher of the University of Alberta,
who is a world authority on polar bears, if the sea ice habitat
continues to deteriorate at current rates, polar bears and their
prey, such as ringed and bearded seals, would be unlikely to retain
their current population sizes and distribution. At some point, if
the loss of sea ice became so severe that all the Arctic sea ice
was lost for a substantial part of the year, we may lose polar
bears as a wild species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole Arctic marine ecosystem is tied to the presence and
dynamics of the sea ice. The main productivity bloom that occurs
each spring is exploited by both resident species and migrants,
which is tied to the melting of the annual sea ice. Some arctic
species travel halfway around the world to exploit the food sources
that flourish along the edge of the melting ice. Life along the
edge of the melting sea ice is the basis of Arctic marine
ecosystems. Removing this dynamic would have profound consequences
for all marine life. If the sea ice is drastically reduced or the
timing changed, we can expect the loss of many species that are
reliant upon this special habitat. It is likely that we will see
species expand from southern latitudes to occupy some of these
environments but it is impossible to say which ones. It is hard to
understand the dynamics of Arctic ecosystems and even harder to
predict with any certainty what may happen if the climate changes
substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What causes climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Floods in Czechia" title="Floods in Czechia" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="43348"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Climate
change is directly linked to our fossil energy consumption. Global
warming of the earth is the result of increasing greenhouse gas
emissions. The principal cause is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is
released when fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas are
burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 the IPCC issued its Third Assessment Report, which found
new and stronger evidence that most of the observed warming of the
past 50 years is attributable to human activities. It found that
about three-quarters of the anthropogenic (human created) emissions
of CO2 during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC also reported that the average global temperature was
projected to rise between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius in the next
100 years. This is a large increase over projections in the Second
Assessment Report (1995), which estimated the increase in
temperature to be between 1 and 3.5 degrees. In addition,
predictions suggest that this warming will be larger in the polar
regions, exacerbating the worrying trends already observed. A
2-degree increase would produce substantial damage to or loss of
many natural ecosystems, lead to spread of diseases such as malaria
and cause substantial damage to agriculture in developing
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific understanding of the Earth's climate and how humans
are affecting it is constantly improving, but there is still much
to learn about what climate change will mean to natural systems
such as the cryosphere. For most people polar regions are remote
places that are out of sight and perhaps out of mind. They are,
however, highly sensitive to climate change with strong feedbacks
at play. Dramatic and disturbing trends have already been observed
in the Arctic, Greenland, the Antarctic Peninsula and in glaciers
globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk of sea level rise that could displace millions of people;
radical alterations of ocean currents that in turn affect regional
climate; loss of glaciers that provide water people need to live;
changes to the food chain and even possible dramatic and rapid
irreversible changes to the global climate - these are some of the
possible impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the one global mechanism to address
climate change. As the latest round of Kyoto talks get underway in
Milan in December 2003, evidence about the serious impact of
climate change is mounting. Governments and industry must take
action to protect the climate now and stop trying to weaken the
Protocol. It is not only the cryosphere at risk, but also
potentially the global climate system.&lt;/p&gt;

	Attendees of the World Food Business Summit in Rome, Italy were 'welcomed' today by hundreds of audio messages from consumers in all 25 EU nations saying that they didn't want GE in their food.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists at the World Food Business Summit in Rome, Italy  say no to GMOs
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording was blasted into the conference at the Hilton
Hotel, which is being attended by the world's top food executives.
The recording was in over 20 languages so our friends at the top
can have no excuses about misunderstanding the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive the point home our activists also abseiled down from
the Hilton roof with banners reading 'GE Food is bad business'
while others representing the 25 EU nations were outside the summit
carrying the message, 'Listen to consumers: No to GMOs in our food,
feed and fields'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of interested delegates came out to see what the action
was about, however our activists noticed that they had covered up
their identity badges. Whether the delegates did this because they
didn't want their company to be associated with such an activity is
unclear. One thing is for sure though transparency with regard to
GE is not part of their corporate language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just in Europe that consumers don't want to eat GE,
recent Deloitte research on US consumer attitudes found that 67
percent of US consumers are concerned about eating GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Poll after poll has shown that a majority of consumers prefer
GE-free food, and an even bigger majority of consumers want GE food
to at least be labelled, including in China and the US," commented
Federica Ferrario of Greenpeace Italy. 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Activists hand a banner off the Hilton in Rome" title="Activists hand a banner off the Hilton in Rome" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="61869"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we never see is consumers demanding GE food, begging the
million dollar question: how come the global food industry isn't
doing more to make sure supply meets demand rather than force
feeding GE food to consumers?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global food industry often acts as a barrier to the
introduction of GE labelling legislation by claiming that sourcing
non-GE ingredients is next to impossible or that GE labelling is
unfeasible or prohibitively expensive. These claims are totally
inaccurate and misleading to consumers. They only serve to hide the
fact that non-GE ingredients are, or can be, plentiful and that GE
labelling, far from being impossible, has been implemented in
Europe for years and has not resulted in any consumer-end price
increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government, while attacking European GE labelling and
safety legislation via the WTO, is denying its own citizens the
basic right to know when GE ingredients are used in their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy is supported by the main food trade association and
its members, many of whom are present at the Rome meeting. They
insist on being dishonest about the realities of GE labelling and
sourcing non-GE ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"US and Canadian companies along with their trade associations
should stop deliberately obstructing the introduction of GE
labelling legislation in North America. What are they scared of? Do
they believe that consumers in the U.S. will reject GE food in the
same way European consumers are showing today, if they are given
the choice?" said our international GE campaigner Lindsay
Keenan.&lt;/p&gt;

	They already had the opinion of thousands of scientists and a coalition of environment and wildlife groups. Then we gave them a petition signed by over 6000 cyberactivists.  If that wasn't enough, the Rainbow Warrior documented actual hard evidence of the destruction of protected species in the Tasman Sea and beamed it all the way to New York.  But still, the UN has this week failed to seize a crucial opportunity to halt high-seas bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/unwanted-bycatch-including-a.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/unwanted-bycatch-including-a.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unwanted bycatch, including a starfish, far outweighs the target catch of orange roughy in a deep sea trawl from international waters in the Tasman Sea. Greenpeace  along with more than a thousand scientists are supporting the call for a moratorium  on high seas bottom trawling, because of the vast amount of marine life that is destroyed by this fishing method.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had a real opportunity to act and they failed," said Karen
Sack of Greenpeace. "We need immediate action to save the deep sea
from being bulldozed by fishing vessels from a handful of
countries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several delegations blocked moves to prohibit high seas bottom
trawling - the world's most destructive fishing practice - under
pressure from fisheries ministries in their countries. Iceland and
Japan were particularly vocal in opposition. The measure was
replaced with a weak recommendation that nations "consider" an
interim prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions were all taking place at this week's UN
meeting in New York which had the power to recommend an immediate
halt on bottom trawling to the UN General Assembly. Greenpeace
members were out in force distributing footage from the Rainbow
Warrior showing the devastating effects of bottom trawling and
ensuring that the opinions of our cyberactivists were visible even
in the corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all bad though - governments from virtually every
region of the world expressed support for a prohibition on bottom
trawling. Particularly strong calls for action to halt bottom
trawling were made by Norway, Thailand, Costa Rica, the Republic of
Palau, and Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the last you've heard on bottom trawling,
we will be continuing our defence of the millions of rare,
protected and undiscovered species in the deep sea, so stay tuned
...&lt;/p&gt;

	Throughout the world, ancient forests are under threat. Many of the plants and animals that live in these forests face extinction. And many of the people and cultures who depend on these forests for their way of life are at risk. We are taking action now to stop the destruction around the world. Join us.

            Greenpeace activists uncover a shipment of conflict timber on the MV Mentor in the Italian port of Salerno.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Action Updates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday 23rd June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists early this morning climbed onboard the timber transport vessel "Tradco" in Ravenna, Italy. At 5.00 hours 25 activists locked themselves to the ship's cranes thus preventing any off-loading of timber from African forests. Banners that read: "Save the Ancient Forests" and "Forest Crime" were displayed from the cranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timber on board comes from the rainforests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa. The Congo Basin forms the last big intact forests of Africa, a region of very high ecological value upon which many forest dwelling communities depend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy is a major importer of timber coming from African rainforest destruction. Industrial logging in Africa is often carried out in a highly destructive way and illegal logging is rampant in the entire region. Logging often creates major social conflicts and it is the driving factor for the commercial bushmeat trade in the region, which is now rapidly wiping out endangered animals such as forest elephants, chimpanzees and lowland gorillas. Italy is doing very little to prevent such imports, especially from companies involved in this deliberate destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday 13th June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists intercepted a transport vessel carrying timber from the rainforests in Cameroon. Activists from onboard the Rainbow Warrior, the Greenpeace flagship, prevented the M.V. "Honour" from entering the Valencia harbour in Spain. Activists are currently secured on Harbour Pilot ladders and on the cranes of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Honour is transporting timber from Cameroon, a country that is plagued by poor governance, lack of transparency in the timber sector and illegal logging," said Miguel Angel Soto from onboard the Rainbow Warrior. "Industrial logging is destroying the habitat of endangered species such as the Forest Elephant and the Western Lowland Gorilla."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a new European Commission Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, but it does not adequately address the severity of illegal logging. Notably, it falls short on implementing new legislation to ban the trade in illegally harvested timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"European governments should rightfully be undertaking the task that Greenpeace performs today," added Soto. "New legislation is needed in Europe to block the importation of illegal and destructive timber."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destruction of the world's last ancient forests robs local peoples of the resources needed for their survival. We are campaigning to protect the world's remaining ancient forests by promoting ecologically sustainable and social responsible forest use and the establishment of protected areas. Protected forest areas should be dedicated to the conservation of their biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and should be established and managed respecting traditional land rights--particularly those of indigenous peoples. They should be protected from road building and industrial activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 4th June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?ucidparam=20030604082106&amp;amp;MenuPoint=D-G-D"&gt; occupied the construction site&lt;/a&gt; of the new UK Home Office HQ in London and declared it an ancient forest crime scene. Eleven climbers scaled and occupied four huge cranes on the site and hung banners saying 'Rainforest Demolition Site'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our investigation revealed that Government contractors are using illegal and destructively logged plywood from Indonesia's last remaining rainforests. The plywood - used for the site hoardings and to hold wet concrete in place while it sets - has been supplied by timber barons notorious for illegal logging, environmental destruction, corruption and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;For more information &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/"&gt;visit the UK site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists boarded a riverboat in Middle land Channel in Germany as it attempted to deliver timber from the last ancient forests of Africa. Twenty-four activists climbed on to the Riverboat "Ilmenau" loaded with timber from Liberia. Activists also chained themselves to the cranes of the Wagner Company, owner of the timber. Liberian timber is contentious as it is believed to be a major trading item in the armed conflict in that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time more activists in Barcelona delivered a log from Liberia to the government offices in Catalonia to protest against Spain's involvement in the destruction of those sensitive forests. The log belongs to the Maderas Perarnau from Carnet de Mar, a company trading timber from Liberia where revenues from timber exports are used to fuel armed conflict, and timber from Careroonian timber exporters heavily involved in illegal logging. Maderas Perarnau belongs to the Spanish Association of Timber Importers (AEIM) who has a "code of conduct" not to buy timber from dubious sources. Greenpeace has repeatedly asked the company to stop buying Liberian timber and illegal timber in general without response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Amazon Rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists in Germany exposed evidence of rainforest destruction and contamination from the WestLB Bank's investment in an oil pipeline that runs through Ecuador's Amazon rainforest. The activists laid out a red carpet with oil stains and placed yellow oil drums before the head office of what is the biggest German public bank to demonstrate the extent of the destruction of the rainforest by German investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the evidence of WestLB's true record," said Sandra Pfotenhauer Greenpeace campaigner on the scene. "Contaminated rivers that flow through what until recently was a pristine forest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/deutschland/?page=/deutschland/news/waelder/oeliger-empfang-zur-bilanz-der-westlb"&gt;For more information visit the German site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;African Rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists onboard the Rainbow Warrior uncovered approximately 8000 cubic metres of criminal timber from Liberia, Cameroon and the Congo in Sète, France. France is the largest importer of tropical timber in Europe. Once on the French market, almost one quarter of the imported timber is used in government buildings and projects. Each year, about 120,000 tonnes of tropical wood arrives in Sète. Most of it comes from Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberian timber is now recognised by the United Nations Security Council for fuelling a bloody regional conflict in West Africa. After two years of campaigning by Greenpeace and Global Witness, the UN Security Council imposed further sanctions on Liberia to include a ban on all exports of timber. Until the decision last week, France had not acted upon the concerns expressed by Greenpeace and Global Witness about the import of conflict timber. The French government must now do everything possible to stop the import of such timber and other timber coming from the destruction of the ancient forests around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

DLH is currently continuing to import Liberian timber. Take action for the forest today by sending a letter to the CEO asking him to stop all Liberian timber imports now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Amazon Rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon rainforest is more than ancient trees and endangered species. It is home for millions of people and their way of life is often threatened by forest destruction. This was the case for the Deni Indians whose land was under threat by a foreign logging company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deni Indians live in a remote area of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, a community of little more than 600 people. They have had little contact with the outside world and their way of life - food, fishing, even religious beliefs - are all intricately linked to the forest that surrounds them. But their community was threatened several years ago when a Malaysian logging company illegally purchased logging rights that overlapped with the Deni territory. The Deni fought back, determined to protect the forest they depend on and their unique culture. And now they have won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=242589"&gt;Read more about their courageous story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;African Rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people know diamonds are not best friends with regional stability in West Africa, the timber industry quietly stepped in to support arms trafficking in Liberia both logistically and financially. But after two years of intense campaigning, the United Nations Security Council has extended sanctions on Liberia to include timber exports that fuel arms trafficking, paramilitary activity, environmental destruction and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Canada's Temperate Rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed as ten-feet tall trees, activists marched on the British Columbia legislature in Victoria in a reenactment from a scene in Lord of the Rings, Two Towers, where walking trees, known as Ents, rise up to overthrow the regime of the malevolent lord, who devastated the forests for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Much like Saruman in Lord of the Rings, Premier Gordon Campbell seems intent on destroying our ancient forests," said Tamara Stark, Greenpeace's forests campaign coordinator in Canada. "The government wants to hand over half the land mass of British Columbia to logging companies and other developers and if these policies go through, Beautiful BC - like Middle Earth - will become a land of stumps."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Finland's Ancient Forests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in a wealthy, forest rich nation like Finland, industrial logging is jeopardising the survival of the country's last ancient forests. Forests which are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami people and other communities. Over 500 species are also threatened due to deforestation. This logging is driven by the country's massive international paper industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists from nine countries protested the import of paper from Finnish forests onboard the freighter "Finnhawk" in the Baltic Sea near Luebeck, Germany. The Finnish government continues to log Finland's rare and vulnerable forest habitats despite calls from scientists and conservationists for increased protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;African Rainforests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked into the nook of Africa's western coastline, Cameroon's landscape is a contradiction of dry and vast savannahs in the north and humid, dense tropical forests in the south. Ecologically and culturally, Cameroon is extremely rich. More than 200 ethnic groups make their homes in Cameroon. And the area has a particularly high diversity of wildlife - over 400 mammal species, almost 700 bird species and countless species of plants. But in this region, illegal and destructive logging practices are the norm and three Dutch companies are at the heart of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en//news/details?item%5fid=221483"&gt;Read more about illegal logging in Cameroon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once African sawn timber arrives on the market, it is impossible for customers to verify whether it is legal. Logs from legal and illegal sources are easily mixed and could be processed together in Cameroon sawmills or at their destination. What you can do is make sure that any timber products you buy are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™ or FSC®.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC is an international non-profit organisation that issues certificates for well managed forests and was created so that corporate buyers and individual consumers can identify products coming from responsible forest management. Look for the FSC logo to the left on wood products to make sure you aren't buying forest destruction or supporting illegal logging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Monsanto wins right to genetic pollution</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/monsanto-wins-right-to-pollute/</url><text>
	After years of fighting against bio-tech giant Monsanto,  Percy Shmeiser, a Canadian farmer who Monsanto claims did not acquire a licence to grow his crop of canola, has lost his appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/monsanto-took-percy-shmeiser-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/monsanto-took-percy-shmeiser-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monsanto took Percy Shmeiser to court because their crop contaminated his field.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 5-4 decision, the Canadian Supreme Court held that Mr.
Schmeiser had violated Monsanto's patent by planting seed from GE
canola that had been found on his farm the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a sad day for farmers worldwide," said Pat Venditti,
our Genetic Engineering campaigner in Canada. "Monsanto's canola
has been contaminating the fields of Western Canada for years now,
as there is no way to contain their transgenic pollution.
Unfortunately, the Court has held that Monsanto can keep polluting
farmers' fields and keep menacing them with costly lawsuits.
Farmers should be able to keep their fields GE-free, but the Court
has held that's a decision best left to Monsanto."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Schmeiser discovered, while routinely spraying
herbicide along a ditch, that some of his canola plants had become
herbicide-resistant - contaminated by pollen from Monsanto's
patented herbicide-resistant canola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 1998, Monsanto launched a lawsuit against Schmeiser
for patent infringement, alleging that Schmeiser had acquired and
planted seeds containing patented genes without a license, and then
sold harvested seed, thus infringing the company's patent. Mr.
Schmeiser has become a globally known figure during his long legal
battle with Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three main issues were deliberated by the Canadian Supreme
Court:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)The validity and scope of genetic patents - whether or not
life forms may be patented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What kind of use constitutes infringement? Schmeiser argued
that since he never sprayed his plants with Monsanto's Roundup, and
thus never took advantage of the crop's herbicide resistance, he
never benefited in any way from the presence of Monsanto's patented
material in his crops. In this case, Schmeiser argued that as he
did not exploit Monsanto's invention, he did not infringe
Monsanto's patent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The "innocent bystander" problem. Schmeiser argued that where
patented material passively and inadvertently mixes with personal
property, the property holder should not be held accountable to the
patent holder. Instead, in such cases the innocent bystander should
be protected by an implied license from the patent holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Genetic contamination from genetically engineered canola is
rampant," continued Mr. Venditti. "Monsanto has introduced an
uncontrollable crop with no liability to farmers or the public.
This ignores the widespread contamination being caused by Monsanto.
The decision of the court essentially makes farmers liable to
Monsanto for Monsanto's own genetic pollution. It means that
Monsanto can reach into farmers' fields and steal their profits and
livelihoods."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision follows two major setbacks for Monsanto, who
announced last week they would back off on plans to commercialise
GE wheat globally and GE canola in Australia after strong consumer
and industry resistance to the crops. In a small win for Schmeiser,
he will not be required to pay Monsanto for the seed or legal costs
relating to the case.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Busted!  New Zealand trawlers caught in the act</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bottom-trawlers-caught-red-ha/</url><text>
	Looks like somebody was throwing us a red herring. Last week, Greenpeace activists targeted the Nelson, New Zealand headquarters of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC) in a peaceful protest against destructive bottom trawling. Their Chief Executive denied operating in international waters.  But guess what our ship, Rainbow Warrior, just found?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The catch is hauled aboard the NZ deep sea trawler Corsair in international waters in the Tasman sea.  The red fish is orange roughy, the rest is mostly bycatch to be discarded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-presents-6000-stron/"&gt; &lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior located the Amaltal Voyager, Westbay, and Corsair around 350 miles off the coast of New Zealand on the Northwest Challenger Plateau. The plot thickens: it turns out that the Amaltal Fishing Company is a shareholder of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;previous bravado&lt;/a&gt;, the bottom trawling industry doesn't seem to want to communicate. The occupants of the three ships haven't responded to our contact via radio - except occasionally with, shall we say, "impolite" hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our intrepid Greenpeace activists documented the fishing activities on the high seas in the face of an unexpectedly large swell and a little subsequent seasickness, a different type of Greenpeace delegation began talks at the UN to secure a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. New Zealand will now be in the hot seat since all of the vessels revealed by the Rainbow Warrior were registered in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="61239"&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government has yet to say whether it will support or oppose a moratorium but they must be feeling the heat in New York at the moment," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, from aboard the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at a UN press conference delegates were treated to a rare broadcast from on board the Rainbow Warrior giving them a first hand look at the activists at work. Many scientists also made presentations at the conference - in fact over a thousand of them are supporting the call for a moratorium on bottom trawling because of the absolute devastation caused by this fishing technique. Many species have not even been described or discovered before they are fished out, while ancient corals and sponges are decimated, with little chance of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are only a small number of nations responsible for this environmental devastation," said Karen Sack, Greenpeace International Oceans Policy Advisor, at the UN. "While they reap rich rewards, the biodiversity of the least protected area of this planet is being wiped out. That is why the United Nations must impose an immediate moratorium on bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McDonald's NZ goes GE-free</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mcdonald-s-does-the-right-thin/</url><text>
	Greenpeace New Zealand announced the end of its public campaign against  McDonald's following the fast food giant's statement that it will seek non-genetically-engineered feed for its chicken products.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/mcdonalds-backs-down-in-new-ze.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/mcdonalds-backs-down-in-new-ze.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            McDonald's backs down on GE in New Zealand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our GE campaigner Steve Abel in New Zealand stated that:
"McDonald's has given us a position statement consistent with the
stance the company has taken in Europe which urges its chicken
suppliers to source non genetically engineered (GE) soya feed, and
we understand that is due to happen for the immediate future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inghams (which supplies McDonald's its poultry) has stated to
McDonald's that their next two shipments of soya meal into New
Zealand are to be sourced from a non-GE contaminated region of
Brazil. We will be keeping a close eye on these shipments and
seeking independent testing of the soy to demonstrate its non-GE
purity. And we will continue to campaign for an ongoing commitment
from Inghams to source non-GE feed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in New Zealand undertook a four-week public campaign
which targeted McDonald's stores throughout the country with
chicken-suited activists and a Ronald McDonald look-alike who
staged a mock resignation. The clown was later arrested for
blockading the 'golden arch' gates of McDonald's Wiri Distribution
Centre. The campaign urged McDonald's to take a position on GE
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the campaign has been humorous and good-natured, the
issue itself is a serious environmental one," says Abel. "GE crops
have led to an increase in herbicide use, lower yields, weed
problems and contamination of conventional and organic crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/ronaldarrest3.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;McDonald's has
already been proactive in sourcing non-GE derived ingredients for
their products over the last three years. "We commend McDonald's
for its efforts to date in ensuring the food ingredients it serves
are non-GE derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for McDonald's to request that its chicken supplier
seek a non-GE feed supply is more good news for both the
environment and for the public's GE-free food preference.
McDonald's has listened and responded positively to Greenpeace and
the public," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams however is not prepared to make a public statement and
will continue to import GE contaminated soya to Australia due to
claimed difficulties with the Brazilian port where the non- GE soya
is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/RonaldGE.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;"Inghams won't
commit to sourcing non-GE soya for the longer term but it has told
McDonald's that its next two shipments to New Zealand are non-GE,
which is a good start. However we will certainly keep up the
pressure for Inghams to commit to an ongoing and trans-Tasman
non-GE soya supply," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's largest poultry producer, Tegel, has been sourcing
a high standard Identity Preserved (IP) supply of non-GE soya from
the US since 2001. This comes at a premium of up to US$30 dollars
per tonne. Inghams is apparently not prepared to pay this premium
for the non-GE US supply so has sought less costly, non-GE
Brazilian soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/ge/kit.html"&gt;Trolley
Watch&lt;/a&gt; and keep GE food out of the supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

	Tourists got more than they bargained for this morning when they turned up at Spanish architect Gaudi's landmark cathedral, Sagrada Familia, in Barcelona. Greenpeace activists, clinging to the famous spires like orange-clad gargoyles, had added a splash of colour that even Gaudi hadn't imagined by hanging large banners saying "SOS" and "Save Our Seas" in a bid to catch the attention of the UN Environment meeting happening just down the road.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace climbers scale the top of the main towers of the cathedral La Sagrada Familia (The Sacred Family) and unfurl banners which read SAVE OUR SEAS.The action is timed for The Program of United Nations for the Environment in Barcelona, where discussion will take place for the future of the world's oceans.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/extra/?forward%5fdestination%5fanchor=%2finternational%5fen%2fnews%2fdetails%3fcampaign%255fid%3d%26item%255fid%3d490662&amp;amp;campaign%5fid=&amp;amp;forward%5fsource%5fanchor=Newsdetails&amp;amp;item%5fid=495376"&gt;
&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25 activists from the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and
Belgium were out in force in Barcelona this morning. Some scaled
the menacing Sagrada Familia cathedral towers (despite a slightly
hair-raising wind) to hang banners and others wearing "SOS"
t-shirts handed out information on deep-sea bottom trawling to
tourists below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Politicans and officials are meeting down the road to discuss
our oceans for World Environment Day on June 5th, but we want real
action, not just more talk," said Kate Nustedt, Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want a real outcome. We want a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Environment Day has an Oceans theme this year, and next
week there is also an important UN Oceans meeting in New York. So
if you think you've noticed a bit of a pattern recently you're not
wrong - we are ramping up our Oceans campaign, and the net is
tightening around irresponsible fishing companies and governments.
Earlier in the week &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=485016"&gt;
the Rainbow Warrior left New Zealand on a deep sea mission&lt;/a&gt;,
activists in New Zealand had a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;roughing-up
courtesy of the Orange Roughy Management Company&lt;/a&gt;, the Icelandic
government announced that it is &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=486962"&gt;
scaling down its "scientific" whaling&lt;/a&gt; due to "domestic
pressure" and today ... the launch of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;brand spanking new
Oceans site: Save Our Seas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;Save our
Seas&lt;/a&gt; features an interactive map and fascinating facts - get to
know the delightful snot eel which eats its dinner from the inside
out, find out why 100 million sharks are killed each year and why
tainted seafood costs US$7.2 billion a year. A key focus on the
site is also the fascinating and largely undiscovered deep sea
world which is currently under threat from bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="/international/PageFiles/25935/map.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we will be presenting over 4700 names of
cyberactivists from around the globe to the UN Consultative Process
in New York which can help us secure a moratorium on the most
destructive fishing process in our ocean today - bottom
trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone recognises that our oceans are in crisis. We can't
continue to exploit them in this way, " said Carmen Gravatt,
Greenpeace oceans campaigner, speaking from the Rainbow Warrior.

<item><language>en</language><title>EU forest crime scene exposed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-forest-crime-scene/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit have descended on the swanky refurbished EU buildings in Brussels after undercover investigations revealed that wood used in their renovation originated from companies associated with the illegal and destructive Indonesian timber trade.  We decided to get out the power tools and do a little 'renovation' of our own. Now the buildings have a fresh forest-friendly look rather than sporting illegal timber straight from the homes of tigers and orang-utans.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Greenpeace activists build an FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) plywood blockade outside the EU social and general HQ, Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 50 activists, from across Europe, cordoned off the area
around the buildings with colourful 'forest crime scene' tape,
while climbers rappelled off the buildings and redecorated with a
banner saying 'EU: Stop Illegal Timber'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="59694"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists also boarded up the building with plywood
(environmentally sustainable this time) in an effort to halt
construction while the forest crime scene is further investigated,
and in true 'Changing Rooms' style spruced up meeting rooms by
removing suspect timber from the floorboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our self-made refurbishers then rather helpfully delivered a
load of environmentally friendly wood to the EU building to show
contractors what they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Indonesia's rainforests should be home to orang-utans and
tigers, not EU bureaucrats in plush offices and chambers," said
Gavin Edwards of Greenpeace International. "Not only does the EU
allow the import of illegal wood into Europe, it is fuelling the
trade in illegal and destructive timber through its own building
projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edwards added that if Greenpeace could source environmentally
friendly timber to board up the buildings, then surely the EU could
find some for their renovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59688"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 90 percent of the logging in Indonesia is estimated to be
illegal, which means that logging is happening in national parks
and protected areas, and conflicts with local communities are
widespread. Forest products in the EU Economic and Social Committee
(ECOSOC) building include wood from RSK, IKMM and Mujur, all of
whom trade timber from the last rainforests of Kalimantan and
Sumatra, and AFR, a company shown to obtain timber from a protected
tiger reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;"The Commission attaches great [importance] to the requirement to ensure that timber is provided from environmentally sustainable sources, and now has in place arrangements to ensure that this requirement is respected" - Neil Kinnock, Vice President of the EU Commission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of discussion, the EU adopted an action plan in 2003
to tackle the trade in illegal timber. However, rather than
prioritising new legislation to outlaw such imports, its approach
focuses primarily on pretty toothless voluntary agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="59700"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the EU really wants to end forest destruction and poverty in
vulnerable regions, it means closing the European market to all
illegal wood products and taking tough measures that will allow
authorities to prosecute companies and individuals involved," said
Greenpeace EU policy adviser, Sebastien Risso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Ready for some of your own DIY?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1414&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;Tell
the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström&lt;/a&gt;, to

<item><language>en</language><title>Control your chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/the-chemical-house-2/</url><text>
	If you don't want to buy products containing toxic chemicals, how do you avoid them? Can you assume companies don't put toxic chemicals in their products? Unfortunately many large companies would rather keep secrets than inform consumers. Can you check the label? Nope, little or no information there. Can you rely on current laws and regulations? Bad luck - there's currently little protection on offer. So what can you do?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/greenpeace-s-chemical-house-da.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/greenpeace-s-chemical-house-da.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace's Chemical House database helps consumers select less toxic alternatives
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reckon that if you want something done right, you have to do
it yourself. That's why we are producing "red and green" lists of
consumer products based on their toxic content, the amount of
information the company is willing to provide, and how much the
company is prepared to do to remedy the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Make a new non-toxic shopping list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our "red and green" list covers products sold in Europe and by
many global multinational companies. When you go out shopping you
can now go armed with the information you need to make informed
choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Browse &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/chemicalhouse.cfm"&gt;the Chemical House&lt;/a&gt; and find out what exactly is lurking in your home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised at how many products you use each and
every day contain dangerous chemicals. But now you can use consumer
power to pressure companies into cleaning up their act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We ... want to encourage manufacturers to step up their efforts
to phase out hazardous substances and give consumers a wider choice
of greener products," says Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International
toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exposing the companies that use hazardous chemicals, and
showing which of their competitors are making efforts to eliminate
or replace these nasties, we aim to inform consumers about the true
contents of products. In April, we released the results of
laboratory tests conducted on Disney children's wear, which found
harmful substances present in some Disney pyjamas, T-shirts and
underwear. Despite global pressure on Disney, they have not
responded with a policy to phase out harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Mickey on the dock in Brussels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60024"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, Greenpeace's very own toxic Mickey Mouse, redubbed
"CheMickey", appeared in Brussels to await his fate. He's been
locked in the stocks and put on trial outside the European Union
Competitiveness Council where EU ministers are meeting to discuss
the proposed reform of Europe's chemicals policy (REACH). Chemickey
will be straddling one barrel containing consumer products known to
contain harmful chemicals, and another containing non-toxic safer
alternatives. The decision on whether CheMickey will be released
from his toxic burden lies in the hands of Industry and Economy
Ministers, represented by the characters of Chirac, Blair and
Schröder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="60054"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on companies by Greenpeace to substitute hazardous
chemicals is already bearing (organic) fruit. Last week, UK
retailer the Co-op announced that it was banning a range of toxic
chemicals still permitted for use in everyday products like
washing-up liquid and household cleaners, as part of a new ethical
drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What you can do right now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/index.cfm"&gt;Take
a tour of the Chemical Home and update your shopping list with
toxic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1366&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;Tell
Disney to stop using toxic chemicals in its childrenswear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Why are we being imitated?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/imitate-our-actions-not-our-w/</url><text>
	They seemed innocent enough. Just little business-card sized pamphlets, small enough to be slipped into the wallet of any delegate, asking one simple question at the preparatory meetings for the Earth Summit in Bali: 'Why are you here?'  We answered our own question with a four-point checklist of action needed to save our world.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/greenfreeze-and-solar-chill-on.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/greenfreeze-and-solar-chill-on.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenfreeze and Solar Chill on display at the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, Setpember 2002.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in Johannesburg, a 'copy-cat' pamphlet has appeared. What
did the cover say? Why, it was titled 'Why is the European Union
here?' It answered its own question with a ten-point checklist of
fluffy green advertising slogans. If imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, why was the European Union imitating
Greenpeace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25858/brochures_lrg.gif" align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example. We have been pushing for the governments of the
world to adopt new renewable energy like wind, solar, small-scale
hydro and modern biomass. We demanded last year that clean,
renewable energy be provided to the two billion of the world's
poorest people who currently live off the energy grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, somebody else decided to copy our message. In
their latest advertising, Shell Oil, a major producer of polluting
fossil fuels, notes two billion of the planet's poorest people have
no energy, and "we need to do more than just talk about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, we don't mind being imitated. But we'd really prefer
that Shell and the European Union imitate our actions, not our
words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're proving the viability of small-scale renewable energy by
investing in prototypes that work, using today's technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're demonstrating that a future based on renewable energy is
environmentally practical and economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're sending signals to government that we can address poverty
AND global warming with the same solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're challenging governments and industries to drive the
investment necessary to make these technologies much cheaper and
much more widely available, through the kind of binding targets
that create an even playing field for market forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the European Union doing? At the moment, it appears that
under the spineless leadership of Denmark, they are about to sell
out on their commitment to firm renewable targets for the world's
energy mix, bowing to pressure from the United States and corporate
puppeteers like Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's Shell doing? Continuing to expand its capacity to produce
and sell the very fossil fuels that are choking Asia under a brown
haze and slowly cooking our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we doing? At the exhibition space formerly set aside to
showcase business interests and government ventures here in
Johannesburg, we secured a place to showcase initiatives such as
the SolarChill project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SolarChill is a refrigerator that stores the sun's energy in
ice, and can be used to keep vaccines and food cool in places where
no electricity is now available. We're also showcasing the solar
Greenfreeze refrigerator, which uses no climate-killing chemicals
and can be powered by wind, hydropower, biogas or grid energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true significance of the SolarChill is related to vaccines.
The availability of vaccine refrigerators in developing countries
is vital for maintaining the shelf life of vaccines and some
medicines, such as the liquid form of antibiotics. Many people live
off the grid or with unstable energy, and keeping medicines cold
can be all but impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine refrigerators that can be powered by a number of energy
sources can alleviate the problem of non-existing or insufficient
electrical supply, and can also be of great benefit under emergency
circumstances, such as natural disasters or war conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janos Maté has been showing off a working SolarChill prototype
to visitors to the Global Forum for the past week. In his view, the
Summit should be announcing investment projects to make technology
like this available to as many rural villages as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I've had many people ask where they could buy a SolarChill, and
it's a shame that this is the only working model. One woman told me
that she lives in a small village here in South Africa, and that
her fridge is kerosene-powered. The kerosene costs a dollar a day,
it needs to refilled each night, and it spits out black smoke."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What our corporate and government imitators forget is that our
real messages are actions, not words. They say clearly that clean
solutions to real everyday situations are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Ubuntu village we have a portable container that acts as a
shopfront. It showcases four small businesses, all run on renewable
energy. Jan Pronk, the Special Envoy to the Earth Summit, opened
the Energy Store by enjoying a freshly squeezed juice from an
electric juicer, before logging onto the internet using a solar
powered computer to sign an online petition, and then giving a
colleague a solar-powered haircut. The petition calls for the
massive uptake of renewable energy by the industrialised nations,
and access to clean renewable energy for two billion of the world's
poorest people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working demonstration at Ubuntu village is a call to the
world's governments to adopt a target of 10 percent of new
renewable energy by 2010. We have said it on our pamphlets, hung it
from banners, painted it on hot air balloons and developed
prototypes that WORK. When will governments and multinationals stop
talking the talk, and start walking the walk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is the lifeblood of modern society. We are at a
crossroads due to the global impact of current polluting energy
supplies such as oil, coal, gas and nuclear power. A clean energy
future is now urgently needed. Renewable energy is reliable,
inexhaustible power generated by natural processes such as wind,
solar, biomass and small-scale hydro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cost of getting renewable energy to the world's
poorest two billion people is estimated to be less than half of the
US$500+ billion that is likely to be invested over the next decade
in fossil fuel power stations and infrastructure in poorer
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For just US$1.4 billion, clean renewable energy could be
supplied to one million schools and health care centres, serving
some 600 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meeting that has been criticised for its obsession with
trade, subsidies and protecting the rights of businesses, the lack
of talk about environmental protection, sustainability or poverty
alleviation is disheartening. But the lack of action is far worse.
We'd love to live in a world where governments and multinationals
behaved more like Greenpeace. But they need to put their money
where their mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;

	As two British nuclear freighters near the Irish Sea with their deadly cargo of weapons-usable plutonium, a flotilla of small sailboats are getting into position to peacefully protest their passage.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/jim-corr-of-irish-pop-group-th.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Jim Corr of Irish pop group the Corrs, takes the helm of a Greenpeace inflatable while lending his support to the Nucelar Free Seas Flottila.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior, is also in the Irish
Sea to support the flotilla. Together they will ensure that the
passage of this deadly and dangerous shipment will get as much
global attention as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish the UK and Japanese governments had enough integrity and
backbone not to put people around the world in danger by shipping
weapons usable-plutonium past their coasts. The huge groundswell of
protest from 80 en-route governments, many thousands of individuals
and seafarers wishing to stop their oceans becoming nuclear
highways, has so far fallen on deaf ears. The upcoming peaceful
protest in the Irish Sea will perhaps be the one that breaks the
silence and elicits the response that we all want; cancel all
further shipments, phase out nuclear power and invest in clean,
safe energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla is to make
sure this shipment does not pass unnoticed - to hopefully raise
enough of a ruckus to make this the last shipment and to get the
Sellafield nuclear plant shut down. As the nuclear ships approach
and the flotilla and the Rainbow Warrior have been readying
themselves for action, there has been an amazing outpouring of
support from the Irish government and people. The Irish navy will
be sending a patrol boat to monitor the shipment, and the Irish
Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, made a surprise visit to the Rainbow
Warrior on Wednesday to express his support and admiration for the
members of the flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipper Cormac Kavanagh explained his motivation for joining the
flotilla, "What else can we do? We would all prefer not to have to
do this, but what would we say to our children if the worst came to
the worst? I just could not say 'I didn't care enough to take
action',"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We owe the people who care enough, like Cormac, to take action,
a huge debt. The nuclear industry has been flying in the face of
global protest against their activities for long enough - it is now
time for us to make them listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us by &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/ship_crew.html"&gt;witnessing
the passage of the nuclear titanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't beg, borrow or steal a boat to join the flotilla

	Norman Askew, chief executive of British Nuclear Fuels has a skewed perspective. He is "delighted" by nuclear power expansion, even as people living around the Sellafield nuclear plant die from unusually high rates of cancer. Askew and government owned British Nuclear Fuels are also violating countries national sovereignty around the world as they ship plutonium through national waters against countries’ permissions. The warrant for their arrest is long overdue.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Norman Askew, Chief Executive of BNFL, is wanted for crimes against the planet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental criminal:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman Askew, Chief Executive of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) is
wanted for questioning over ongoing, massive radioactive discharges
into the global environment, a litany of safety breaches at BNFL's
Sellafield plutonium facility, global transports of weapons-usable
plutonium and failure to deal with a huge stockpile of radioactive
waste. The only problem is that the local authorities are all
answerable to the UK government - the owners of BNFL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman gets rewarded well for the burden of running one of the
world's biggest polluters - he just received an 18 percent pay
raise 'as he had met targets for improving the operating
performance of the company' - try telling that to the people who
live around Sellafield and along the Irish Sea coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The accomplice:&lt;/span&gt; BNFL's
partner in environmental crime is the UK government, represented by
Energy Minister, Brian Wilson. In a recent piece of creative
accountancy, worthy of the likes of Enron or WorldCom, the UK
government recently decided to move £40.5 billion of BNFL's
liabilities to the wonderfully named 'Liabilities Management
Authority'. This is what it will cost to decommission and clean up
the nuclear waste built up from BNFL's past activities - and the
company only has £4bn in the bank to pay for it. Guess who gets to
pay for BNFL's nuclear clean-up...the UK taxpayer of course. The
same taxpayers will also face future harm from the UK's radioactive
heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental crime:&lt;/span&gt;
BNFL is armed with one of the deadliest substances on Earth,
plutonium, which they use to fuel a dirty and dangerous nuclear
energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all began in 1951 when huge quantities of radioactive waste
were deliberately pumped untreated into the Irish Sea to test the
effects it had on the marine ecosystem. The discharges have been
reduced but continue to this day. In spite of an international
agreement calling for a phase-out of the discharges and the
introduction of land-based dry storage of radioactive wastes, the
UK intends to keep discharging radioactivity into the Irish Sea for
at least another generation (2024 and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL is also wanted for gross negligence and incompetence for
falsifying data relating to the manufacture of plutonium MOX
material exported to Japan; failure to meet the schedule to deal
with high level nuclear wastes building up at their Sellafield
plant; and numerous safety violations at Sellafield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL is involved in scandalous political donations. They are
accused of 'greasing the palms' of US political parties to ease
their business dealings in the US amidst opposition. BNFL have held
the UK people ransom by demanding more and more funding in a vain
attempt to manage their ageing nuclear installations and activities
in a safer way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL is also endangering citizens beyond the UK with the
transport of weapons-useable plutonium around the world and back
through sovereign waters against countries' wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their shareholders, the UK government, are also wanted for the
most heinous environmental crime of not only supporting the
continuation of BNFL's nuclear pollution, but for approving the
expansion of nuclear terror. The UK government has given BNFL
permission to expand operations at Sellafield and is currently
considering licensing another 10 nuclear power stations in the UK,
some of which may be built by BNFL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table width="170" border="0" bgcolor="99cc66" cellpadding="4" align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Witness Statement:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'this type of company is not qualified to conduct business in
the nuclear field.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 64%"&gt;-Japanese Electric Utility Industry
Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The victims:&lt;/span&gt; Although
BNFL is putting people around the world at risk with their deadly
plutonium shipments, the real victims are back at home, so close to
the problem it is stealing their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the time of the 1957 fire, Barbara Roberts was ten years
old. Her parents' house was on the southern end of Walney Island.
Like most children she had drunk milk at school and at home before
the ban on the milk came through....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Walney channel is the most contaminated area of the Furness
Peninsula, with levels of plutonium 1800 times fallout having been
recorded there. Not that the Roberts knew this. Like most Barrow
families the Roberts loved the beaches. They were a great place to
take the family for a day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Barbara... used to collect winkles and cockles and continued to
eat shellfish directly from the sea right the way through her five
pregnancies, although only three of the children she conceived made
it into the world. In 1977 she was diagnosed as having a breast
cancer... In 1981 she was found to have secondary cancers in the
brain. She was told the condition was incurable and died on 19
December 1981.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"'She would lie in bed and ask me to push my hands to the side
of her head to ease the pain,' her mother recalls. 'Sometimes I
could hardly bear it... I've seen too much suffering in my life.
This nuclear business... they don't know where it begins or where
it ends. I remember now how daft I was in 1957. We heard the news
to throw the milk away and I did that.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"'I was just about to send Barbara to the shop for some more
when I realised what I was doing. How did she come to die? Was it
the accident, or playing on the beach, or eating the winkles?'
Barbara's father vividly recalls that on cold mornings he would
stop and talk to his daughter as she leant against the spent
nuclear fuel falks for warmth as they were being unloaded in the
dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ian Renwick... died of acute lymphatic leukemia in 1971 at the
age of three. He was first diagnosed at the age of 20 months. Ian's
family live in Moor Row, a small village six miles north of
Sellafield. The family regularly ate local winkles and mussels that
they gathered from the seashore as well as eating locally caught
fish two or three times a week. The family holidays would be spent
on the Cumbrian coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dorothy Reay died in 1962 aged 10 months of a lymphatic
leukemia. Her family lives in Whitehaven, very close to the coast.
She died within four days of the first blood tests being taken. Her
father was a Sellafield worker who died of cancer in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In a village the size of Seascale the expected rate for
lymphomas for all ages would be one every fifteen years. [From 1980
to 1990] there were seven cases reported, giving a rate of nearly
twelve times the national average."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from "Living in the Shadow - the Story of the People of
Sellafield" by Jean McSorley, Pan Books 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The verdict:&lt;/span&gt; Very guilty
indeed. BNFL have mislead both to the public and to their
customers. They have led the public to believe that nuclear power
is safe and clean when it clearly is not. BNFL has left a
radioactive legacy that we are stuck with for millennia to come.
There is no solution other than to ensure that it is stored in
secure, above ground, well-documented facilities - so that our
relatives 30,000 years down the line know what it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But BNFL must be held accountable for the dangerous shipments of
rejected plutonium which, if new contracts are signed with their
Japanese customers, will lead to another 100 such dangerous
shipments over the next ten years. The UK government is responsible
for stopping such madness and putting an end to the expansion of
nuclear power. The government must fund more large-scale renewable
energy projects like the giant offshore wind farm off the coast of
North Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help make BNFL accountable for their environmental
crimes by &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf2&amp;amp;s=vf" target="_blank"&gt;joining the virtual flotilla against BNFL's current
shipment of plutonium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Reward:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clean and safe environment and a clear conscience that we are
leaving future generations a legacy of clean, renewable energy
rather than dangerous energy, radioactive waste and a secure
world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Lee Raymond and Exxon are the Godfathers of corporate environmental crime. They have built up an unfathomable empire at the cost of our environment.

            Exxon's Lee Raymond is WANTED for crimes against the climate. You can download your own wanted poster below.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental criminal:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Raymond, Chairman and Chief Executive of ExxonMobil (Esso),
the world's richest company, is wanted for questioning over his
part in an audacious plot to bake the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is armed with the absurd belief that global warming is not
caused by burning oil, coal or gas. His views are believed by the
scientific community to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The accomplice:&lt;/span&gt; Raymond
often rides out with his partner George W Bush. Together the two of
them are known to be responsible for a number of hold ups, most
notably the United States ditching of the Kyoto protocol on climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental crime:&lt;/span&gt;
Lee Raymond and Exxon are responsible for sabotaging efforts by the
international community to tackle global warming. Through a
ten-year campaign of dirty tricks, Raymond's Exxon has done more
than any other company on the planet to sabotage international
action to tackle global warming. Exxon gave US$1.376 million to the
Republicans in the 2000 election cycle - more than any other oil
company. As soon as George Bush became president, he pulled the
United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, the only international
agreement to address global warming - exactly the policy that Exxon
was promoting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The victims:&lt;/span&gt;The huge
amounts of oil Exxon sells every day help make the world a little
warmer every day. Eventually we will all feel the impacts of
climate change if you haven't already. As the climate changes, so
will our environment. One result of global warming already being
seen is the retreat of glaciers across the globe. View our
investigation into the melting glacier on Mt. Kilimanjaro in
Tanzania in Quicktime format - &lt;a href="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1534/release1.0/www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/22625/0/kiliQTfin1.mov" target="_blank"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1534/release1.0/www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/22628/0/kiliQTfin2.mov" target="_blank"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The verdict:&lt;/span&gt; Guilty.
Exxon is misleading the public, buying off governments and selling
the planet short. It is time for them to clean up their act and
stop meddling in international agreements to prevent climate
change. The US government is duplicitous in this crime. President
Bush has allowed big business to dictate global policy and has yet
to hold Exxon accountable for environmental damage done by
Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;

crimes by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;joining the Stop
Exxon/Esso campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory: Monsanto drops GE Wheat</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-monsanto-drops-ge-whe/</url><text>
	There's a reason to celebrate today: Monsanto has caved at last and given up on further development or open field trials of its genetically engineered "Roundup Ready" wheat. Monsanto won't admit it has bowed to overwhelming market rejection, but that's clearly behind their decision. It's a hard-won victory for every environmental group, every consumer, every  cyberactivist who has said "no" to genetically engineered foods.  The decision fits a pattern of industry retreat set last month by Bayer CropScience's decision to withdraw GE maize from the UK.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/monsanto-announced-that-it-has.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/monsanto-announced-that-it-has.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monsanto announced that it has suspended further development and open field trials of its genetically engineered, Roundup Ready wheat
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a victory for the environment, farmers and consumers,"
said Pat Venditti, our GE campaigner in Canada. "Strong rejection
of GE wheat from virtually every corner of the globe once again
showed the resistance to GE foods."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto announced today that they will defer all further
efforts to introduce Roundup Ready wheat, and that they will
discontinue breeding and field-level research of the crop. This
follows a similar announcement in 2003 when the company announced
its withdrawal from the development of pharmaceutical crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Let's hope GE wheat permanently joins GE flax, GE tomatoes and
GE potatoes in the dustbin of bad ideas. Rather than having to
restage this battle in four years time, we hope that Monsanto has
heard loud and clear that genetically engineered wheat is a
non-starter," continued Mr. Venditti. "The Canadian Government
should make a note of this and re-think its devotion to this
unnecessary technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bread 2.jpg" src="/international/PageFiles/25942/Bread%202.jpg" width="180" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Canadian Wheat Board 87 percent of Canadian
wheat buyers now require non-GE certification of wheat. In a survey
of countries willing to accept GE wheat by the US Department of
Agriculture, only four - Peru, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Yemen - said
they would buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our GE team leader Dan Hindsgaul added: "Last year Monsanto
dropped GE pharmaceutical crops and now they have chosen to write
off huge investments in developing Roundup Ready GE wheat.
Consumers and farmers have long lost confidence in the company that
also gave us pesticides, PCBs, Agent Orange and GE growth hormones
for cattle. It's only a matter of time when Monsanto also lose the
backing they have enjoyed in certain government offices and among
financial analysts."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Nuclear Meltdown</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/nuclear-meltdown/</url><text>
	The lid has finally been blown off the nuclear industrys chamber of secrets. Coverups, bankruptcies and insolvencies, safety lapses and failures in plant security have been on the roll call in the last week alone.  And all this as the most potent symbols of the industry's failure, two nuclear freighters, near the Irish Sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/72-of-the-british-public-say.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/72-of-the-british-public-say.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            72% of the British public say no to nuclear power and yes to wind. Greenpeace projects poll result onto Sizewell nuclear plant in Suffolk, UK
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the highly dangerous and unnecessary shipment of reject
plutonium from Japan to the UK enters European waters, nearing its
eventual destination of Sellafield, the British and Japanese
nuclear industries must be wishing they had never signed the
contract for it to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week British Nuclear Fuel's (BNFL) largest single
reprocessing client, British Energy, declared itself on the verge
of insolvency. Then, news broke that Japan's largest utility, Tokyo
Electric Power Company (TEPCO), has been embroiled in a scandal
around falsification of safety inspections at their reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh for clean, safe energy which many could have had access to by
now. If the huge subsidies gratefully received by the nuclear and
fossil fuel industries had been spent with the health and security
of the planet and its people in mind, the story would be so
different today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent poll, 72 percent of the British public said 'No' to
nuclear and 'Yes' to wind power. The City Assembly of Kashiwazaki
in Japan has just voted against approval for plutonium loading at
the Kashiwazaki-kariwa reactor, it is hoped that other cities and
prefectures follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En-route, the plutonium shipment has already moved the
governments of 80 nations to register strong protests. Some
seafarers have felt so strongly that they have put their lives on
the line by forming a flotilla to protest the shipment's passage
through the Tasman Sea. Many thousands more concerned landlubbing
citizens have joined &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf3&amp;amp;s=vf"&gt;Greenpeace's
virtual flotilla&lt;/a&gt; and have emailed protest letters to the
Japanese and British foreign ministers as well as to South Africa's
President Mbeki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to the nuclear industry's woes, in the next week or so
the reject plutonium shipment will sail into the Irish Sea into
possibly the largest peaceful protest that it has encountered. A
flotilla of sailboats from Ireland and Wales, and Greenpeace's
flagship, Rainbow Warrior II, will be there to ensure that the
plutonium shipment will get the world's attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ireland is the country most affected by the UK's nuclear
industry. Sellafield is only 60 miles away from the Irish coast and
has been pumping 2 million gallons of liquid radioactive waste into
the Irish Sea every day, making the Irish Sea the most radioactive
sea in the world. If an accident happens at the plant or with the
shipment, or if there is a terrorist attack, depending on which way
the wind blows, Dublin, Dundalk, Drogheda, Belfast, and vast parts
of Ireland, would be uninhabitable. No wonder the Irish government
is sending a navy patrol boat and a spotter plane to closely
monitor the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge global groundswell of anger against this
shipment as it is a potent symbol of the unreliable, uneconomic and
dangerous industry which it services. Let us hope that the people
who so easily risk our lives to turn a profit finally see the
light, cancel further shipments and recognise that only clean, safe
energy will do.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Hendrik A. Verfaillie and Monsanto are wanted for crimes of genetic pollution.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental criminal:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto is wanted for questioning in relation to the genetic
pollution of the planet Earth, force feeding global citizens
genetically engineered foods and the global take over of the
planet's food sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is armed with the arrogant belief that genetic engineering is
safe, both for the environment and human health. Monsanto is the
same company that brought us such safe, healthy products as Agent
Orange and PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The accomplice:&lt;/span&gt; The US
and Canadian governments not only ignored the inherent risks of
genetic engineering, they have aided Monsanto setting up an
inadequate regulatory system that relies on risk assessment,
industry science and voluntary compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental crime:&lt;/span&gt;
As if polluting the planet with noxious PCBs, dioxins and harmful
pesticides wasn't enough, now this leader in the genetic
engineering industry is threatening to alter the genes of every
food crop on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's Robert Fraley testified: "What you are seeing is not
just a consolidation of seed companies, it's really a consolidation
of the entire food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a spending spree of billions of US dollars acquiring
seed companies around the world and the contamination of the global
food chain with GE crops, Monsanto's diabolical plan of global food
take over may soon be a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since meeting resistance from people in developed nations,
Monsanto has turned its focus to developing nations. They claim
that they can help meet the world's growing food needs and feed the
hungry. But they ignore the fact that most hungry people live in
countries that have food surpluses rather than deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.farmingsolutions.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Innovative, environmentally responsible farming
practices&lt;/a&gt; are already in the ground, offering food security and
sustainable livelihoods without drawing farmers into more
dependency, threatening biodiversity or endangering human health.
Food security, the ability of a community to feed itself
consistently on a diverse and healthy diet, is a complex problem
that will not be solved overnight, it depends on people having
access to land and money. Monsanto is offering neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why should we believe that this move to sell genetically
engineered crops to developing nations to help them with hunger and
malnutrition comes from the goodness of their hearts. If their
relationship with farmers in developed nations is any indication,
farmers in the developing world will be trampled by the coercion
and censorship tactics of this agriculture bully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto promotes a farming model of snooping and snitching on
your neighbours. The company employs a small army of private
investigators to check up on farmers and advertises a toll-free
informer line. They have tried to censor journalists questioning
the safety of Monsanto's bovine growth hormone and stop the
printers of the Ecologist from publishing a special edition
attacking Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead Monsanto spends millions on public relations campaigns
of misinformation and warm fuzzy feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The victim:&lt;/span&gt; Percy
Schmeiser is a farmer from the prairie food belt of Canada. His
canola fields were contaminated with Monsanto's Round-Up Ready
canola seed. Monsanto's position is that it doesn't matter whether
Percy knew it or not, his canola field was contaminated with the
Roundup Ready gene and he must pay their technology fee. Percy and
his wife Louise stood up to Monsanto in a classic battle of good
versus evil, David versus Goliath, but in this round it was
Monsanto that won out in the Canadian court battle. Percy is
appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto quotes Gandhi "we must be the change we wish to see in
the world" in their propaganda. But it was Percy who received the
Mahatma Gandhi Award while he was in India in October 2000. The
award is given in recognition of working for the betterment and
good of humankind in a non-violent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.percyschmeiser.com/gp-percy2.mp3"&gt;Listen to
Percy's story&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The verdict:&lt;/span&gt; Oh so
guilty, their arrest is overdue. Monsanto has already polluted
every corner of the planet with PCBs and dioxin, they must be held
accountable before all crops and genetic resources on the planet
are contaminated and our food supply forever under their
control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Canadian governments must hold Monsanto accountable
for their crimes against the environment and the global food
supply. World governments need to agree on legally binding rules
for corporations that hold them responsible for the actions next
week at the Earth Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The Reward:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safe and secure global food supply, a healthy environment and
the chance to properly tackle the inadequate distribution of food
to the world's hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

	Michael D. Parker and Dow Chemical Company are corporate scoundrels of the worst kind. They were forced to clean up a toxic mess at home in the US, but won't clean up one of the deadliest chemical spills on the planet in Bhopal, India. Someone is getting away with murder. Governments must agree on legally binding rules at the Earth Summit next week to ensure sustainable development and hold corporations accountable for their actions.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Michael D.  Paker, CEO of Dow Chemical Company, is wanted for crimes against the planet. You can get your own Dow WANTED poster below.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental criminal:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael D. Parker, head of Dow chemicals, the world's largest chemical company is wanted for questioning about how a immensely wealthy US multinational refuses to help the survivors of the world's worst industrial disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His company constantly denies any responsibility for the suffering of 120,000 residents of Bhopal, who remain chronically ill, despite purchasing Union Carbide, owners of the plant at the time of the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The environmental crime:&lt;/span&gt; On the night of December 2nd 1984, over 40 tonnes of lethal gas spilled out from Union Carbide's pesticide factory in Bhopal,India. With safety systems either malfunctioning or turned off, a huge area of the city was enveloped in lethal gas. People woke in their homes to fits of coughing, their lungs filling with fluid. In the span of the first three days after the accident, over 8,000 people died in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the disaster, over 20,000 people have died from exposure-related illnesses, and of the approximately 520,000 people exposed to the poisonous gases, an estimated 120,000 remain chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice has eluded the people of Bhopal for over 17 years. Union Carbide negotiated a settlement with the Indian government in 1989 for US$470 million, which amounts to a paltry total of US$370 to US$533 per survivor, which does not cover medical bills for most of the survivors. Imagine having your life ruined by an avoidable industrial disaster and being paid only US$400 compensation by a huge chemical multinational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its merger with Union Carbide, Dow has refused to assume these liabilities in India despite the fact that over 20,000 people in vicinity of the Union Carbide factory continue to be exposed to toxic pollution from the abandoned chemical plant. Dow proudly proclaims "Living. Improved daily." in its propaganda of chemical propagation. However in Bhopal it is a case of "Life. Poisoned daily."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The victims:&lt;/span&gt; The people of Bhopal have been suffering since the day of the disaster. You can view the shocking images of the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/multimedia/slideshows/bhopal-the-world-s-worst-ind/"&gt; immediate aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, the suffering in the  years that followed and see what  people are doing today to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The verdict:&lt;/span&gt; Guilty. Dow claims " protecting people and the environment is part of everything we do and every decision we make." In reality it seems that because the disaster happened in India the company thinks it can get away without cleaning up the mess and properly compensating survivors. Dow claims to be " in discussions" with Bhopal activists. After almost 18 years what the people of Bhopal really need is action not mere words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help make Dow take responsible for their environmental crimes, write to Dow and tell them to clean up their act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Reward: &lt;/span&gt;Showing the chemical industry that it cannot hide its pollution in the developing world. A life poisoned daily is worth the same whether it is in the US or India.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Exposure: Portrait of a Corporate Crime</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bhopal-an-ongoing-corporate/</url><text>
	This moving exhibition offers a unique photographic insight into the human and environmental tragedy that has engulfed the Indian city of Bhopal since December 1984, when an explosion at Union Carbide's pesticide plant released lethal gases into the city, causing the world's worst industrial disaster.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/skulls-discarded-after-researc.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/skulls-discarded-after-researc.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Skulls discarded after research at the Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal. Medical experts believe that the gas inhaled by the people of Bhopal may have affected the brain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Carbide responded by abandoning the contaminated plant, paying the survivors inadequate compensation and refusing to accept liability for the disaster. The exhibition documents both the immediate aftermath of the explosion and the ongoing struggle of survivors determined to secure justice from the chemical giant even though they have lost their families, economic security and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moving collection shows what happens when companies such as Union Carbide - now merged into Dow - are not held accountable for the disasters and pollution they cause. It gives a voice to the people whose lives have been torn apart by a corporate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world renowned photographer, Raghu Rai, arrived in Bhopal hours after the gas leak to find chaos as the dead were being buried and cremated and the hospitals overflowing with thousands of patients. Rai realised he was witnessing a disaster of unprecedented proportions and the start of a long nightmare for the gas exposed survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What I saw was to change my life. It was an unprecedented scene of chaos. What startled me most was the silence of death. Thousands of people had already died, thousands more than died in the 11 September attack on the World Trade Centre. I vowed then and there to continue my work, to do all I could to show the world what happens to people when corporations are not held liable for their operations, when they are allowed to cut costs and safety standards when they operate abroad.' said Raghu Rai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 20,000 have died from gas exposure and the effects are now extending into the next generation. 150,000 of the survivors are chronically ill and communities are drinking contaminated groundwater because Dow has still not cleaned up the dangerous chemicals Union Carbide left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara Bai, a Bhopal survivor who went on hunger strike for 19 days in July to protest the move by the Indian government to reduce charges against former Union Carbide boss Warren Anderson said: "I remember the night of the gas leak as though it were yesterday. I lost my child and could not conceive since. To see the culprits of this disaster being let off by a shameless government is too much to bear. They seem to treat the world's worst industrial disaster as though it had been a car crash."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow claims "protecting people and the environment is part of everything we do and every decision we make." In reality it seems that because the disaster happened in India the company thinks it can get away without cleaning up the mess and properly compensating survivors. Dow claims to be "in discussions" with Bhopal activists. After almost 18 years, what this exhibition clearly shows, is that the people of Bhopal really need action not mere words.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace and Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands in the Tasman Sea wait for the two armed nuclear freighters The Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal to deliver their protest message.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three year old JJ is already a seasoned sailor but this weekend
is going to be special even for the youngest crew member of the
"Love of Gaia", a 16.3 metre yacht from Australia. Together with 11
other boats, and more than 35 crew from as close as New Zealand and
Vanuatu and as far away as Poland and the UK, JJ is waiting
mid-Tasman Sea for his chance to protest against a shipment of
dangerous nuclear transport through the Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical day on Love of Gaia starts with an organic espresso
for those on the 6 am watch, followed by soggy Weetabix for JJ.
Every morning there has been a regular radio link up with the other
flotilla boats and now they are all in one spot, the chance to meet
face to face with their fellow sailors. JJ's dad, Skipper Inigo
Wijnen is no stranger to adventure - in 1993 he sailed
single-handedly from the Netherlands to Australia in a Proa
catamaran. Inigo heard about the Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla on the
grapevine and was intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The world's nuclear industry is running like a car without
brakes. It makes me scared for my children that this madness goes
on unchecked and our kids will have to live with the consequences
when the crash finally happens."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across on Nanu, a boat from New Zealand, nine year old Sylvain
and sister Sophia are having to watch videos upside down - at first
the crew thought they had bad quality tapes but they are just
extremely sensitive to waves. On the way to the Tasman, dolphins
visited Nanu twice, Fio-Oko spied sperm whales; both boats had an
escort of Storm Petrels, Albatross and other seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanu had already set one rule for the flotilla participants --
any boat arriving at the rendezvous point late has to come up with
a bottle of rum for every 12 hours they are late! But there is
little chance of too many drunken sailors -- all the boats are now
in position after great support from communities in the nearby
islands of Norfolk and Lord Howe. Tiama, a yacht from New Zealand,
was given a big bag of fresh island fruit as a send-off by locals,
while local people on Lord Howe joined a small demonstration on the
island to support the flotilla earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla's protest at the plutonium shipment is not alone.
In the last few days, several Pacific Island nations have reacted
with outrage after the "Pacific Pintail" and her dangerous cargo
breached their 200 mile maritime zones. The Pintail passed just 40
nautical miles (72 kilometres) from Pohnpei, the capital of the
Federated States of Micronesia, in spite of the country's explicit
demand that the ship stay outside its waters. Vanuatu has said it
is "livid" over the shipment passing through its zone, and said it
was disrespectful of the sovereignty and dignity of Vanuatu and its
long support for a nuclear free Pacific. Meanwhile, the New Zealand
Foreign Minister, Mr Phil Goff has strongly reiterated his
country's opposition to the shipment through the Pacific and is
putting up Orion aircraft to track the "Pintail" to ensure it does
not enter New Zealand's 200 mile zone. The Cook Islands Government
has supported calls for the region to ban plutonium shipments
through the Pacific. And Fiji's Prime Minister was loudly applauded
earlier this week when he told a summit of Western and African,
Caribbean and Pacific leaders that all the South Pacific countries
opposed the passage of nuclear ships through the Pacific and called
for other states to join the Pacific in "expressing our outrage and
opposition to those who are so willing to put the Pacific and our
peoples at risk".&lt;/p&gt;

	If you could join the Greenpeace time ship and travel back 100 years, what would you see? You would be lucky to see one of the early cars, you would likely see mountains of coal and the beginnings of our fossil fuel dependence. And if you could travel deep within the Arctic circle you would see snow and ice which today is only a distant memory in fading photographs.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist Erika Augustinsson comparing a photo of Blomstrandbreen (1928) with the present situation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all do it. We return to a spot from our childhood or youth,
stand itthat same spot and marvel at how the world has changed.
Sometimes thechanges are subtle, even unnoticeable, other times, we
are appalled andalarmed by how the world has changed around us,
seemingly overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you could visit one of the most remote areas of
theplanet a hundred years later and see how it has changed? How
activitiesthat take place far from sight have a lasting impact on
ourenvironment. Would the changes be so subtle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in the far reaches of the Arctic circle, the changes
areobvious. Almost a hundred years later, standing where
researchers fromthe Norwegian Polar Institute took photos
documenting glaciers on theisland Svalbard, we can see that there
have been remarkable changes,and not for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25865/man.jpg" alt="1922 image of man looking at Blomstrandbreen glacier courtesy the Norwegian Polar Institute, 2002 image of Greenpeace activist looking at same glacier copyright Greenpeace and Alsand." align="left" height="380" width="270"&gt;Theisland is more than 600
kilometres from the northern coast of Norway.The name Svalbard
means "the land with the cold coasts" and about twothirds of the
landmass is covered in glaciers. It is a sad irony thattemperature
increases due to climate change means that the glaciers ofSvalbard
are retreating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take specialised scientific instruments or even a
longmeasuring tape to know that the landscape has changed
dramatically onSvalbard over the last hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glaciers in the Kongsfjorden area, where we documented
thelandscape during our voyage, began an almost continuous retreat
around1900. Blomstrandbreen has retreated around two kilometres in
the last80 years. Since 1960, the average retreat of the glacier
has been about35 metres per year, and even higher in the last
decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/earthsummit/images/glaciers/boat.jpg" alt="1918 image of man in a boat in front of Blomstrandbreen glacier courtesy the Norwegian Polar Institute, 2002 image of Greenpeace boat in front of same glacier copyright Greenpeace and Alsand." align="left" height="380" width="270"&gt;Theresults of our research
came as no great surprise. Glaciers in thisspectacular Arctic
region are showing an overall retreat because ofhigher
temperatures. And it fits the pattern of mountain glaciersaround
the world. Glaciers are on the wane and we risk losing
themaltogether if we don't massively reduce greenhouse
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glacier retreats are one of the most visible and reliable signs
thatwarming and climate change is real - not just figures in a
scientificreport. In this way, they are also important indicators
of globalclimate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blame can be put squarely on human activity. Our addiction
tofossil fuels releases millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into
theatmosphere, and this is what is causing temperatures to rise,
and ourfuture to melt before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are more than just magnificent landscapes of ice and
snow.Around the world glaciers provide water for millions of
people, animalsand plants. Increased temperatures brought about by
greenhousepolluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, are destroying
glaciers. Unlesswe break our addiction to fossil fuels, we risk the
wholesaledestruction of glaciers, which would have a huge impact on
billions oflives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a global problem - not only do we risk losing
theworld's glaciers, but we face many other impacts such as
increasedfloods, droughts and storms, loss of coral reefs, sea
level rise andrapid spread of vector borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World leaders are slow to take up the warning so we have come to
theends of the Earth, literally, to remind governments of what is
at stakeif they do not take action at this month's Earth Summit
inJohannesburg. Climate change is hurting the whole world, not just
theArctic, and clean renewable energy is a crucial. They must get
it rightnow, or there will be many places we won't be able to stand
and ponderthe past.&lt;/p&gt;

	Everyone knows it's illegal to import pirated CDs and DVDs, with heavy penalties if you get caught, but what happens when you import stolen timber from the world's last ancient forests? Absolutely nothing.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists dump over a tonne of plywood secured with large chains blocking the entrance to DEFRA, the UK Government's department responsible for the environment. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon lost an area roughly the size of Belgium last year,
and theParadise Forests of South East Asia are disappearing so
rapidly, thattheir most famous residents, orang-utans, are facing
extinction in thewild within the next decade. The African Forests
of the Great Apes issimilarly facing a huge assault. Why? Illegal
and destructive logging,driven by demand for cheap wood from
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, in the port city of Livorno, Italy, we &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/action-on-illegal-logging-ital/"&gt;
blocked&lt;/a&gt; the unloadingof the freighter '&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/simillegalcameroon.pdf"&gt;
Guan He Kou&lt;/a&gt;' which was carrying timber from a companyinvolved
in illegal logging in the Congo Basin. The presence of the'Guan He
Kou' and its rainforest cargo in Europe shows just how easy itis to
steal from some of the most biologically rich areas in the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activists were arrested, the ship continued to deliver
thetimber before sailing to Spain, where we greeted it again in the
portof Valencia on Monday. No inspections, no seizure of the stolen
goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies that log the tropical timber are known to
beinvolved in criminal activities. In Papua New Guinea, for
example, thelogging industry is dominated by Malaysian logging
giant &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/RH_Forest_Report.pdf"&gt;
RimbunanHijau&lt;/a&gt;, a company that has been directly linked not only
toenvironmental destruction, but also to human rights abuses
includingtorture and rape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in the UK, activists &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/criminal-rainforest-timber-tra/"&gt;
blockaded&lt;/a&gt; the offices of the environmentdepartment in protest
at the lack of action to prohibit the importationof illegal
timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="223231" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments around the world have known about thisproblem for
years and they've done absolutely nothing about it.Illegally logged
timber products from the world's last rainforests aresold openly
around the world. This criminal trade must be
prohibitedimmediately," said Phil Aikman, Greenpeace International
forestscampaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's (EC) response to the issue of illegal
logginghas so far been weak. It is promoting voluntary measures,
despite callsfrom 180 NGOs, the European Parliament and 70
companies (including Ikeaand B&amp;amp;Q), who have all called for
legislation which stops theimport of illegally sourced timber
products into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This voluntary approach is an inadequate and untenable position,
notjust for consumers in Europe who are unknowingly complicit in
forestcrimes, but also for the people of timber-producing
countries. TheWorld Bank estimates that illegal logging costs
timber-producingcountries between US$10 and15 billion a year in
lost revenue. Forestdwelling people in countries like Cameroon,
Papua New Guinea and Brazilcannot afford to have their livelihoods
stolen from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps in protecting the ancient forest is the
introduction of laws prohibiting the import of illegal timber.While
the European Commission drags its feet, the forests continue tobe
destroyed and the people that depend on them for their way of
lifecontinue to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Hurricane Wilma breaks records</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hurricanewilmaglobalwarming111/</url><text>
	After Katrina, Rita, and Stan, Hurricane Wilma has left another trail of devastation through the Caribbean, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Western Cuba and Florida.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Man braves flood waters in his destroyed village during the aftermath of Hurricane Stan. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands left homeless by extensive flooding in Mexico.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico and Florida were hardest hit by Wilma. Mexico has just
suffered extensiveflooding, landslides and loss of life due to
Hurricane Stan. OnWednesday 19 Oct, Wilma was measured as the
strongest hurricane everyrecorded. The 2005 North Atlantic
hurricane season has been one of themost intense since records
began in 1851. Only 1969 had as manyhurricanes as this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Out of names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the body responsible for naming hurricanes will have
tostart with the Greek alphabet if there is a new hurricane this
season,having run out of suitable letters in the alphabet to name
hurricanesin 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unparalleled destruction due to hurricanes and the Amazon
Rainforestsuffering &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/slideshows/amazondroughtbrazil"&gt;
severe drought&lt;/a&gt; might be providing a little peek into ourfuture
shaped by global warming. A warmer world will experience manymore
extreme weather events like droughts, storms and floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change,hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming more intense
and moredamaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of
globalwarming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans
startedheating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by
whilehurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet, gather
strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hurricanes and droughts hit the headlines and thousands of
peoplelose their lives there is strangely little news about the
urgentinternational action required to tackle global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global gamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could wait with our fingers crossed, hoping the worst of
thepredictions don't come true, although with every passing week,
eventsand the evidence stack up to suggest it's the worst possible
option forthe planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions are here - clean renewable energy and energy
efficiencymeasures can be implemented now and this must be better
than taking agamble with the planet - as the last few weeks have
shown we wouldcertainly lose that gamble, big time.&lt;/p&gt;

	Matti Wuori, founder of Greenpeace Finland and former Board Chair of Greenpeace International from 1991 - 1993, died aged 60 in Helsinki on October 16th.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Matti Wuori, founder of Greenpeace Finland and the former Board Chair of Greenpeace International from 1991 - 1993. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matti was a Renaissance man who could read 13 languages and was
asarticulate about art, literature, and music as he was outspoken
abouthuman rights and environmentalism.  He believed passionately
inthe importance of non-governmental organisations (NGO's) as a
foil tocorporations and governments in civil society, and he served
as anadviser or board member to more than a dozen of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti Wuori was a strong, visionary voice within civil society
groupsin Europe. He worked tirelessly to protect the environment
and humanrights, as well as strengthen the position of
non-governmentalorganisations in society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wuori was a 'global citizen' in the true meaning of the word.
He didnot hesitate to criticise polluting governments and companies
whoviolate legal and ethical environmental guidelines" said
ExecutiveDirector, Lennart Daleus at Greenpeace Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti's work at Greenpeace was not complete. This autumn he was
set tolead a fact-finding mission on the violation of international
law inlogging operations in the indigenous Sámi homeland in
Northern Finland.Wuori was committed to represent the Sámi reindeer
herders at theEuropean Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I remember well how Matti reminded NGO activists in Brussels
that thecore business of any NGO should be to pose nasty questions
todecision-makers. Matti wanted non-governmental organisations to
work aswatch dogs and alarm clocks in society. He often reminded us
about thedangers of becoming marionettes for governments or
companies. Wepromise to live up to his expectations and carry on
his impressivework" said Campaign Director, Mads Christensen at
Greenpeace Nordic inHelsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti was chairman of Greenpeace International from 1991 to
1993. Anincredibly talented environmental and human rights
campaigner, Mattiplayed a series of very significant roles here at
Greenpeace. Hisenergy and commitment will be greatly missed" said
Jeanne Moffat, BoardMember of Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti  was also a board member of Greenpeace in the Czech
republicand Hungary until his death. In addition to his work
atGreenpeace,  Matti was a prominent Finnish lawyer and
formerMember of the EuropeanParliament. He also worked as an
adviser to the South African Truth andReconciliation Commission
from 1996 until 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rich and varied lifetime, Matti was called upon to
giveexpert testimony in spotting fraudulent artwork, acted in a
featurefilm (in which he played, not surprisingly, a Finnish
lawyer), servedon the board of the Avanti! chamber orchestra, wrote
two books andlectured on human rights, democracy, and
constitutional law. He wasalso known to dance an inimitable
jitterbug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti succumbed to a long battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He was that rarest of combinations: a scholar and an
activist. He'd looked human civilization hard in the eye, saw it
for what it was,and set about the task of redressing its ills,
while never losing sightof its beauty," said Greenpeace
International Board Chair Anne Summers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Thousands of victims have been left homeless by Hurricane Stan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm brought five days of destruction upon Mexico,
Guatamala, andEl Salvador, affecting millions of people.  As
Alejandro Cavillo,Executive Director of our Mexican office notes,
there are communitiesin the mountains and along the coast that are
still cut off from accessor even communications, and the death toll
is certain to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican president, Vicente Fox, has vowed to channel
ballooningprofits from Mexico's oil exports to relief work.  Given
that oiluse is one of the chief contributors to global warming and
with it anincrease in the incidence and severity of extreme weather
events, theirony of this should be lost on nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be funny, if it weren't tragic.   While no
singleweather event  can be blamed on climate change, the overall
trendis toward more weather-related destruction as the Earth
warms. And as with so many natural and unnatural disasters, it's
the poorwho suffer first and most from global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campesinos who rely on natural weather cycles and have
noirrigation sufferthe impacts of drought and seasonal shifts more
than industrialfarmers. Communities in the Amazon which rely on
shallow rivers forfood and medical supplies face mortal perils when
those riversdisappear.  Poor people living in low-lying areas are
hit harderbyflooding than the wealthy who have the means to flee,
and places to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hundreds of thousands of people in Central America dig their
way outof mud slides and struggle with medical and emergency
infrastructuresthat are inadequate, the oil industry rakes in
massive profits, theenergy consumption in the United States and
Europe continues toskyrocket, and the rich keep getting richer
while the poor lose theirhomes, lives,  and livelihoods to the
increasing storms, floods, and droughts ofa world which keeps
getting warmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless we dedicate long term relief aid to our world's climate,
thedeadly spiral will only worsen.  As we rebuild towns and
cities,we should truly rebuild in a way that eases our planet's
carbonburden.  We should ensure renewable energy replaces fossil
fueland nuclear power plants.  We should build
energy-efficienthousing. We should invest in public transportation.
We should ensurethat wetlands and forests and other natural buffers
againstdestruction  are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only upside to total destruction is that it provides
theopportunity for a new start. The energy revolution that the
worldreally needs ought to begin in those places that have seen the
firstglimpses of the greater destruction which will come of our
world's oiladdiction, unless we act now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the victims of Hurricane Stan, our heartfelt sympathies for
all yourlosses.  And to the oil industry and those who continue to
poisonour planet while turning a blind eye to global warming and
its effects,our promise: a day of reckoning is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the energy revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/signup"&gt;Be a part of the solution -- become a Greenpeace cyberactivist and get free action alerts with ways you can help create a green and peaceful future for our planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ways to help the victims (en español)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-mexico/news/apoyemos-a-quienes-lo-han-perd"&gt;Our Mexican office is gathering relief materials and lists ways you can help with relief efforts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/solarchillrefrigeration" title="Solarchill430"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/Solarchill.jpg" align="center" alt="Solarchill430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Activists intercept the MV Ikan Altamira carrying 40,000 tonnes of US GMO contaminated maize/corn.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue at question is the European Union's (EU) de facto
moratorium ongenetically modified organisms (GMOs), as well as a
number of EU memberstates' national bans on GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In poll after poll, Europeanshave stated they don't want to eat
genetically contaminated foods, theydon't want them grown here, and
they don't want them fed to the animalsthat produce their eggs,
milk, and meat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even an ex-executive of the biotech giant Monsanto believes the
dangers of GMOs are being ignored in the rush topush GMOs onto
consumers. We recently released details ofmassive GMO contamination
of the Romanian environment that the Romaniangovernment didn't even
know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Dima, ex-general manager of Monsanto Romania said, "I left
thecompany because I expressed my concerns regarding the
introduction ofGM technology in Romania. I believed that neither
Romania nor thecompany were ready and able to monitor and control
the GM technology".&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To the US and its allies,this is simply a trade dispute. But at
base it's a more fundamentalissue of who makes the rules - the
people of Europe or the unelectedWTO and the corporate empire that
runs it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We're aiming to have a one million signature petition byMay 2006
on the single issue of whether to ban the importation of GMOanimal
feed into Europe. So far, we've gotten 320,000 and rising fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the WTO and the three complaintants are so confident that
they havethe right to determine what food gets put on the dinner
tables ofEurope, we want to know where your petition is?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where's theevidence that Europeans want GMOs? What makes you
think that people whowouldn't feed GMOs to pigs want to have them
force-fed to theirchildren?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When democracy and the will of the people is considered
expendable, Free Trade isn't free: it's corporate tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

	When you live off the land any change in climate can have profound effects. This Tibetan woman used to have a healthy herd of animals to support her family. Now due to the lack of rain and spreading deserts on the Tibetan plateau her income has disappeared. Try telling her that global warming isn't a reality.

            A 31-year-old Tibetan woman at her home in Yellow River township. Once she lived well from the profits off her animals. Now, due to climate change, she is reduced to a life of poverty. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as the roof of the
world, landof high peaks, glaciers and nomadic tribal peoples. The
snowy peaks andglaciers are the source of many of Asia's mightiest
rivers - theGanges, Mekong and China's Yellow River. This area is
predicted to warmconsiderably before 2100 due to global warming.
The roof of the worldis melting, and melting fast.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;A little less ice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what's the big deal about a little less ice in a place full
of thestuff anyway? Actually it's a disaster for the region now, 
and theramifications may yet be felt across the globe. We visited
the region tohighlight the impacts of the changing climate of the
Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the area warms less rain is falling and glaciers in the
region aremelting. Local communities used to make a living of their
herds ofanimals grazing on lush mountain pastures. Now those
pastures are fastturning to desert due to lack of water,
overgrazing and erosion causedby new animals that are thriving in
the warmer conditions. Many localpeople now survive solely on
government handouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/globalwarmingyellowrivermaduo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Onour expedition to the region we travelled on "dancing roads"
distortedby melting permafrost to meet the governor of Madoi
County. In 1980, Madoi wasChina's richest province due to its
agricultural wealth. It is  now China'spoorest. We interviewed
once-prosperous, but now destitute,farmers and saw first hand the
desert gobbling up pasture land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is causing a cocktail of environmental effects at
theYellow River source that threaten an ecological breakdown. When
you seethe empty wells, bridges over nothing but dry dirt, cracked
groundwhere there should be lakes, bare rock and sand where it was
oncehealthy grassland you know something is seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/10/yellow-river-site.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See more impacts in the region at our Yellow River site in &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://www.yellowriversource.org/cn.html"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the immediate impacts on the area are bad enough they
palecompared to the possible future impacts in the rest of China.
TheYellow River has fed China's people since time immemorial.
Today, 120million Chinese people, a tenth of China's population,
rely on theriver, especially for irrigating crops. As well as being
known asChina's 'mother river', is also dubbed the 'cradle of the
Chinesecivilization'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell"&gt;
&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Nowthe mother river is drying up at its source. In many places
onthe upper stretches the flow is much reduced. If the flow of the
rivercontinues to decline it threatens the food supplies for a
large part ofChina's population.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;Alarm bell for the world&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butthis isn't just a problem for China. Many of Asia's rivers
begin on theTibetan Plateau. If it continues to dry this could
affect many ofthese rivers and the millions of people who rely on
them. As well as water shortages, scientistspredict that rising
temperatures will reduce the rice crops that arethe staple food for
more than half of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How would the world feed millions of people who cannot rely on locally produced rice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Yellow River source region is an urgent warning that climate
changeis harming people now and is going to get worse. The Yellow
River storyis not just about China, it's a warning signal that we
need  worldwideaction on global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action on global warming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;Even if you never see the Yellow River you can do something about global warming with these steps for individual action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_127"&gt;Support our fight against global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nobel Peace Prize, founded on a fortune made from explosives, has gone to the agency whose job it is to promote nuclear power without promoting nuclear weapons, and the man who heads it. Anybody with that job probably deserves some kind of prize.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Littering the planet with nuclear power plants won't put a lid on nuclear weapons.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed ElBaradei is the head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency(IAEA), both winners of this year's Nobel Peace
Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency is tasked with policing the spread of nuclearweapons
at the same time it is charged with promoting the verytechnologies
and materials used to make nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a job worthy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In opposing the Iraq war and championing a nuclear-free Middle
East,ElBaradei has in recent years been a voice of sanity in the
world ofnuclear non-proliferation. Here's what he had to say
aboutnuclear weapons in The Economist in October 2003:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. I worry about nuclear
weapons falling intothe hands of terrorists or ruthless dictators.
I worry about nuclearweapons already in the arsenals of democracies
- because as long asthese weapons exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft,
sabotage or accidental launch,and even democracies are not immune
to radical shifts in their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.
I worry, but I also hope. Ihope that a side-effect of globalisation
will be an enduringrealisation that there is only one human race,
to which we allbelong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoken like a Peace Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Mr. Hyde side of his job is to be the UN's front man for
thenuclear industry, peddling more nuclear power to more countries.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, Mr. ElBaradei, is the part of your job that worries us. 
You see, we worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. We worry about nuclear
materialsfalling into the hands of terrorists or ruthless
dictators. We worryabout nuclear materials that are already in
nuclear power plants andreprocessing plants and storage facilities.
Because as long asthese materials exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft or
sabotage, and evendemocracies are not immune to radical shifts in
their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this award will spark a new discussion around
thefundamental contradiction of the International Atomic Energy
Agency'sdual role as nuclear policeman and nuclear salesman. Only
once thatduality is removed can the IAEA truly focus on the
pressing threat ofthe global spread of nuclear weapons technology,
both civil andmilitary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/motorolabreakstoxicspromise230606/"&gt;Update 22 May 2006&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; US mobile phone company Motorola has backtracked on a promise to removetoxic chemicals from its products. While competitors like Sony Ericssonand Nokia are living up to their commitments to remove toxic chemicals,Motorola is not answering the call to clean up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are chemicals in products important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many chemicals found in everyday products are now common
environmentalpollutants and are found in animals and humans. Almost
everyone hasdozens of man-made chemicals in their body; the effects
of thesechemical cocktails on our health are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these voluntary company measures are good news, other
companieswill never change unless the law forces them to. Only then
will thesetoxic chemicals be fully phased out and substituted with
saferalternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about those laws?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current regulation of chemicals is weak and inadequate. Toxic
chemicalsare found from the Arctic to the Alps. The European Union
(EU) isdrafting new chemical law that would set a world standard,
but to beeffective the new law must identify all hazardous
chemicals and requiretheir substitution with safer
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical contamination? No Thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While better chemical regulation should be welcomed by all, it
is underattack from predictable quarters. The chemical industry has
beenscare-mongering with exaggerated claims of job losses and
decliningprofits.It has also recruited dirty industry's best
friend, the BushAdministration, to threaten the EU with a World
Trade Organisationlawsuit if it dares to try and cut toxic
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to counter inaccurate industry lobbying is to have
othercompanies demonstrate that they can do without toxic
chemicals. It remains to beseen if European members of parliament
will side with the people andprogressive companies by voting for
strong chemical law. Or will theyprefer the lobbying and
scare-mongering of dirty industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take a stand for safer chemicals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org/"&gt;We need your voice for safer chemicals to show politicians the need to put the public before dirty industry profits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=167_101"&gt;Help our work for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Almost six months ago we revealed that the European Commission's new headquarters were being renovated with suspected illegal Indonesian wood. Embarrassed, it promised a full enquiry, but has yet to conclude any investigation, clean up its buying policy, or ... do anything much at all. Today the headquarters open.  Did they really think we'd let them get away with this?

        &lt;p&gt;
            The European Commission's practices are destroying the homes of orang-utans such as these.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;"Safeguards are in place to ensure
that buildings procured by the Commission do not contain timbers
from illegal sources...such as the renovation of the
Berlaymont...it makes an explicit requirement ...procure timber
only from sustainable sources"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the words of Neil Kinnock, Vice President of the EU
Commission, in June 2004. If we were to believe him, it would
indeed be strange that just days after the &lt;a href="/international_en/news/details?item_id=473901&amp;amp;campaign_id=3938"&gt;
initial revelation&lt;/a&gt;, our activists observed yet more plywood
being delivered to the Berlaymont construction site from the very
same suspect Indonesian supplies. And in October 2004 Mr Kinnock
seemed to have a bit of a memory lapse about his "explicit
requirement" for sustainable sources. He said: "...the Commission
is not, at present, in a position to state unequivocally whether
any illegally logged wood has been used or not been used in any

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The 13th Floor - unlucky for some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

sorry Mr Kinnock, but we can unequivocally state where your wood
comes from. Photographs taken inside the building show the suspect
wood being used in flooring and walls, including on the 13th floor,
which is devoted to Commissioners' offices including the EU
President's office. It seems that 13 certainly is an unlucky number
for the poor orang-utans whose homes have ended up as Mr Barroso's
floorboards. This suspect timber is supplied by Indonesian logging
companies who buy wood illegally from deforested areas which are
home to threatened species such as the orang-utan and Sumatran
tiger, both predicted to become extinct within a generation if
illegal logging continues. Up to 90 percent of logging in Indonesia
is illegal.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" title="Inside the Berlaymont building" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="68472"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ancient forests of Indonesia deserve better than to end up
buried under the floor of the European Union headquarters," said
Forest Campaigner Gavin Edwards. "Incoming EU Commission President
Barroso will literally be walking all over the home of orang-utans
and Sumatran tigers, at a time when they should be stopping illegal
timber imports into Europe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sweeping the problems under the carpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" title="The original Berlaymont action" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59688"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;a href="/international_en/news/details?item_id=473901&amp;amp;campaign_id=3938" target="_blank"&gt;Last time around&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 4000 people from
around the world sent letters to the EU Commissioner for the
Environment, Margot Wallström, asking her to make sure this didn't
happen again. Her response: absolutely nothing. (But don't worry,
we'll give you something to do soon that she can't ignore...)
Despite the European Commission's supposed commitment to showing
leadership in protecting the world's forests, they are completely
failing, to the extent that highly suspicious floorboards lie under
the plush carpets in their own buildings. Talk about being right
under their nose! It is sadly ironic that as they celebrate the
opening of their comfy new offices in Belgium, an area of ancient
forest the size of that very country is disappearing worldwide
every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Please, no more monkey business!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table bgcolor="D3D6D3" vspace="10" hspace="10" width="200" align="right" border="0"&gt;

&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"EU Commission President Barroso will
literally be walking all over the home of Orang-utans and Sumatran
tigers" - Forest Campaigner Gavin Edwards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The Commission has yet to reform its own purchasing and contracting
policy to prevent the Berlaymont situation happening again - they
continue to use a lot of legal jargon to blame contractors rather
than take any practical steps. They also have no deadline to
present a draft law prohibiting imports of illegal timber into
Europe, despite requests from the European Parliament and some
European countries. Such a law would be the surest way of stopping
the EU from consuming illegal timber.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Failure to introduce legislation prohibiting illegal wood
imports is a further blow to the Commission's credibility," said
Sebastien Risso of the Greenpeace European Unit. "Mr Barroso's
administration must take up where this Commission has lagged
behind, rather than carrying on with a business-as-usual approach
of buying wood supplied by illegal loggers."&lt;/p&gt;

	Wangari Maathai has planted tens of millions of trees, opposed genetically modified organisms and titanium mining in her native Kenya, and won numerous awards for her environmental activism. She has also been beaten, harassed, and imprisoned for her work. For the first time in history, the Nobel Committee has recognised the war on planet Earth by conferring upon her the Nobel Peace prize.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Work for a green planet is work for a peaceful planet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world in which Henry Kissinger can receive the prize, and
leaders like Tony Blair and George Bush can be nominated for
killing tens of thousands of civilians on false pretences, it's
good to see real acts of peace acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wangari Maathai, and the Green Belt movement she founded, have
been fighting war with trees. In using forests to combat drought
and ensure biodiversity, activists like Wangari make an essential
link between environmentalism and peace, by ensuring humans stay
within the productive limits of their supporting ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed conflicts bring death and misery to millions of people in
scores of countries around the world every day. Since 1989 the
number of civil wars has tripled. Many of those conflicts are over
limited resources or diminishing land, driven by over-exploitation
of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forests that have housed and protected indigenous
populations for thousands of years are cut down, natural borders
and buffers between people disappear. Sources of livelihood become
scarce. Severe drought and ecosystem collapses bring competition
and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt movement in Kenya in
1977. The group has planted more than 30 million trees across
Africa, primarily by village women, in attempt to stop the massive
deforestation of the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wangari was beaten, harassed, and thrown in jail many times for
her efforts to protect the environment. Throughout her struggles,
she has used the power of non-violence and creative resistance to
advocate for democracy and foil crimes against the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's our kind of Peace Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>One year on, UN takes up Greenpeace Iraq warnings</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/vanishing-nukes-in-iraq/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;IAEA has eye in the sky: Greenpeace had inspectors on the ground&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Mohamed ElBaradei warned the world today that nuclear assets in Iraq have been looted and nuclear materials have disappeared. Greenpeace made that warning more than a year ago when we located radioactive materials and returned them to the nuclear facility at Tuwaitha. Due to US resistance to the UN nuclear watchdog's return to Iraq, it has to rely on satellite images. We saw evidence of the UN concerns on the ground.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/looters-in-abandoned-hangar-at.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/looters-in-abandoned-hangar-at.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace documented looters in abandoned hangar at Tuwaitha nuclear centre in Iraq in June 2003.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When US troops rolled into Baghdad, they ensured that the oil
ministry was immediately under guard. In the south, oil pipelines
and wells were surrounded with armoured vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in Tuwaitha, where Saddam Hussein's nuclear research was
conducted, a site previously sealed by the UN International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and containing nuclear equipment and materials
had not a single soldier outside its door. Local residents took
what they could, including barrels to use for cooking and water
storage that they simply emptied of their uranium yellowcake
contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sent a mission to Iraq in June of 2003 to evaluate the extent
of contamination and to call for the US and the UN to take
immediate action to secure and clean up the site. We brought new
barrels for the local residents to swap for their contaminated
ones. We took measurements in people's homes, in one case finding
radiation levels 10,000 times above background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=614676&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
wrote to Kofi Annan in July 2003 about our concerns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=615959&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
submitted our findings to Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=615965&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
ten-page report&lt;/a&gt; and video documentary in July of 2004, when the
US allowed a limited inspection of the site by the IAEA. Nuclear
expert John Large commented in the report that the evidence
presented by us suggested to him "that a considerable amount of
radioactive material and contamination has been removed from the
secure areas of the Tuwaitha Nuclear Centre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear disaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our letter to ElBaradei listed the materials we found, where we
found them, and stated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is seriously concerned that the looting of the
Tuwaitha facility had been so extensive by the time our team
arrived, that it will be virtually impossible for a team of
inspectors to reconstruct the radioactive inventory prior to the
invasion. And these concerns have been considerably exacerbated in
the last weeks following the revelation that the US has airlifted
considerable quantities of nuclear material from the area without
IAEA oversight."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear material from Iraq has been found in both the
Netherlands and Turkey, showing that nuclear material can and does
leave the country."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Contaminated school near Tuwaitha, Iraq" title="Contaminated school near Tuwaitha, Iraq" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="51172"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Unfortunately,
the contamination stays in Tuwaitha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Mike Townsley said at the time of our
inspection "If this had happened in the UK, the US or any other
country, the villages around Tuwaitha would be swarming with
radiation experts and decontamination teams. It would have been
branded a nuclear disaster site and the people given immediate
medical check-ups. The people of Iraq deserve no less from the
international community. That they are being ignored is a scandal
that must be rectified without delay."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has been done to date. And in their response to our
warning about vanishing inventories, the best the IAEA could say
was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Agency has offered the Iraqi authorities advice on the
safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material.
However, the Agency's assistance is based on requests, and, in line
with the Agency's confidentiality regime, the Agency can only
publish protected information with the consent of the concerned
State or States. Some of your enquiries and suggestions may
therefore more appropriately be directed to the Iraqi Interim
Government [...] At this stage, it is important that IAEA
inspectors return to Iraq..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interim government has also done nothing, the IAEA is still
banned from Iraq by American fiat, and the only winners in this
story are those who are looking to capitalise on security failures
by scoring loose nukes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What was it all for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="51497"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
invasion of Iraq was supposed to be about stopping weapons of mass
destruction. It was supposed to be about stopping nuclear materials
from getting out from under UN control. Was the failure to secure
Tuwaitha a result of incompetence, or evidence of the real priority
of securing Iraq's oil supply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the world is a more dangerous place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a would-be terrorist, the menu of options for securing
nuclear material is getting longer and longer. If you don't feel
like picking up some enriched Uranium to make a dirty bomb from
Iraq, you can find a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=422957"&gt;
lightly guarded truck in France containing Plutonium&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=593488"&gt;
shipload of weapons-grade material&lt;/a&gt; on the high seas from the
US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to ensure nuclear materials don't end up in the
wrong hands is for everyone to give them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need a satellite monitoring system to witness the
looting of nuclear materials and the disassembly of buildings in
Iraq. We videotaped the incidents mentioned in ElBaradei's report,
and you can see them yourself by clicking below:&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Storm Warnings Intensify</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/storm-warnings-intensify/</url><text>
	As this season’s hurricanes slam into our coastlines, MIT scientists have hit us with a dose of reality: global warming is to blame. If you thought that hurricanes were creating greater damage, it hasn’t been your imagination. And the most distressing news is it’s only going to get worse.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/4/trailer-park-homes-were-comple.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/4/trailer-park-homes-were-comple.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Trailer park homes were completely destroyed by hurricane Charlie in 2004.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published by MIT this week, global warming
islikely a major cause of the increased ferocity of hurricanes in
thepast decade. The study, published in the journal Nature, notes
theaccumulated power of hurricanes has more than doubled in the
past 30years, with a particularly dramatic spike since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry Emanuel, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technologyand author of the study writes, "My results suggest that
future warmingmay lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone
destructive potentialand - taking into account an increasing
coastal population - asubstantial increase in hurricane-related
losses in the 21st century."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study should prove particularly interesting for residents
along theGulf Coast and throughout the Caribbean who are recovering
from whatforecasters call the most active start to the hurricane
season onrecord. In just two months, six storms grew strong enough
to meritnames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the 2004 hurricane season, President Bush
visitedthe National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.  He
addressed thecrowd with this assurance: "I want the people of
Florida and otheraffected areas to know that the federal government
is doing everythingwe can to help you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Not Enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Bush is quick to offer kind words and disaster relief
fundsto victims of hurricanes.  Yet his administration refuses to
takeaction on global warming, which would reduce the power of these
stormsand save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 29, the Senate passed the Energy Bill - despite more
than17,000 of our supporters asking it to reject this
badlegislation.  This bill is a triple cocktail of seismic testing
inour waters, incentives to build new nuclear power plants, and
pay-offsfor fossil-fuel giants like ExxonMobil. It will do
virtually nothing toreduce America's growing dependence on oil and
coal and does notaddress global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Good Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executives at President Bush's favorite oil company,
ExxonMobil,are undoubtedly pleased with with the passage of the
Energy Bill.  But theyhave an even bigger reason to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 28, ExxonMobil released its earnings report for the
secondquarter. In a time of steep gas prices, Exxon has broken all
profitrecords, earning $7.84 billion in net income during the 2nd
quarter,and $15.5 billion for the first half of the year total.  In
fact,the $15.5 billion in profits is a 38 percent increase from the
firsthalf of 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Take Action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your money won't end up in ExxonMobil's next
earningsreport.  Don't buy Exxon or Mobil gas, invest in its stock
or workfor the company.  &lt;a href="http://usactions.greenpeace.org/action/start.php?action_id=59"&gt;
Tell Exxon's CEO that he just lost a customer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT isn't the only one noticing how ferocious hurricanes have
become. Hear from ordinary people whose lives have been affected by
hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;

	"Even in an unclassified world this is not the kind of thing you want flying around the Internet," says Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita. He was talking about a document, yanked from a Pentagon website on September 19th, which outlines US nuclear warfighting plans, including the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons and the use of nukes in conventional war.

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;UpdateFebruary, 2006:  The Joint Nuclear
Operations Doctrine andfourother documents have been formally
cancelled by thePentagon. However, this means no substantive change
to US nuclear policy, onlythat the documents have been removed from
the public domain and thePentagon reading list.  &lt;a href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/jcs/canceled.htm"&gt;More
informationfrom the Federation of Amercian Scientists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear war: it's not just for breakfast anymore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thedocument is a rare unpolished look at how the Cold War
doctrine ofnuclear first strike - previously spun as "deterrence" -
has taken on anew dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reveals that the threshold for actually using nuclearweapons
has been lowered dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it outs the untruth ofGeorge Bush claiming that the US is
reducing the importance of itsnuclear arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the document condones pre-emptivenuclear strikes
against nations (even those without nuclear weapons)which the US
government &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;thinks&lt;/span&gt;
might use chemical or biological weaponsagainst US forces or
allies. The document also condones the use ofnuclear weapons as
just another item in the warfighting toolbox, andunderscores the
importance of US troops being able to continuefunctioning in a
highly irradiated battle zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;Thedocument has excellent, practical advice on
how to deal with situationslike a nuclear foe who might retaliate
with nuclear weapons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Executinga nuclear option, or even a portion of an option, should send a clearsignal of United States' resolve. Hence, options must be selected verycarefully and deliberately so that the attack can help ensure theadversary recognizes the "signal" and should therefore not assume theUnited States has escalated to general nuclear war, although thatperception cannot be guaranteed." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It's
comforting to know thatthe Pentagon recognises that nuclear weapons
are very, very bad atconveying nuanced messages. Perhaps if they
accompanied the attack witha thoughtful card, that would help make
their meaning clear? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Fission vision sparks division&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,editing notes show internal disagreement amongst US
militarycommanders. The disputes are over the document's enthusiasm
for usingnuclear weapons in attacks on infrastructure which would
inevitablylead to massive civilian casualties. Some commanders
expressed extremedoubts over both the legality of the new nuclear
doctrine, and that thethreats used to justify this new doctrine
actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;inline_item item_id="209990" mode="story"&gt;The USstrategic command, STRATCOM, which directs nuclear
warfightingcommented "Many operational law attorneys do not believe
"countervalue"targeting is a lawful justification for employment of
force, much lessnuclear force. Countervalue philosophy makes no
distinction betweenpurely civilian activities and military-related
activities and could beused to justify deliberate attacks on
civilians and non-militaryportions of a nation's economy... For
example, under the countervaluetarget philosophy, the attack on the
World Trade Centre Towers on 9/11could be justified."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since it's not illegal, it must be ok&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ina chilling finale, "Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations"
concludesthat "no customary or conventional international law
prohibits nationsfrom employing nuclear weapons in armed
conflict." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeacedisarmament campaigner William Peden said, "This
document should send ashiver down the spine of everyone. It shows
that the highest levels ofthe Pentagon have undergone a major shift
in thinking and now viewnuclear weapons no longer as a weapon of
last resort but a weapon thatcan and should be used."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This means a US military machineprepared to use nuclear weapons
first, against non-nuclear countries andnon-military-related,
civilian targets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make sure the Pentagon's plans for nuclear war fly around the internet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/nuclear-warplans-101?mode=send"&gt;Nuclear warfighting plans concern all of us -- they shouldn't be kept secret.

	George Bush's government is out in the cold over Kyoto - and it's that old Cold War enemy, Russia, that's put it there. The Russian government has moved closer towards ratifying the crucial Kyoto climate change treaty. But while Bush hangs out in hurricane-ravaged Florida before his first election debate, the US government continues to criticise the Kyoto Treaty.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists in 19 countries demonstrated in 2003 in front of Russian Embassies urging President Putin to sign the Kyoto Protocol.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The tipping point&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Putin's motives, the fact that he and the Russian
government have taken this first step is undoubtedly good news for
anyone worried about climate change - and a slap in the face for
George Bush and oil companies like ExxonMobil. The Kyoto
ratification comes as a breath of fresh (and unpolluted) air at a
time when news headlines are dominated by oil dependency and
extreme weather horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the Earth is battered by increasing storms, floods and
droughts, President Putin has brought us to a pivotal point in
human history today," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner, Steve
Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final decision about whether or not Russia will ratify Kyoto
now rests with the Russian Parliament, the Duma. If it votes in
favour, the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force and will become
international law, a decision likely to happen within a few weeks.
The Protocol must be ratified by no less than 55 countries
accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions in 1990, so
Russia could finally tip the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Meanwhile, back at the ranch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But George W. Bush insists on raining on the parade. The US
emits one fifth of the world's greenhouse gases, so unless the US
ratifies or at the very least changes its domestic policies - a
scenario distinctly unlikely under Bush - Kyoto will not fully
achieve its targets. "Kyoto is 'an unrealistic and ever-tightening
regulatory straitjacket, curtailing energy consumption'," said the
US Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, in the &lt;i&gt;Financial
Times&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Australia have not yet ratified the treaty, but they
are definitely out in the cold on this one - as of July 29th 2004,
124 countries had ratified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an important first step in tackling
climate change - but there is still a long way to go. "To tackle
climate change we must stop relying on oil, coal and gas to meet
our energy needs and urgently redirect our investment into safer,
cleaner sources of energy such as wind, wave and solar power," said
Steve Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

	At the opening of the Premier Vision textile exhibition in Paris, activists dressed in black t-shirts - each one revealing the faces of Bhopal victims - confronted Dow Chemical as the company presented its new fibre, XLA. Dow Chemical is responsible for the 1984 disaster in the Indian city of Bhopal - a tragedy that still continues, even twenty years later.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-displays-a-banner-w.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-displays-a-banner-w.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace displays a banner with pictures of the victims of the world's worst industrial disaster-Bhopal- at the opening of an international textile exhibition in Paris, where DOW Chemical, the entity responsible for the 1984 disaster presented a new fibre called XLA. We're asking asking Dow Chemical to face its moral and financial responsibilities before investing in new markets.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Dow launch, our activists displayed a massive banner showing pictures of the world's worst industrial disaster and distributed 4,000 flyers regarding the company's corporate irresponsibility. Along with the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal - an International coalition of Bhopal survivors and International NGOs campaigning for justice in Bhopal - we demand that Dow accepts full liability for the ongoing disaster in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Dow representatives claimed that their textile launch had nothing to do with corporate accountability, and refused to meet any of the Bhopal survivors - suggesting that Dow cares more about its new line of fabrics than the plight of thousands of Bhopalis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, a delegation from Dow France arrived, and quickly agreed to meet our team and the young Bhopal victims. During the meeting, the General Manager of Dow France, Pierre-Jean Brochand, promised to answer survivors' questions on what Dow will do about the clean up of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were really surprised - Dow really didn't expect us to show up at a textile show. But then we were astonished to find them taking such a proactive stance. Most of the time Dow try to avoid us - this time they seemed to have been softened up, and a little threatened by our sudden appearance. The outcome was that we managed to me M. Brochand, who has promised to get us answers in the next few days. We need to know what they're going to do about the clean up of Bhopal - and what they're not going to do," said Greenpeace France campaigner Aurele Clemencin, who was at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bhopal disaster occured on 3 December 1984, when more than 40 tonnes of poisonous gases leaked from a storage tank at a Union Carbide (now owned by Dow) pesticide factory into the heart of Bhopal, immediately killing 8,000 people. In the last twenty years, another 20,000 people have died from illnesses caused by the disaster. Survivors and their children are still dealing with the long-term health effects, including cancer, tuberculosis, birth defects and chronic fevers. In June 2004, the Government of India submitted a statement to the New York District Court on the Bhopal contamination clean up case, asking Union Carbide to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The people affected by the disaster now live in the shadow of an ongoing environmental and health catastrophe. The banner that carries the faces of the Bhopali victims reveals the hidden collection of Dow - the real story of Bhopal after twenty years. We, the people of Bhopal have suffered for 20 years now and it is disheartening to discover that instead of taking responsibility for cleaning up the polluted disaster site in Bhopal and offering medical assistance to the ailing survivors, Dow is busy making profits." Said Rani Niloufer, one of the Bhopal survivor who met with Dow. Rani was born the year of the disaster, and still suffers from the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow should pay for the health treatments of the survivors, and clean up both the large stockpiles of dangerous poisons and the contaminated underground water left behind at the accident site. Our activists have worked in Bhopal since 1999. Back then, a when a team of our scientists worked with Bhopal community groups, analysing the severity and extent of the contamination on and around the factory site. We found severe contamination of both land and water supplies by heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dow investors, and all those who will buy this fabric, should be aware that Dow has blood on their hands and no new textile will help them hide their crimes in Bhopal. Only when they pay for all the survivors' health treatments and clean up the poisonous site, will justice be done," added Vinuta Gopal, Greenpeace campaigner from India protesting today in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Dow really answer the questions of the Bhopal victims? Stay tuned to find out...&lt;/p&gt;

	After weeks of cat-and-mouse antics, the Pacific Pintail slipped into the port of Cherbourg with a deadly cargo of Plutonium -- but only after a French court ensured Greenpeace would be kept out of the way.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists onboard the Greenpeace ship MV Esperanza wait off the coast of France for the imminent arrival of the Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the cover of darkness, the Pintail -- one of two vessels
carrying a plutonium shipment from Charleston, South Carolina --
was escorted by sister vessel the Pacific Teal, all the while being
tracked by the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza. It arrived at the dock
at 5:45 AM, to be met by six yachts from the Atlantic Nuclear Free
Flotilla flying "Stop Plutonium" banners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An escort of six security inflatables with marine commandos,
four military boats and two helicopters was also waiting and
guarded the vessel as it entered the French port. The French
Gendarmerie also established a closed security zone in the harbour
in an attempt to stop any protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment of weapons plutonium is a wake-up call to the
world - rather than ship this dangerous material worldwide, now is
the time for aggressive steps to halt proliferation of all nuclear
weapons materials," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace
International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="67847"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The military nature of the arrival in France clearly
demonstrates that nuclear weapons materials are a threat to global
security and have no place in commerce."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being unloaded in La Hague, the cargo of 140 kg of
plutonium oxide will be transported in the coming 24 hours more
than 1,000 kilometres to a plutonium fuel fabrication facility in
Caradache, Provence, in the South of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route has not been announced for the land transport which is
perhaps the most vulnerable stage in terms of accident or terrorist
attack. Areva plans to convert the plutonium into an experimental
fuel known as 'MOX' (mixed plutonium uranium oxide fuel), after
which it transported back to the US early in 2005, to then be
tested in US reactor over three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Transportation of plutonium is highly vulnerable to accidents
or deliberate attack and must be stopped. After the Atlantic
crossing this transport is about to wind its way through France
threatening everything in its path. It will be too late if there is
a disaster to inform the people of France - that is what Greenpeace
is determined to do over these coming days," said Shaun Burnie of
Greenpeace International.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="67874"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to the transport, as it is part of a
global programme led by France's state-owned nuclear company Areva,
and the governments of the US and Russia, to commercialise the
large-scale use of weapons-grade plutonium as fuel in nuclear
reactors. Such a program not only increases the vulnerability of
plutonium but also sends the wrong nuclear proliferation signal
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the claimed secrecy of the transport routes, Greenpeace
has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/428875/0/transport.swf"&gt;
routinely tracked and photographed nuclear shipments&lt;/a&gt; in
France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this weapons-grade plutonium fuel experiment succeeds, a
total of 68 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from US and Russian
weapons stockpiles - enough to make more than 15,000 nuclear bombs
- will be exposed to theft, diversion and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

	LATEST UPDATES: www.stop-plutonium.orgThanks to the Bush Administration's disregard for global concerns about nuclear proliferation, two ships carrying some 140kg of weapons-grade plutonium are en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Cherbourg in France.  The two lightly armed UK-flagged commercial nuclear ships are now somewhere off the coast of France, waiting until a possible injunction is served against Greenpeace, to dock.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists spend the night waiting for the imminent arrival of two BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) ships, which are carrying 140kg of radioactive weapons-grade plutonium. The Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal left the U.S. port of Charleston, SC on September 20th.  Greenpeace believes the shipment conducted by the US and France is unnecessarily threatening international security and putting the environment at risk.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US lacks a suitable nuclear facility for converting this
potential weapons material into experimental plutonium fuel (MOX) -
so the Bush Administration is allowing it to be shipped around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment began its journey at the US Department of Energy's
Los Alamos nuclear weapons facility in New Mexico, and covered
almost 2,500km before arriving in Charleston. The ships left North
Carolina and passed close to the Irish coast on their way to
Cherbourg. Once unloaded the shipment will cover up to 1200km of
roads before arriving at a closed plutonium fuel fabrication
facility in Cadarache, in the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, two workers were contaminated during a
nuclear accident involving plutonium at the Cadarache facility,
which is operated by the state-owned nuclear company Areva/Cogema.
As for the Los Alamos National Laboratory - operations there were
recently suspended after classified data 'went missing'.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="66833"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total journey for the plutonium shipment? A ridiculous
6589km!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the US and France, local groups have mounted strong
opposition to shipments, including the Nuclear-Free Atlantic
Flotilla and Citizens Against Plutonium. Greenpeace also has been
waiting patiently for the shipment to arrive and holding peaceful
protests however the local authorities have responded with a heavy
hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene Riguidel, one of France's most famous sailors, John
Castle of Guernsey and Pernilla Svenberg from Greenpeace
International were arrested for mounting a peaceful protest inside
the military port against the plutonium shipment. Although they
were released within 24 hours from the military arsenal in
Cherbourg, Greenpeace has been summoned to appear in the Cherbourg
Court to face a request by Areva, through its subsidiary Cogema,
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), for an injunction preventing
it from approaching within 300m of the two ships carrying plutonium
or within 100m of the Cherbourg harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment sends the strongest signal that the US holds
little regard for global efforts to keep nuclear weapons materials
out of commerce," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace International.
"It is the height of arrogance to conduct a shipment like this
while demanding other nations refrain from proliferating nuclear
weapons materials and technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Charleston, Citizens Against Plutonium (CAP) was formed in
response to the nuclear shipment, and to the refusal of the US
Department of Energy to prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment
on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How sensible is it to sail a ship carrying plutonium round the
world at a time when world security is volatile? Whenever such a
deadly substance is moved, there will be a risk of accidents or
terrorist attacks. In the event of an incident, plutonium could be
dispersed into the ocean, poisoning people and the marine
environment on which we depend," said local Charleston resident
Merrill Chapman of Citizens Against Plutonium.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="67469"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Homeland Security wrote to Representative
Ed Markey on September 8, telling him that "Coast Guard cutters,
boats, aircraft and other local law enforcement and Navy assets"
would be involved securing the passage of the ship. While the same
letter admitted that no "formal threat assessment" had been
prepared on the shipment, it seems that the Coast Guard had
prepared "a field intelligence report" on environmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This transport is part of a misguided plan to put weapons
plutonium into commercial use by converting it into MOX fuel for
use in nuclear reactors. This is an expensive and dangerous way to
dispose of plutonium. All existing plutonium should be secured and
mixed with nuclear waste and vitrified in robust containers, "
concluded Clements.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our Argentine Ocean Defenders have hit Nissui in their pockets. Nissui own about one third of Kyodo Senpaku -- the people who run the Japanese whaling fleet. Our cyberactivists have convinced a major Nissui client in Argentina not to buy from a corporation involved in the killing of whales.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/whalesvictoryargentina.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/whalesvictoryargentina.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Despite the continued killing of whales by Japan there was some good news for whales when a Argentine seafood company canceled a contract with Nissui, a Japanese corporation involved in whaling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as directly confronting the whaling fleet in the
Southern Oceanwe have been exposing howmany well-known companies
are linked to corporations involved inwhaling. Internationally we
have been &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/our-oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;focussing
on Gorton's&lt;/a&gt;,but in Argentina the focus is on companies that do
business with one ofthe corporations most closely linked to whaling
in Japan, Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissui has Argentine subsidiaries that operate freezer trawlers,
one ofwhich is a surimi (type of minced fish) processor, which is
sold inArgentina, Uruguay and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="story" item_id="298576"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular seafood company in Argentina, Pesquera Santa Elena was
usingNissui fish in its products. So we targeted Santa Elena to ask
them tostop buying from Nissui and make it clear that whaling is
bad forbusiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just 2 days over 21,000 cyberactivists contacted the company
anddownloaded stickers to place on Santa Elena products in super
markets,to highlight that the company was implicated in the killing
of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably quickly the president of Santa Elena was sitting at
thetable with us to negotiate. Faced with the possible damage to
thecompanies public image from being linked to whaling it was
anapparently easy decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Greenpeace Argentina got a signed commitment from
thepresident of Santa Elena not to buy any more surimi from Nissui.
Thecompany even committed to donate about US$60,000 to an
organisationworking on whale conservation if they ever violate the
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one big client less for Nissui, and we are pressing other
companiesto follow suit. Maybe Gorton's can learn from Santa
Elena's goodexample? In Argentina we are now focussing on other
companies that buyfrom Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=1217756"&gt;Stand up to make a difference for the whales - Tell Gorton's and Nissui that their customers do not support whaling!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=argentinavictory"&gt;We rely on individual donations to fund our work challenging the whalers on the high seas and their corporate backers in the world of commerce. Give today to help save whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Following a meeting yesterday with the Norwegian Transport Minister, Ford Europe has confirmed it will not scrap its US fleet of zero emission electric cars, but instead send them to eager customers in Norway.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-reverses-plans-to-crush-a.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-reverses-plans-to-crush-a.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ford reverses plans to crush all its electric Th!nk cars. Ford had planned on crushing this environmental solution because it succeeded in trashing the California legislation that encouraged their use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford was planning to scrap their US fleet of electric Th!nk
vehicles,but following pressure from us and other environmental
groups, the carmanufacturer has changed its mind. Last month, our
activists occupiedthe roof of Ford Norway's offices, prompting
Norwegian Transport andCommunications Minister Torild Skogsholm to
ask Ford to Th!nk again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 300 of the cars will now be shipped to Norway, and sold
throughFord dealerships to eager customers. Ford has even thanked
Greenpeacefor having brought this issue to their attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford had attempted to justify scrapping the cars by citing a
lack ofUS government regulation, and have since claimed that some
180 of thecars have already been scrapped. This was despite the
Th!nk car'spopularity with American consumers - there's been
waiting lists to buythe cars since the hugely popular leasing
period started in 2001.Zero-emission cars reduce urban smog, and
when charged by electricityfrom renewable sources, they help fight
the biggest threat to ourplanet: climate change. With rising oil
prices causing increasedgasoline costs, they are also a sound
economic choice. Popular, cleanand efficient, shouldn't this be
part of the future of transport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's initial U-turn - which highlights how ludicrous the
originalplan to crush the electric cars was - took little over a
week. Weannounced it on September 1st, and it has taken another two
weeks toget confirmation. The first batch of cars is due to arrive
in Norway inNovember, thanks to shipping company Wallenius
Wilhelmsen, with morecars to follow in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is all good news, it seems this corporate leopard
doesn'tchange its oily spots so easily. Ford still has the most
fossil fuelhungry fleet of cars in the US. In the same week it
reversed thecrushing decision, Ford CEO Bill Ford wrote a letter to
Californiagovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposing a proposed law
that wouldencourage purchases of the most fuel-efficient cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not scrapping electric cars is a start, Ford should now
befocusing on is producing environmentally friendly, zero
emissionvehicles for the mass market. Currently the company likes
to market agreen image even though its current fleet of cars is
actually lessefficient than the 80-year-old Model-T Ford!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford should stop hiding behind empty talk about experimental
fuelcells, and instead do as Henry Ford would have done;
continuouslyimprove efficiency and establish mass production of the
most advancedzero emissions technology available today - modern
battery electricvehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

	A four-year-old scandal involving the MV Ulla, a vessel carrying hazardous waste from Spain, finally came to a head on Monday outside the Turkish port of Iskenderun, where the vessel sank taking 2000 tons of hazardous waste with it.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/a-four-year-old-scandal-involv.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The MV Ulla sank, burying 2000 tons of toxic waste into the sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Turkish authorities, the fly ash, which came from
the burning of coal in three power plants in the North of Spain,
seeped into the sea when the MV Ulla started sinking on 6
September. The vessel had been docked in Turkey for over four years
after the Turkish authorities had refused the hazardous cargo to be
off-loaded on its shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environmental fiasco started back in 1999 when 3,488 tons
of hazardous fly ash was loaded onto the MV Ulla in Spain. The
hazardous waste was to be sent to the Spanish company S.A. P/C De
Dragados in Algeria. But following Algeria's rejection of the
hazardous cargo, the ship mysteriously ended up in Turkey. Dragados
claimed that the cargo was damaged as a result of bad loading in
Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waste contained chromium VI - a highly toxic heavy metal -
environmentally hazardous as well as dangerous for humans. The
responsibility for its return lay with the Spanish government,
since the ship loaded its hazardous waste in Spain. However neither
the Turkish nor the Spanish authorities bothered taking any
precautions to contain the environmental hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="The MV Ulla, a vessel carrying hazardous waste, during its sinking in Iskenderun port, Turkey." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="66545"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Since
the entry of such hazardous waste into Turkey is banned under both
national and international legislation (Basel Convention), the
Turkish government had been urging the Spanish government to take
back the ship. In January 2002 they again urged the Spanish
government and the Basel Secretariat to resolve this problem. It
seems that no one wanted to take responsability for this
environmental time bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the ship has sunk, the Basel Convention does not
provide liability provision for cleaning up the mess. However, the
Spanish government are reportedly offering to help in the clean-up
operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this seems too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's good to know that Spain is willing to help, but both
countries should have acted way too late on this matter. Four years
is too much time to spend on a clear case of waste trade scandal.
This wreck and damage at the bottom of the blue Mediterranean sea
would have been avoided if Spain and Turkey has acted on time",
said Banu Dockmecibasi, Greenpeace Turkey Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning 70 international Greenpeace activists uncovered thousands of tonnes of Genetically Engineered (GE) soya in warehouses in the Italian port of Ravenna. Recent samples taken from one of the warehouses have proven to be GE positive. Activists are currently preventing any GE soya from leaving the facility and are taking further samples.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            GE camaigners target warehouses in Ravenna, Italy
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This next stage of the European leg of our GE campaign has seen
activists cordoning off the area around the warehouses and
displaying banners declaring 'Europe says no to GMOs' and 'No to GE
Food'. Our aim is to make Ravenna a GE-Free zone and to end all GE
soya imports in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our Italian activists Paola Lipari describes how this
morning's events unrolled: "We wanted to find either soya beans or
soya meal to analyse to find out what was GE. We formed two teams.
The first went towards the warehouse of 'Docks Cereali' company and
the second toward 'Eurodocks'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We entered the facility around 5.45 am with no problems. A
security man asked us what we were doing there and we told him that
we were trying to find soya to take samples to analyse. We added
that we are not meant to interfere with their job. We found huge
mountains of soya meal stocked into the warehouse. Finally we found
soya beans and took samples from it carefully sealing them on
plastic bags. We reached the exit but most of it was taken by the
police, but still, some remained safe and we were able to carry it
outside. In the meanwhile the second sample team also got

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;" ravenna is main entry point of ge contamination into italy said our italian campaigner federica ferrario. soya being grown feed vast profits a few large farmers and global agri-business companies such as bunge cargill dreyfus. these plus others control seeds trucks shipping processing this soya. they also import market could within one year supply non-ge for every all if so choose.&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our GE campaigners are yet again challenging these
multi-national companies, who are buying GE soya, to answer our
questions so that consumers in Europe and farmers in Latin America
can choose to go GE free. This is what we want to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they only import GE soya or, do they also import non-GE
soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they keep the non-GE separate from the GE soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Which food companies buy these GE soya imports and which food
products are they being used to produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Will they label the meat and dairy products from the animals
that eat this GE soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they want our protest to continue or do they want to give a
commitment to make Ravenna GE Free, as a first step to making all
imports to Italy GE Free?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy currently imports 4.2 million tonnes of soya annually for
food and for animal feed. The port of Ravenna accounts for an
estimated 2 million tonnes of these imports and so is the main
entry point for GE contamination into Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management of the nearby Bunge/Cereol soya bean processing
facility has told us that they are currently GE-free because they
are importing non-GE soya from Brazil, however they added that they
may re-start GE imports as of October. Bunge/Cereol has two other
soya bean processing facilities in Italy in Ancona and Porta
Maghera which import GE soya meal from Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto, our GE campaigner from Argentina in Ravenna
commented: "GE soya covers over 14 million hectares in Argentina.
It is green but it is a desert. Now forest is being logged to clear
the land for GE soya production. For the future health and wealth
of Argentina the GM soya monoculture must be stopped."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's activities follow on from another important action
yesterday, in Chioggia, Italy. The Esperanza intercepted the
Panama-registered bulk carrier, 'Keoyang Majesty' carrying 40,000
thousands tonnes GE soya from Argentina and demanded an end to the
massive contamination of the Italian food supply from these GE
imports. Some of our activists are still on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activities in Latin America are also going well, over the
weekend we had a victory in Brazil. Another Argentinean ship
'Global Wind', which we had been tracking for a few weeks, left the
GE-free port of Paranagua. After 19 hours our action came to an end
as our activists prevented non GE soya being loaded onto the GE
contaminated ship.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            What do these have in common? A grave threat to civil liberties: a US lawsuit against Greenpeace calling us sailormongerers for protecting the Amazon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 33-year history of Greenpeace the most unexpected
people have come together to protect the environment and used non-
violent direct action to highlight environmental crimes and
injustice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this collection is perhaps one of the most extraordinary.
What they do in the coming weeks could have significant
implications not only for the future of Greenpeace in the US, but
also for civil disobedience and the right to freedom of speech for
all in America and even beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, on May 17th, Greenpeace USA will be under threat of
being declared a criminal organisation at the behest of the US
Attorney General, under an obscure law that has been invoked only
twice in its 130 years on the statute books - the last time was
more than 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual activists have been prosecuted in the past for
carrying out action in support of Greenpeace campaigns worldwide -
it is not unusual, and those individuals are prepared to take the
consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, six Greenpeace activists did just that. After two
of them boarded a commercial ship, the APL Jade, which was bringing
illegal mahogany into the port of Miami, Florida, they pleaded
guilty, were fined and sentenced to "time served" - the weekend
they all spent in jail. The judicial process had run its
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so we thought. 15 months later Greenpeace USA headquarters in
Washington was served notice that the US Attorney General's office
would be prosecuting the entire organisation for the action - the
first time in history that the US Government has prosecuted an
advocacy group for a free-speech related activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of a few weeks, US law could be used in an
unprecedented way to declare Greenpeace USA a criminal
organisation, as a result of acting to protect Brazilian mahogany -
a species now declared at risk according to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is worth
noting here that at the time of the CITES declaration, many
governments congratulated Greenpeace for the years of campaign work
to protect the species. Now one government is prosecuting us for
doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenpeace sits in the dock in Miami, the loggers,
shippers and traders of that illegal mahogany have cashed in and
laughed at the law. Illegally logged wood is still going to the US
and other countries around the world, the criminal underworld is
still operating in the heart of the Amazon, those trying to protect
the world's greatest rainforest are still operating under threat of
death and sometimes dying, and countries like the US are still
failing to live up to their promise under CITES to protect
mahogany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this case is not just about Greenpeace and the Amazon. On
trial is also the fundamental and cherished right to freedom of
speech and civil disobedience. Many leaders and other advocacy
groups in the US have recognised the great risk to civil liberties
this prosecution presents and are supporting Greenpeace. They
include former US Vice President Al Gore, the civil rights leader
Julian Bond and the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
Sierra Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, back to the original question. Who are all these
characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="bodystd" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/hilary.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Hilary Hosta" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Hilary Hosta is a young woman from California who spent a weekend in jail and was subsequently convicted with the other five Greenpeace supporters of taking action against the APL Jade - the  ship bringing the illegal logged mahogany into the Port of Miami, Florida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/rose.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Rose Young" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Rose Young is an Italian American who has worked for Greenpeace for most of her adult life after running away from home in her teenage years. Now a grandmother of five and mother of three, she has been at the heart of some of Greenpeace's most successful campaigns worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Jane Moscowitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Jane Moscowitz is one of the top criminal defense lawyers in Miami, Florida. Environmental prosecutions are not normally on her case book, but this is not a normal case...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/hamilton.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Hamilton Casara" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Hamilton Casara is a member of Brazil's Chamber of Deputies and former President of IBAMA, the environmental enforcement agency of Brazil. He has first hand knowledge of the value of Greenpeace's environmental work in Brazil and beyond: "We are grateful to Greenpeace for helping us preserve the forests, it is very important to defend democratic principles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/ashcroft.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Evil incarnate" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;John Ashcroft is the man at the top of the US Department of Justice, who believe Greenpeace USA should be declared criminal for alerting the authorities to a crime that was about to happen on US soil. He is ultimately responsible for risking all our rights to freedom of speech through this prosecution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;David Halperin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;David Halperin is a lawyer and former White House aide for Bill Clinton. Today he is representing Greenpeace USA in court to ensure that the real criminals are brought to before the courts, not an environmental organisation that is upholding the rights of freedom of speech and protest while working to protect the Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/paulo.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Paulo Adario" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Paulo Adario has worked for Greenpeace in the heart of the Amazon for many years. He has seen the consequences of the illegal and unsustainable trade in mahogany and other wood first hand, witnessed the use of violence and slavery that is endemic in the logging industry, known environmental activists who have been murdered as they tried to protect the greatest rainforest in the world and is himself under threat of death for his work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/cancan.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Evil incarnate" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;"Sailormongering" was the conduct that an 1872 US law was aimed at preventing, the practice of tavern and brothel owners  waylaying ships heading into port and enticing their crews ashore, stealing their money and rendering the ship unable to function. It has been used twice in 130 years. This is the law under which Greenpeace USA has been indicted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/amazon.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="The Amazon" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;The Amazon rainforest is the lungs of the world. It has almost unimaginable biodiversity, is home to tens of millions of people and a vital component in the fight against global warming. And still it is being systematically stripped by money hungry, corrupt logging companies ready to use any means necessary. If we do not continue to act to protect it, it will be lost forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these folks will be in Miami in the lead up to and during
the trial, with the exception of John Ashcroft, the monkey, and the
19th century prostitute. Sadly, Ashcroft is not required to give
evidence about why the Bush Administration feels the need to outlaw
Greenpeace, nor will he be able to answer why the Bush
Administration feels the need to allow the real criminals to go
unpunished and the Amazon to continue to be plundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/bin/view.fpl/10048/action_id/195.html"&gt;
Tell Bush&lt;/a&gt; to prosecute illegal loggers, not peaceful
protestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Join Greenpeace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions even more when we're
under attack from the US government. In order to ensure that we
remain an independent voice for the planet, we don't accept
corporate or government funds: we rely on the small donations of
millions of supporters. Greenpeace exists because this fragile
earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It
needs action. Please &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/join"&gt;help by becoming a
supporter today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning our 'Gene Detectives' from the Esperanza intercepted and boarded the 'Winner' a ship carrying thousands of tons of GE soya where it is anchored just off Malaga in southern Spain.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists today occupy the cranes of the
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 8am this morning our climbers boarded the Winner - or as we
like to call it the Loser - from inflatable boats. Six volunteers
climbed onto the ship's cranes (to prevent them being used to
off-load any GE cargo) another two carried banners in English and
Spanish saying, 'Spain does not want GE Food' and 'We don't want GE
Food' one went on the mast and another on the anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Keenan, our GE Campaigner onboard the Esperanza said:
"GE soya does not feed the world as suggested by the misleading and
cynical marketing of GE companies like Monsanto. GE soya destroys
the environment where it is grown in Argentina and then millions of
tons of it are used to feed pigs, cows and chickens in Europe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Winner from Argentina is carrying about 9,000 tons of GE
soya and about 11,000 tons of maize for the company Nidera. The GE
status of the maize is not known at this time. However our 'Gene
Detectives' have demanded documentation from the captain of the
Winner to find out exactly what GE crops his ship is carrying. We
have also taken samples for independent analysis. 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" winner="." alt="Greenpeace activists taking samples of maize from the hold of the " vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59184"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain is the second largest importer of soya into the EU,
importing 6 million tons annually from the USA, Argentina and
Brazil, of which over 4 million tons are estimated to be GE
contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In Argentina we have people going to bed hungry yet between
1997 and 2002 farmers in Argentina planted GE soya in over 14
million hectares of arable land, lured by the promises of higher
crop yields and cheaper seeds," said Daniela Montalto, our
campaigner from Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For a while the illusion worked, but now the truth is we are
facing an environmental and social nightmare in Argentina. We
invite people the world over to reject GMOs in favor of real,
sustainable agriculture which feeds people not pigs and we invite
people to also vote with their wallet - don't buy GE food."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise have prevented the entrance of the 'Global Wind' ship into the port of Paranagua, Brazil. The ship is carrying 30 000 tons of Genetically Engineered (GE) soya from Argentina.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace activist chains himself to the anchor chain of bulk carrier 'Global Wind', a ship carrying GM Soya from Argentina planning to
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our activists left the Arctic Sunrise around 10 AM. Just 10
minutes were enough for them to reach the Global Wind. Pablo, an
activist from Argentina, chained himself to the anchor and labelled
it with a GE banner, his presence also prevented the ship going
into the port with its contaminated shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraná, the second biggest soya producer in Brazil banned the
growing, transport and export of GE soya in its territory last year
after the federal government gave temporary approval for GE soya.
Paranagua is the only port in Brazil that implements strong
measures to keep its export free of GE contamination despite the
fact that it is under huge pressure to accept GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global Wind is comming from Argentina half loaded with GE soya.
Its aim is to complete its cargo with non-GE soya at the Port of
Paranagua. Obviously, we couldn't let so much effort to produce
non-GE soya be in vain if this cargo would be mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A Greenpeace chains himself to the anchor of the Global Wind to protest against GE soya." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59379"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
economical advantage of being one of the only major world suppliers
of non-GE soya could be lost if there is no control to avoid
contamination," said Gabriela Vuolo, our campaigner on board of the
Arctic Sunrise. "Greenpeace demands assurances from the government
that it is not allowing Brazilian non-GE soya exports to be
threatened."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Brazil's federal government allowed GE soya to enter
the country and it has not taken the necessary measures to
guarantee that the proper use of documentation and information to
track these crops is followed as the national and international
legislation require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The federal government must support the efforts of Paraná state
to remain non-GE, and should immediately implement thorough control
measure to prevent GE contamination," said Gabriela Vuolo. "It must
support Paraná's ban and extend the ban on GE soya to include GE
shipments coming to be "top-loaded" with non-GE. Other Brazilian
states should also to follow Paraná's example."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo stayed on the anchor until 2 PM, when Lata, a Brazilian
activist, went there to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Canadian harp seal hunt: largest ever</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/harp-seal-hunt/</url><text>
	The Canadian government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 350,000 animals this year. While "whitecoat" harp seals (under 2 weeks old) are still protected as a result of actions by Greenpeace and other organisations in the 70s and 80s, and some of the more extreme animal rights abuses have been outlawed, older seals can still be legally hunted under Canadian law.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace  activist sprays a seal with harmless dye to render its pelt worthless to commercial hunters in 1982.  An EU ban on killing harp seals under 2 weeks old put an end to the commercial hunt for whitecoats -- but not to the killing of older seals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's quota is the highest for any year since 1967.
Canada's cod fishery collapsed in the early 90s, and some in Canada
blamed the seals, despite the fact that the greatest culprit was
clearly decades of human overfishing. The collapse of fisheries
around Newfoundland due to mismanagement are a major driver in the
economics of expanding the seal hunt -- and part of an all too
predictable cycle of "exploit, deplete, and move on" which have
characterised human commercial hunts of wild animals the world
over. History has taught us that as soon as a market exists and
profits are to be made, the pressure to hunt a species beyond
sustainable population levels will inevitably lead to a
non-sustainable hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oppose any human activity harmful to populations of seals. We
oppose the killing of seals for commercial trade. We oppose taking
animals from endangered, threatened or seriously reduced
populations, from populations whose status is unknown or where it
is thought a hunt may have an adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add new uncertainties about how global warming is
impacting fragile arctic environments, an expanded hunt means the
impacts on seal populations are at best uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned
against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since
that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, and other organisations, have taken the lead in
campaigning against the slaughter of seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and other organisations taking action against the
commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Monsanto and the US Government have been telling the world that genetically engineered crops pose no contamination threat to natural indigenous species.  But Greenpeace has learned from a leaked report that NAFTA disagrees and is recommending steps to avoid a genetic threat to natural maize in Mexico. Surprise, surprise: the Bush Administration is attempting to suppress the report.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            NAFTA agrees: US genetically engineered maize is  threat to Mexican crops.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, written by the Commission for Environmental
Cooperation (CEC) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (US,
Canada and Mexico) recommends that all genetically engineered (GE)
maize imports be labelled as such and that all US maize entering
Mexico should be milled upon entry, to prevent living seeds from
being planted intentionally or accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush Administration has intervened several times to delay
the publication of the report -- completed three months ago -- and
there is still no official date for its publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal began in September 2001 when the Mexican government
announced that scientists had discovered contamination of
indigenous varieties of maize with genetically engineered (GE)
varieties. The likely source of the contamination is imported maize
from the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigenous and local communities in Oaxaca were horrified, and
non-governmental environmental organizations in Mexico started a
campaign to bring the contamination to the attention of the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the genetic home of maize, Mexico is on the forefront of
natural diversity in the crop. There are hundreds of local and wild
varieties of Mexican maize, all of which could be marginalised and
overtaken by aggressive GE strains. Loss of these varieties would
put the world's food security at risk since farmers rely on these
genetic resources to create new varieties, especially ones adapted
to changing environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things Mexico did was to request the CEC to
look into the matter. The CEC began a process to investigate the
contamination; possible impacts on human health, communities, and
the environment; and eventually to provide recommendations to the
three NAFTA governments on how to address the contamination. The
CEC finished the long-awaited report on the contamination of
Mexican maize by US GE maize way back in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Mexican activists place sacks of imported maize seeds (conventional and ge mix) from the US at the entrance of the Environment Secretariat." border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="68415"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
recognition of real environmental risks of GE maize and the
consequent recommendation to mill US maize upon entry into Mexico
will clearly damage the US position in its WTO case against Europe.
It is no wonder they worked so hard to try to prevent its release,"
said Doreen Stabinsky, genetic engineering campaigner for
Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least two reasons why the US might want to delay
publication of a report that highlights the environmental, human
health and socio-cultural risks of GE maize. First, inside sources
have alluded to the potential implications of the report on the WTO
case being brought by the US and Canada against the European
Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the U.S., Canada and Argentina launched a case against
the European Union for a de facto moratorium on new approvals on GE
varieties in place in Europe since 1998. The CEC report is likely
to provide strong support for Europe's scientific arguments. It
calls attention to the huge gaps in knowledge that exist regarding
the impacts of GE maize in Mexico, stating explicitly that risk
assessments carried out in the United States are not adequate to
determine potential impacts in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The WTO suit was clearly a politically motivated attack on the
environment and on European consumers. It is highly significant
that another trade body has now confirmed that there are unique
risks to genetically engineered organisms and that there is
scientific backing for a precautionary approach on genetic
engineering," said Stabinsky. "The only appropriate next step for
the US government is to follow the CEC's recommendations and mill
their maize exports."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report will also clearly have an effect on the current US
efforts to send GE maize as food aid. A number of African countries
have rejected whole US maize as a potential threat to their
environment, and requested only milled maize. The report backs up
these demands as it concludes that there is insufficient data on
which to conclude safety of transgenic maize for the Mexican
environment and recommends milling of maize to reduce these
risks.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Jury trial awarded in Bush vs. Greenpeace</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/jury-for-bush-vs-greenpeace/</url><text>
	A US federal judge in Miami today granted our motion for a jury trial against unprecedented criminal charges, setting the stage for a courtroom battle that could have a significant impact on Americans'  rights to peaceful protest. In July 2003, the Justice Department charged Greenpeace under an obscure 1872 law against "sailormongering" for a 2002 protest. Judge Adalberto Jordan, agreeing with Greenpeace's assertion, found that "the indictment is a rare - and maybe unprecedented - prosecution of an advocacy group" for free speech-related conduct.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Bush administration's selective prosecution of Greenpeace is an unprecedented threat to civil liberties in America.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Jordan postponed ruling on Greenpeace's motion to dismiss
the indictment, but he warned the Justice Department that he might
grant the motion after the presentation of facts at trial. He
expressed doubts about the Justice Department's ability to prevail
against Greenpeace's claim that the criminal statute involved is
unfairly vague. "It is not a good sign," he wrote, "when the
government resorts to defining a phrase by repeating the phrase
itself."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Jordan granted a jury as a matter of discretion, citing
the unusual nature of the prosecution. "This case," he wrote, "may
... signal a change in DOJ [Justice Department] policy." He also
noted, "The prosecution has generated charges that the indictment
of Greenpeace is politically motivated due to the organization's
criticism of President Bush's environmental policies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, said,
"We look forward to proving at trial that we are not guilty of the
charges and that we were doing the right thing to protect the
Amazon."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The unprecedented nature of this prosecution has the potential
to transform an important aspect of our nation's legal and
political life, significantly affecting our tradition of civil
protest. The conduct for which the Ashcroft Justice Department
seeks to prosecute Greenpeace was, essentially, whistle-blowing --
publicly exposing and preventing violations of U.S. law prohibiting
the importation of illegally harvested mahogany wood. The Justice
Department's prosecution of Greenpeace is unwarranted and
politically motivated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still pending before Judge Jordan is Greenpeace's motion to
obtain information on whether the Government is engaged in improper
selective prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, two Greenpeace activists climbed onto a
commercial ship off the Florida coast with a banner that read,
"President Bush, Stop Illegal Logging." The ship was carrying
mahogany wood illegally exported from Brazil's Amazon rainforest.
The individuals involved in the protest were charged in 2002.
However, rather than prosecuting the importers of the illegal
mahogany, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against
Greenpeace itself in July 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous leaders, legal scholars and groups have publicly
criticized the prosecution; they include former Vice President
Gore, Senator Patrick Leahy, Julian Bond and the NAACP, the ACLU of
Florida, People for the American Way, the Sierra Club, the National
Resources Defense Council, the Miami Herald, the San Francisco
Chronicle and the Denver Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The extraordinary effort made to find and use this obscure law
strongly suggests a campaign of selective prosecution - the

	Following the controversial UK government approval of genetically engineered (GE) maize for commercial planting, the only company authorized to grow GE maize has withdrawn its application.  It now appears unlikely the UK will see any commercialised GE crops before 2008.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We protested against GE maize in 1999 - 5 years later Bayer withdraws the crop from the UK.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayer CropScience, a German company authorised to plant an
herbicide-resistant variety of maize known as Chardon LL, said
regulations on how and where the crop could be planted would make
it "economically non-viable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Action against maize trial in 1999" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="41905"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Chardon
LL was the variety of maize that 28 Greenpeace volunteers uprooted
in Norfolk in 1999 when the crop was undergoing field trials. The
activists were acquitted of charges of criminal damage when the
court agreed they were acting in the interest of protecting the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah North of Greenpeace UK says that "Anyone who cares about
the British countryside will be delighted by this announcement. The
only GE crop with a government green light now doesn't even have
the support of its manufacturer. Tony Blair bent over backwards to
get this crop grown, but Bayer knew its maize would fail in the
field. Without the help of a powerful chemical herbicide recently
banned in Europe, Britain's first GE crop would have been a flop.
That's why it's been abandoned."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE Maize was the last great hope of the GE industry to invade
Britain. The UK government has already turned down requests to
commercially plant GE rapeseed (canola) and beets. With Bayer's
retreat, the anti-GE forces have won a significant victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the world's most powerful companies and one of the
world's most powerful governments have remained steadfastly
determined to get GE crops grown commercially in the UK, despite
massive public resistance campaigns which have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removed GE from all human foods sold in the UK&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;removed GE from nearly all poultry and pig feed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;reduced the number of GE field trials from over 300 locations
per year to currently zero&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;caused Monsanto to leave the UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is a great victory for the thousands and thousands of people
who have taken online action, shopped selectively to avoid GE
products, spent cold nights pulling up crops, long weekends talking
to shoppers and farmers, and years of emotional and intellectual
energy countering the bullying, lobbying power and financial clout
of the gene giants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Clown steps down</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ronald-mcdonald-resigns/</url><text>
	Ronald McDonald entered the Queen Street branch of McDonald's in Auckland, New Zealand, today and handed in his resignation. The dramatic action was taken by the infamous fast food clown in protest at McDonalds' use of chicken fed on genetically engineered (GE) soy meal.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ronald McDonald quits in protest when he learns that his hens are fed on GE chicken feed
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm so upset to learn that stores named after me are using
GE-fed chicken," said Ronald. The iconic red and yellow character
was encouraging McDonalds' customers to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/campaigns/ge/mcge.asp"&gt;send
messages demanding that the fast food chain stop using GE chicken
feed&lt;/a&gt; and commit to a non-GE poultry, egg and ingredient
supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr McDonald was accompanied by a flock of indignant chickens
wearing bibs with the message "Say NO to McGE - GE fed chicken."
The poultry protesters handed out mock 'happy meal' packs with
crayons, stickers and colour-in postcards for customers to send to
the fast food giant demanding they make the shift to non-GE
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Steve Abel commended Ronald's protest
actions. "It seems like a bit of fun but it's actually a serious
issue," said Abel. Imported GE soy feed is the biggest source of GE
contamination in the New Zealand food chain." McDonald's chicken is
supplied by Australian poultry giant Inghams who bring in around
50,000 tonnes of GE contaminated soy annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"McDonald's and Inghams should stop using GE ingredients and
feed, out of a commitment to customer preference, concerns about
potential health impacts and for the good of the environment," said
Abel. Independent research found that 75 percent of consumers
wanted chickens that had not been fed GE soy meal. Tegel, New
Zealand's largest poultry company, have an active non-GE feed
policy and import certified non-GE feed from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingham claim that their next shipment of soy meal into New
Zealand, due in June, is non-GE soy from Brazil. However, according
to Ingham, the shipment is not certified as non-GE so it could be
significantly GE contaminated. Inghams also have no commitment to
sourcing non-GE soy now or in the future. This unverified shipment
cannot legitimately be used to claim a non-GE policy by Inghams or
McDonald's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"GE soy production in the US and Argentina has led to increased
chemical use, lower yields, herbicide resistant weeds and
contamination of conventional crops." McDonald's already has a
Europe-wide policy of excluding GE in food and poultry feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronald's iconic smile was twisted with disillusionment as he
handed in his resignation to management. "I'm not clowning around"
he stated in the brief message scrawled on blue paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenpeace in global GE blitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Greenpeace has launched global oppostion to GE
products by land, sea, and supermarket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bilbao, Spain:&lt;/b&gt; On April 20th, Greenpeace volunteers and
activists in Spain occupied the soya processing facilities of
Moyresa/Bunge in Cartagena to highlight the importation of an
estimated 4 millions tons of GE soya into Spain. On April 21st,
Moyresa/Bunge has announced that it is going to convert its

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Porto Allegre, Brazil:&lt;/b&gt; Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/ge/archives/001236.html#001236"&gt;"Biosafety
Patrol"&lt;/a&gt; exposes shippers of GE "caught in the act" of violating
the Brazilian legislation and international laws the ship Saturn V
is boarded and inspected by a team of Greenpeace volunteers. The
ship was loading GE soy with no documentation, in violation of the
Cartagena convention which stipulates that no GE products can be
transported without documentation identifying them as GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;European Union:&lt;/b&gt; New labelling laws went into effect on
Sunday which mandate that agricultural products for human
consumption containing GE be identified as such. Greenpeace has
launched &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/ge/action.html"&gt;"Trolley
Watch"&lt;/a&gt; to help consumers identify and expose GE products in
their own supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

	The United Nations´ International Maritime Organisation (IMO) decided today to designate the Baltic sea as a "Particularly Sensitive Sea Area," a decision which Greenpeace has been pushing for years.  The IMO regulates shipping worldwide, and has drawn strong criticism in the past for siding with industry at the expense of the environment.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace has campaigned for years against unsafe shipping in the Baltic, such as this single-hulled tanker.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision opens the way for a stringent environmental control
of international shipping in the Baltic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic Sea protection status was adopted despite stiff
opposition by the Russian Federation, which formed an alliance with
Liberia and Panama, the two largest flags of convenience states.
Flags of convenience states profit from allowing dirty industries
and unsafe oil tankers to travel the oceans practically
unregulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activist Dima Litvinov was rejoicing in the decision:
"This represents two and a half years worth of work by LOTS of
people, including two of the Rainbow Warrior crew who were locked
up in a Swedish cell for two weeks; groups of volunteers who spent
ages in 3-hour-on 3-hour-off watches around the clock tracking
dirty ships on their way into the Baltic; activists driving
flat-bottom rigid inflatable boats through the icy waters of
Estonian and Latvian oil ports in winter to stop a single hulled
tanker from docking. And in the end, we won."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As a citizen of a country bordering the Baltic, I find it
encouraging to see the vast majority of Baltic States working
together to protect our sea, but I am deeply concerned to see
Russia opposing environmental protection," said Sari Tolvanen of
Greenpeace. "Unless everyone around the Baltic pays attention, the
Russian oil industry is going to jeopardize our future," she
warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolvanen said that the United Nations agency decision was
motivated by the anticipated massive increase in shipping due to
Russia´s plans to further expand the export of oil through the
Baltic Sea passage. Whilst she welcomed the precautionary approach
of the rest of the Baltic states, Tolvanen said that much work
remains before the Baltic is truly protected. "Countries now have a
big job to do, making sure that the framework is filled by a full
set of appropriate specific measures."&lt;/p&gt;

	The government of India has finally bowed to pressure and agreed to allow a US Court to possibly rule that Dow Chemical should clean up the site of the ongoing Bhopal disaster. Mounting pressure from three determined hunger strikers, intensive lobbying by us, other Bhopal groups and thousands of online activists helped turn round the position of the Indian government.

            Union Carbide accident survivor's weekly meeting, Bhopal, India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This statement brings us one step closer to a historic order by the US Court directing Union Carbide (now owned by Dow) to clean up the toxic contamination in and around the factory premises in Bhopal," said Satinath Sarangi, Bhopal activist and one of those on hunger strike. "Such an Order will not only uphold the 'Polluter Pays' principle, but will set a precedence to hold multinational companies accountable in their home country for their actions abroad."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 people have been affected by the serious contamination emanating from the tonnes of toxic chemicals and chemical waste dumped in and around the Union Carbide factory premises. They, and their supporters from around the world, now expect the US District Court to order Union Carbide to clean up the contamination at Bhopal to the best global standards possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that the Prime Minister who intervened in this matter will show the same kind of sensitivity and alacrity in dealing with other pending issues in Bhopal and in holding Union Carbide's new owner Dow Chemicals liable for the pending issues in Bhopal," said Rasheeda Bi, winner of the Goldman Prize 2004, who has also been on hunger strike since June 18th along with Mr Shahid Noor, who was orphaned by the gas leak in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people also urged action from the Indian government from our online action, thank you to everyone who took part in this and other actions. Hundreds of Bhopal supporters, who have also been on hunger strike in solidarity with the three activists fasting in Dehli, celebrated the good news by breaking their fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The worst chemical disaster ever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bhopal disaster in 1984 is the world's worst chemical disaster ever. Toxic gas leaked from the poorly maintained and understaffed plant owned by Union Carbide. With safety systems either malfunctioning or turned off, an area of 40 square km, with a resident population of over half a million, was soon covered with a dense cloud of MIC gas. People woke in their homes to fits of coughing, their lungs filling with fluid. During the first three days after the accident, over 8,000 people died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the disaster, over 20,000 people have died from exposure-related illnesses, and of the approximately 520,000 people exposed to the poisonous gases, an estimated 120,000 remain chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors have never received adequate compensation for their debilitating illnesses and even almost 20 years after the disaster, the polluted site of the abandoned factory, bleeds poisons daily into the groundwater of local residents. Bhopal is an ongoing disaster and Union Carbide's new owners, Dow Chemical, should pay to clean up the toxic mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;New Hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 17 the US Court of Appeal, in a class action suit initiated by survivors' organizations and individual survivors of Bhopal, said that Union Carbide may be directed to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation "in the event that the Indian government or the State of Madhya Pradesh seeks to intervene in the action or otherwise urges the court to order such relief."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Indian government has urged the court to order the clean up we hope that the court takes the right decision and makes the polluter pay.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Bush administration has trashed US clean air laws by allowing power stations to install new equipment without adding pollution controls, and permitting coal-fired power plants to continue to release tons of mercury. This dirty energy also wreaks havoc on the environment, causing global warming, acid rain, and smog. That's why our activists are 700ft up a chimney in Pennsylvania to call for clean energy now!
&lt;div&gt;

            Activists climb a 700-ft coal plant smokestack to denounce Bush's dirty power plan. The Hatfield's Ferry Power Station is a symbol and an example of the Bush administration's dirty energy policy that favors polluting fossil fuels over clean energy sources.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists from Greenpeace USA have scaled the coal plant
smokestack at Hatfield's Ferry Power Station this morning to
denounce Bush's dirty power plan. Hatfield's Ferry Power Station in
Masontown, Pennsylvania was under investigation by the Justice
Department for violating the Clean Air Act - an investigation that
was dropped by the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua is one of the activists who scaled the stack: "President
Bush allows dirty power plants like Hatsfield Ferry to continue to
spew out poison, which pollutes our bodies, our water and air. We
need a commitment to clean energy like solar and wind to provide us
with safe and secure energy for the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Arial view of the banner on smokestack" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="62163"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"This
smokestack is a symbol of President Bush's dirty energy plan," said
Terri Swearingen, a long time environmental activist and registered
nurse. "As a mother whose daughter attends college and lives less
than 15 miles from here, I am outraged that President Bush has
blocked efforts to clean up this plant and others like it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hatsfield Ferry is an exceedingly dirty coal-burning power
plant. Owned by Allegheny Energy, this plant ranks as one of the
worst polluters in the country, violating environmental standards
and causing numerous health problems including premature death.
However, thanks to extensive Republican Party contributions, this
plant is permitted to continue on its dirty energy path without
consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

	They already had the opinion of thousands of scientists and a coalition of environment and wildlife groups. Then we gave them a petition signed by over 6000 cyberactivists.  If that wasn't enough, the Rainbow Warrior documented actual hard evidence of the destruction of protected species in the Tasman Sea and beamed it all the way to New York.  But still, the UN has this week failed to seize a crucial opportunity to halt high-seas bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unwanted bycatch, including a starfish, far outweighs the target catch of orange roughy in a deep sea trawl from international waters in the Tasman Sea. Greenpeace  along with more than a thousand scientists are supporting the call for a moratorium  on high seas bottom trawling, because of the vast amount of marine life that is destroyed by this fishing method.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had a real opportunity to act and they failed," said Karen
Sack of Greenpeace. "We need immediate action to save the deep sea
from being bulldozed by fishing vessels from a handful of
countries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several delegations blocked moves to prohibit high seas bottom
trawling - the world's most destructive fishing practice - under
pressure from fisheries ministries in their countries. Iceland and
Japan were particularly vocal in opposition. The measure was
replaced with a weak recommendation that nations "consider" an
interim prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions were all taking place at this week's UN
meeting in New York which had the power to recommend an immediate
halt on bottom trawling to the UN General Assembly. Greenpeace
members were out in force distributing footage from the Rainbow
Warrior showing the devastating effects of bottom trawling and
ensuring that the opinions of our cyberactivists were visible even
in the corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all bad though - governments from virtually every
region of the world expressed support for a prohibition on bottom
trawling. Particularly strong calls for action to halt bottom
trawling were made by Norway, Thailand, Costa Rica, the Republic of
Palau, and Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the last you've heard on bottom trawling,
we will be continuing our defence of the millions of rare,
protected and undiscovered species in the deep sea, so stay tuned
...&lt;/p&gt;

	Unilever, Coca Cola and McDonalds have promised to phase out climate-killing chemicals in their refrigeration equipment. This announcement shows that refrigeration can be climate friendly. However other corporations and governments continue to promote or lobby for increased use of climate-wrecking gases.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Production of more environmentally friendly Greenfreeze refrigerators in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced the
banning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration industry
switched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While this stopped depletion
of the ozone layer, it meant introducing a new potent greenhouse
gas. It was an environmental case of "out of the frying pan into
the fire."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch and show how it should
be done we launched the concept of Greenfreeze in 1992. We met two
scientists who pointed out how to avoid HFC's altogether. We found
an old fridge factory, appealed to our supporters to pre-order
enough units to finance a refit, helped build the market and
Greenfreeze was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
and fuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never work and the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in the industry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there are over 100 million Greenfreeze refrigerators in
the world, produced by all the major European, Chinese, Japanese
and Indian manufacturers. It is now available in most major markets
with the exception of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in the
domestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued to use refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to the Sydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such as Unilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors,
to live up to the guidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after being faced with a &lt;a href="http://www.cokespotlight.org/"&gt;concerted internet campaign&lt;/a&gt;
before the 2000 Olympics to buy green refrigeration for new units.
Before the start of the games all three companies announced phase
out plans for damaging refrigeration technologies by the time of
the 2004 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these companies have announced more concrete plans for how
to phase out HFC's. Our Executive Director, Gerd Leipold welcomed
the announcement: "Greenpeace welcomes the commitments made by
Unilever, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. We call on their competitors,
such as Nestle, Pepsi and Burger King, to follow suit. But
corporate action is only half the picture. For a complete solution,
governments must act. Politicians can't sit back and wait for the
market to deliver, because on its own, it won't."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Under attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this good news the trend is looking bleak. Left
unchecked, by 2050 HFC's will do as much damage to the climate as
the traffic fumes of all the world's passenger cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To force all companies and industry to meet the high standards
of these three companies effective government regulation is the
only solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly even the current ineffective regulation of HFC's is
under attack. American industry is leading the charge for wider use
of HFC's in uses such as car air conditioners. Ford motor company
is one example of a pro-HFC's corporation. Like the US chemicals
industries meddling in new European Union chemical law, the
"European" industry lobby group for HFC's was actually set up in US
state of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The way ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies like McDonalds, Unilever and Coca Cola, who are far
from 'all round environmental angels', can go HFC free then there
is no reason why their competitors cannot follow their lead. It
also exposes the lies and misinformation spread by irresponsible
industry lobbying. Goverments should follow the progressive stance
of these three companies and adopt an immediate phase-out of
HFCs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording was blasted into the conference at the Hilton
Hotel, which is being attended by the world's top food executives.
The recording was in over 20 languages so our friends at the top
can have no excuses about misunderstanding the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive the point home our activists also abseiled down from
the Hilton roof with banners reading 'GE Food is bad business'
while others representing the 25 EU nations were outside the summit
carrying the message, 'Listen to consumers: No to GMOs in our food,
feed and fields'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of interested delegates came out to see what the action
was about, however our activists noticed that they had covered up
their identity badges. Whether the delegates did this because they
didn't want their company to be associated with such an activity is
unclear. One thing is for sure though transparency with regard to
GE is not part of their corporate language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just in Europe that consumers don't want to eat GE,
recent Deloitte research on US consumer attitudes found that 67
percent of US consumers are concerned about eating GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Poll after poll has shown that a majority of consumers prefer
GE-free food, and an even bigger majority of consumers want GE food
to at least be labelled, including in China and the US," commented
Federica Ferrario of Greenpeace Italy. 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Activists hand a banner off the Hilton in Rome" title="Activists hand a banner off the Hilton in Rome" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="61869"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we never see is consumers demanding GE food, begging the
million dollar question: how come the global food industry isn't
doing more to make sure supply meets demand rather than force
feeding GE food to consumers?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global food industry often acts as a barrier to the
introduction of GE labelling legislation by claiming that sourcing
non-GE ingredients is next to impossible or that GE labelling is
unfeasible or prohibitively expensive. These claims are totally
inaccurate and misleading to consumers. They only serve to hide the
fact that non-GE ingredients are, or can be, plentiful and that GE
labelling, far from being impossible, has been implemented in
Europe for years and has not resulted in any consumer-end price
increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government, while attacking European GE labelling and
safety legislation via the WTO, is denying its own citizens the
basic right to know when GE ingredients are used in their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy is supported by the main food trade association and
its members, many of whom are present at the Rome meeting. They
insist on being dishonest about the realities of GE labelling and
sourcing non-GE ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"US and Canadian companies along with their trade associations
should stop deliberately obstructing the introduction of GE
labelling legislation in North America. What are they scared of? Do
they believe that consumers in the U.S. will reject GE food in the
same way European consumers are showing today, if they are given
the choice?" said our international GE campaigner Lindsay
Keenan.&lt;/p&gt;

	Tourists got more than they bargained for this morning when they turned up at Spanish architect Gaudi's landmark cathedral, Sagrada Familia, in Barcelona. Greenpeace activists, clinging to the famous spires like orange-clad gargoyles, had added a splash of colour that even Gaudi hadn't imagined by hanging large banners saying "SOS" and "Save Our Seas" in a bid to catch the attention of the UN Environment meeting happening just down the road.

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25 activists from the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and
Belgium were out in force in Barcelona this morning. Some scaled
the menacing Sagrada Familia cathedral towers (despite a slightly
hair-raising wind) to hang banners and others wearing "SOS"
t-shirts handed out information on deep-sea bottom trawling to
tourists below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Politicans and officials are meeting down the road to discuss
our oceans for World Environment Day on June 5th, but we want real
action, not just more talk," said Kate Nustedt, Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want a real outcome. We want a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Environment Day has an Oceans theme this year, and next
week there is also an important UN Oceans meeting in New York. So
if you think you've noticed a bit of a pattern recently you're not
wrong - we are ramping up our Oceans campaign, and the net is
tightening around irresponsible fishing companies and governments.
Earlier in the week &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=485016"&gt;
the Rainbow Warrior left New Zealand on a deep sea mission&lt;/a&gt;,
activists in New Zealand had a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;roughing-up
courtesy of the Orange Roughy Management Company&lt;/a&gt;, the Icelandic
government announced that it is &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=486962"&gt;
scaling down its "scientific" whaling&lt;/a&gt; due to "domestic
pressure" and today ... the launch of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;brand spanking new
Oceans site: Save Our Seas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;Save our
Seas&lt;/a&gt; features an interactive map and fascinating facts - get to
know the delightful snot eel which eats its dinner from the inside
out, find out why 100 million sharks are killed each year and why
tainted seafood costs US$7.2 billion a year. A key focus on the
site is also the fascinating and largely undiscovered deep sea
world which is currently under threat from bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="/international/PageFiles/25935/map.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we will be presenting over 4700 names of
cyberactivists from around the globe to the UN Consultative Process
in New York which can help us secure a moratorium on the most
destructive fishing process in our ocean today - bottom
trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone recognises that our oceans are in crisis. We can't
continue to exploit them in this way, " said Carmen Gravatt,
Greenpeace oceans campaigner, speaking from the Rainbow Warrior.
'The deep seas are the last great unknown spaces on earth. We're
running out of time - we don't want another round of UN talking
shops. We want real commitments and real action to save our
seas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=1400&amp;amp;sk=std"&gt;Tell the
UN what you think of bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Control your chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/the-chemical-house-2/</url><text>
	If you don't want to buy products containing toxic chemicals, how do you avoid them? Can you assume companies don't put toxic chemicals in their products? Unfortunately many large companies would rather keep secrets than inform consumers. Can you check the label? Nope, little or no information there. Can you rely on current laws and regulations? Bad luck - there's currently little protection on offer. So what can you do?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/greenpeace-s-chemical-house-da.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/5/greenpeace-s-chemical-house-da.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace's Chemical House database helps consumers select less toxic alternatives
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reckon that if you want something done right, you have to do
it yourself. That's why we are producing "red and green" lists of
consumer products based on their toxic content, the amount of
information the company is willing to provide, and how much the
company is prepared to do to remedy the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Make a new non-toxic shopping list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our "red and green" list covers products sold in Europe and by
many global multinational companies. When you go out shopping you
can now go armed with the information you need to make informed
choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Browse &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/chemicalhouse.cfm"&gt;the Chemical House&lt;/a&gt; and find out what exactly is lurking in your home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised at how many products you use each and
every day contain dangerous chemicals. But now you can use consumer
power to pressure companies into cleaning up their act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We ... want to encourage manufacturers to step up their efforts
to phase out hazardous substances and give consumers a wider choice
of greener products," says Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International
toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exposing the companies that use hazardous chemicals, and
showing which of their competitors are making efforts to eliminate
or replace these nasties, we aim to inform consumers about the true
contents of products. In April, we released the results of
laboratory tests conducted on Disney children's wear, which found
harmful substances present in some Disney pyjamas, T-shirts and
underwear. Despite global pressure on Disney, they have not
responded with a policy to phase out harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Mickey on the dock in Brussels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60024"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, Greenpeace's very own toxic Mickey Mouse, redubbed
"CheMickey", appeared in Brussels to await his fate. He's been
locked in the stocks and put on trial outside the European Union
Competitiveness Council where EU ministers are meeting to discuss
the proposed reform of Europe's chemicals policy (REACH). Chemickey
will be straddling one barrel containing consumer products known to
contain harmful chemicals, and another containing non-toxic safer
alternatives. The decision on whether CheMickey will be released
from his toxic burden lies in the hands of Industry and Economy
Ministers, represented by the characters of Chirac, Blair and
Schröder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="60054"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on companies by Greenpeace to substitute hazardous
chemicals is already bearing (organic) fruit. Last week, UK
retailer the Co-op announced that it was banning a range of toxic
chemicals still permitted for use in everyday products like
washing-up liquid and household cleaners, as part of a new ethical
drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What you can do right now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/index.cfm"&gt;Take
a tour of the Chemical Home and update your shopping list with
toxic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1366&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;Tell
Disney to stop using toxic chemicals in its childrenswear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org/"&gt;Tell your local MP to
strengthen chemical legislation (in Europe)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	LATEST UPDATE: UN fails to protect deep seasUnited Nations delegates are standing on the brink of rejecting an opportunity to protect high seas biodiversity.  At the same time, the Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow Warrior has discovered hard evidence of the indiscriminate destruction happening right now - including rare and protected species.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace activist on the Rainbow Warrior holds a ghost shark recovered during the day from bycatch discarded by the deep sea trawler Chang Xing in international waters in the Tasman Sea. Greenpeace  along with more than a thousand scientists are supporting the call for a moratorium  on high seas bottom trawling, because of the vast amount of marine life that is destroyed by this fishing method.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, black coral, which has had Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) protection since
1981, was dragged up from the floor of the Tasman Sea by one of the
several bottom-trawling vessels being tracked by Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other species were also suffering cruel, wasteful and
unnecesssary deaths, some of which were rarely sighted creatures
including deep sea sharks and squid, and others which were
commercially valuable fish species left to die because they were
not the intended catch for this trawler. The Rainbow Warrior crew,
including a marine biologist, have documented the destruction in
their recent mission in the high seas off the coast of New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet further evidence that an immediate moratorium on
high seas bottom trawling is needed to protect the unique
biodiversity of the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;

stance the company has taken in Europe which urges its chicken
suppliers to source non genetically engineered (GE) soya feed, and
we understand that is due to happen for the immediate future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inghams (which supplies McDonald's its poultry) has stated to
McDonald's that their next two shipments of soya meal into New
Zealand are to be sourced from a non-GE contaminated region of
Brazil. We will be keeping a close eye on these shipments and
seeking independent testing of the soy to demonstrate its non-GE
purity. And we will continue to campaign for an ongoing commitment
from Inghams to source non-GE feed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in New Zealand undertook a four-week public campaign
which targeted McDonald's stores throughout the country with
chicken-suited activists and a Ronald McDonald look-alike who
staged a mock resignation. The clown was later arrested for
blockading the 'golden arch' gates of McDonald's Wiri Distribution
Centre. The campaign urged McDonald's to take a position on GE
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the campaign has been humorous and good-natured, the
issue itself is a serious environmental one," says Abel. "GE crops
have led to an increase in herbicide use, lower yields, weed
problems and contamination of conventional and organic crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/ronaldarrest3.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;McDonald's has
already been proactive in sourcing non-GE derived ingredients for
their products over the last three years. "We commend McDonald's
for its efforts to date in ensuring the food ingredients it serves
are non-GE derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for McDonald's to request that its chicken supplier
seek a non-GE feed supply is more good news for both the
environment and for the public's GE-free food preference.
McDonald's has listened and responded positively to Greenpeace and
the public," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams however is not prepared to make a public statement and
will continue to import GE contaminated soya to Australia due to
claimed difficulties with the Brazilian port where the non- GE soya
is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/RonaldGE.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;"Inghams won't
commit to sourcing non-GE soya for the longer term but it has told
McDonald's that its next two shipments to New Zealand are non-GE,
which is a good start. However we will certainly keep up the
pressure for Inghams to commit to an ongoing and trans-Tasman
non-GE soya supply," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's largest poultry producer, Tegel, has been sourcing
a high standard Identity Preserved (IP) supply of non-GE soya from
the US since 2001. This comes at a premium of up to US$30 dollars
per tonne. Inghams is apparently not prepared to pay this premium
for the non-GE US supply so has sought less costly, non-GE
Brazilian soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/ge/kit.html"&gt;Trolley
Watch&lt;/a&gt; and keep GE food out of the supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

	All the kings horses and all the kings men failed to reach agreement on reducing nuclear arms at the conclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in New York.  Now it's up to you and me.

            Greenpeace volunteers project peace messages on to the bow of the USS Blue Ridge, command ship of the US 7th Fleet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments attending the four week conference have failed to
seizethe opportunity of reducing the nuclear threat,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;putting their ownnuclear self-interests before the desire for disarmament&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;," saidGreenpeace International's Disarmament specialist William
Peden at theconference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/5/proliferation-race.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This meeting needed to strengthen the treaty and send a strong
signalon disarmament and on proliferation of nuclear weapons,"
Peden said."It has failed to do that and as a result the world is a
far moredangerous place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectre of nuclear weapons in North Korea and Israel,
USintransigence on disarmament and its imminent threat of a return
tonuclear testing, controversy over Iran, and concerns over
nuclearweapons usable plutonium production programs in Japan and
othercountries reprocessing all played a part in the collective
failure ofthe conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;“The conference gridlock only emphasises the need to bolster thedisarmament side of the process,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peden said. "Unless and until we getrid of all nuclear weapons,
other countries are going to want them -and that's the destructive
dynamic we are witnessing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's next? Heads of state attending the UN Millennium
ReviewSummit in September need to act on the challenge laid down by
UNSecretary General Kofi Annan, in his opening speech to the
conference,to take disarmament seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal by  German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;removeUS nuclear weapons from Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;was a major positive to emerge fromthe conference, and we think
all European countries that host USnuclear weapons should follow
suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Turkey, which has 90 nuclear weapons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.  Borderingon Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Russia, the nuclear
weapons there pose a realrisk to regional security, and ought to be
removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;  72 percent of theTurkish people want Turkey to be nuclear-free&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. Why not &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a
note tothe Prime Minister asking him to follow the will of his
people&lt;/a&gt;? We've written the letter for you, all you need to do is
fill in yourname and address and click send.  And with the push of

<item><language>en</language><title>Goodbye to climate-killing Coke machines in Japan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coke-machines-japan/</url><text>
	Coke is replacing nearly a million vending machines in Japan with units that won't use climate-damaging chemicals for refrigeration.  If Coke can do it in Japan, there's no excuse for any company in any country to be chilling their beverage at the cost of warming the globe.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/copy-of-e-card-used-by-the-cok.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/copy-of-e-card-used-by-the-cok.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Image from an E-card, part of the Cokespotlight campaign, which successfully changed Coke's policy on climate-killing refrigerants.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke isn't taking this action out of the goodness of their heart.  It took consumer pressure and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;creative lobbying by Greenpeace, Adbusters&lt;/span&gt;, and other groups to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to their credit, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coke responded energetically &lt;/span&gt;to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, our online activists took on Coca-cola for using climate-killing chemicals in the refrigeration units they were sending to the "Green" Olympics.  A &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;barrage of e-cards, e-mails, and stickers on Coke machines around the world secured a promise fromthe Coke CEO to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) &lt;/span&gt;-- a potentgreenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFCs were introduced in the late 1980s as an alternate to refrigeration using Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which were responsible for punching a hole in the protective ozone layer around the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greenpeace partnered with industry to create a technology called "Greenfreeze" which transformed the European industry&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola says that they and a collation of industry partners, including McDonald's and Unilever, have invested more than 30 million dollars to build climate-friendly vending machines. They estimate &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the switch will save 70,000 tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere by 2010&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of this victory is that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;action to save the climate is possible&lt;/span&gt;. If it can be done in one country it can be done everywhere else. If it can be done by one company, it can be done by all others. If it can be done in one industrial sector it can be done in all other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke's action is proof that companies can make the right choices for our world; and that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greenpeace's brand of online activism can help spur them to make those choices&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Testing Bayer</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/testing-bayer/</url><text>
	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have visited two of the major producers of toxic chemicals at
theirplants in Belgium to pressure them to produce safer chemicals
andsupport the inclusion of obligatory 'substitution principle' (EU
speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.

            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you

	The one international treaty dedicated to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons is deadlocked by the  unwillingness of those countries which already have nuclear weapons to let the treaty do its job.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace has joined with other groups in setting up citizens inspections of illegal nuclear weapons sites around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the treaty obligates the "official"
nuclearweapons states to pursue nuclear disarmament, a US State
Departmentofficial is quoted in the National Security Newswire as
stating "we donot accept this notion that the United States must
take steps to"devalue" nuclear weapons to be in compliance."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butcountries pursuing nuclear capability like Korea and possibly
Iran arenot going to "devalue" the quest for nuclear weapons in a
world inwhich being a nuclear power like the US means the ability
to conduct aunilateral, pre-emptive war fighting strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US declared Iraq in violation of international law
over anuclear weapons programme that didn't actually exist, &lt;b&gt;the
US, andthe other nuclear weapons states, UK, France, Russia, China,
Pakistan,India, and Israel are in violation of international law
with their ownvery real arsenals&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The International Court of Justice decided in 1998 that the
threat or use of nuclear weapons is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'stherefore up to all of us to enforce the law. Greenpeace has
partneredwith other peace organisations to begin a series of
"Citizens'Inspections" of nuclear weapons sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;France&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="144291" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;Accompanied by a flotilla of 35 yachts from the Brest area, the
Greenpeace ship &lt;b&gt;Arctic Sunrise entered the military exclusion
zone around the French Military Nuclear Base at L'Isle Longue&lt;/b&gt;
near Brest on Sunday, May 15th, after announcing our intention by
radio to conduct a citizens' inspection.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had information that two of the four French nuclear-armed
submarines wereat the base during the inspection (although of
course governmentofficials never confirm or deny this kind of
information), with a totalfire power of 1000 times the Hiroshima
bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the ArcticSunrise was stopped by two French military boats,
GP France CampaignDirector Yannick Jadot, accompanied by two of the
Arctic Sunrise Crew, Erkutand Craig, continued the citizens'
inspection by inflatable zodiac,finally being stopped by a boat
full of well-armed French commandos. Atthe same time, the citizens'
inspection was backed up by 150 Greenpeacesupporters and local
activists, as well as members of the ArcticSunrise crew, who
marched to the front entrance of the nuclear base,demonstrating
against the continued presence of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;"Wegot to within 100 meters of a
nuclear armed submarine" said YannickJadot "in an unarmed
inflatable raft.  Nuclear weapons cannot bemade secure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Belgium&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="122271" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;InApril
our activists joined with regular Bombspotting activists toinspect
three military facilities in Belgium, with the aim ofpressuring
NATO member states to renounce their nuclear weaponsarsenal.  The
inspections took place at Kleine Brogel Air basewhich houses
nuclear weapons, NATO's Brussels Headquarters and itsSHAPE military
headquarters in Mons/Bergen.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1000 activists showed up to carry out the inspection. 500
bombspotters were arrested.&lt;/b&gt; A massive police presence greeted
inspectors from Greenpeace and Bombspotting at NATO- HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Australia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/features/images/nu_citizens_inspection.jpg" align="left" height="105" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="140"&gt;Mayor Murray Matson led a Citizens Weapons Inspection
team of local dignataries and Greenpeace activists to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/features/features_details.html?site_id=45&amp;amp;news_id=1552"&gt;
Lucas Heights to check on secretive research into uranium
enrichment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wewere always told this was a medical research facility...
while thisstory was being told to us, all along there was another
type ofresearch going on, uranium enrichment, that is conducive to
producingnuclear weapons," said Dr Tilman Ruff, president-elect of
the MedicalAssociation for the Prevention of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Matson is a member of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/is-your-mayor-for-peace/"&gt;
Mayors for Peace,&lt;/a&gt; an initiative begun by the mayor of Hiroshima
to abolish nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Turkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="144096" mode="story"&gt;InTurkey
we've established a semi-permanent inspection facility about
50meters from the entrance to the Incirlik NATO Air Base near
Adana: thePeace Embassy.&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polling data in Turkey has shown that less thanhalf of the
population is aware that US nuclear weapons are actuallypresent in
their country, and 72% support Turkey being a nuclear freezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThisPeace Embassy is being established at a time when a report
beingdiscussed by the US Congress could result in additional US
nuclearweapons being stationed in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;These US nuclear weapons stationed in Turkey are a danger to regional &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;stability and global security&lt;/span&gt;",says Aslýhan Tümer,
our Nuclear Disarmament  campaigner in theMediterranean, "We're
bearing witness, and calling on Prime minister Erdogan to say no to
any US nuclear weapons in Turkey"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThePeace Embassy has created a weblog which they will maintain
throughouttheir presence.  As Ertank noted in one post: "Incirlik
is astrange town. The only means of economy is the Americans. There
is nosingle shop with a Turkish name here. They work for the
American troopsand their wives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Escalating pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, along with Bombspotting and othercitizen inspection
groups, will be escalating their pressure on thecountries owning
and hosting nuclear weapons as we move closer to the60th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Weare part of a growing network of people who will continue to conductthese inspections,"&lt;/span&gt;
said our campaigner Nicky Davies. "We're callingupon all our
supporters and activists to join in increasing thepressure on the
nuclear weapons states to abolish nuclear weapons."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help by &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;writing
today to the Prime Minister to ask that Turkey become
nuclear-free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Want to organise your own citizen's inspection of a nuclear weapons facility near you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out where nuclear weapons are stationed all over
the worldwith our Zoom on Doom map (below), and you can download
materials andfind out more from the &lt;a href="http://www.motherearth.org/inspection/index_en.php"&gt;Citizens'

	What happens to your mobile or computer when you throw it away? Did you know it could end up dumped in Asia and scrapped by hand in appalling conditions? This shouldn't be happening, so we are pressuring one of the biggest bad guys, Hewlett-Packard, to come clean -- by delivering a truckload of its own electronic waste to its doorstep.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A migrant child from Henan province holds up a piece of e-waste. It was once a Nokia computer screen, now dumped in China and dismantled by poor, unprotected, migrant workers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A Chinese child sits amongst a pile of wires and e-waste. Children can often be found dismantling e-waste containing many hazardous chemicals known to be potentially very damaging to children's health.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because our mobile phones, computers and other&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;electronic products aremade using toxic ingredients&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, workers at production sites are at riskof exposure and the
products cannot be recycled safely when they arediscarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are routinely, and often illegally, shipped as waste
fromEurope, US and Japan to Asia because it is cheaper and easier
to &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;dumpthe problem on poor countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that have low environmental standards than totackle it at
home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;inline_item mode="story" align="left" item_id="140141"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditionswhere electronic waste (e-waste) is scrapped in
southern China aretruly shocking. One of our scientists, Kevin
Brigden, who has visitedhis fair share of the world's toxic
hotspots, described the scene: "Theconditions in these yards are
horrific. In Guiyu, southeast China, I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;found acid baths leaching into streams&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. They were so acidic they coulddissolve a coin in just hours.
Many of the chemicals used inelectronics are dangerous and can
damage people even at very low levelsof exposure."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are conducting ongoing investigations intoscrap yards in
India and China, where we have found people &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;taking thee-waste apart by hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and being exposed to a nasty cocktail ofdangerous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take a trip through the electronics lifecycle to discover why it's a problem and what can be done about it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Hewlett-Packard?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;inline_item mode="story" item_id="144738"&gt;
&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking toxic chemicals out of products makes reuse and recycling
ofelectronic products safer, easier and cheaper. This is the first
stepin tackling the problem of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have asked all the top mobilephone and computer companies
worldwide to clean up their act. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Samsung,Sony, Sony Ericsson and Nokia have already taken a first step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bycommitting to eliminate toxic flame retardants and PVC plastic
fromsome of their products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Hewlett Packard has made no such committment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, nor haveApple, Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, IBM, LG, Motorola,
Panasonic, or Toshiba. At a major technology expo in Beijing
webuilt a statue using the companies' e-waste collected from scrap
yardsin China to demonstrate the problem these companies are
causing.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;inline_item mode="story" item_id="144746"&gt;
&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncetoxic chemicals have been eliminated from products,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;manufacturers shouldtake full life cycle responsibility &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for their products and, once theyreach the end of their useful
life, take their goods back for re-use,safe recycling or disposal.
This is what we are campaigning for: to turnback the toxic tide of
e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Our cyberactivists helped pressure Sony Ericsson to come clean.

<item><language>en</language><title>Who will win the Golden Chainsaw?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/golden-chainsaw/</url><text>
	The vote is on - who is responsible for the most Amazon destruction?  Last week the Brazilian government showed that deforestation was at record levels, so we have nominated Brazilian President Lula and 5 others for the notorious Golden Chainsaw title.  "It's a very difficult choice. All six are strong candidates," said Paulo Adario, Amazon campaign co-ordinator.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/the-golden-chainsaw.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Golden Chainsaw 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award has two prizes: public - to be decided by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;direct vote
on the internet&lt;/a&gt;- and environmental activists and journalists
will make a "critics' choice". The prizes will be given to the
Brazilianpersonality whose action or inaction were decisive in the
incrediblelevels of deforestation in the Amazon.   The
not-so-luckywinner, announced on June 6th, will receive a statue
made of illegallylogged wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nominees are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25682/the-golden-chainsaw-nominees.jpg" align="middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;    Blairo Maggi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor of the State of Mato Grosso, absolute champion
ofdeforestation. (The state was responsible for 48 percent of the
totalAmazon destructionduring 2003-04). Considered the "King of
Soya", he longs for thepresidency of Brazil.  Author of the
celebrated phrase, "Thisbusiness offorests does not have a
future".  And, if it depends on him, itcertainly won't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Roberto Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of Agriculture in Brasilia and soy farmer in Maranhão,
he isabsolutely convinced that agribusiness is the salvation of
farming. Refuses to recognise the relation between deforestationand
the advance of agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First minister in line of command in the Lula Government and
Chief ofthe Civil House. Co-ordinator of the "Plan of Action for
thePrevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazônia"
andgreatly responsible for the lack of  its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Luís Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President of the Republic of Brazil and ultimately responsible
for itsactions and inactions. Although he promotes a sustainable
model forthe Amazon, the protection of theenvironment in his
government until now is considered a mere obstacletoeconomic
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Antônio Palocci&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of the Treasury and holder of the key to thesafe. He
compliments  agribusiness and he applaudsincreases in exports while
the government institutions andagencies who protect the environment
receive less and less federal resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Simão Jatene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor of the State of Pará which has been historically the
vice-leader in deforestation, but the winner of the prizes in
thecategories: violence and murders in the field, slave labour,
illegaloccupation of land and activities of inherent mismanagement
in theprocess of deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Vote now!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.br/motosserra/?lang=en"&gt;Vote for the candidate you think deserves the Golden Chainsaw (note: this link takes you to the Brazilian site, and voting is in Portuguese, but don't worry, it's easy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give to save the Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_101"&gt;Donate now and help us to protect the Amazon from chainsaws, golden or otherwise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Bulldozers move in to flatten the land of a proposed Whale meat processing plant and scientific research centre. The Greenpeace "Whale Embassy" has been occupying the area and the activists are refusing to leave until the plans for the site are cancelled. The activists were ordered to vacate the land by 16th May 2005, but have refused to do so. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, delivered by representatives of the Jangsaengpo
Development Agency,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;accuses us of some bizarrethings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, such as threatening ladies' exercises and scaring teenagers,
but mainlyof&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;preventing an economic recovery by opposing the research centre (orwhalemeat factory) and whale (or whaling) museum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, whaling -especially "scientific" &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;whaling - cannot bring an economic recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.The research centre and whalemeat factory are not scientific
or"environmentally friendly".  The Korean government is
misleadingthe people of Jangsaengpo, risking their future and our
activists' safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angry mob that visited us yesterday are not representative
of all the viewsin the area. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Many of Ulsan's citizens have been visiting our embassy, drinkingtea with our activists, and even cooking meals for the team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and offering to washtheir clothes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many local children have visited the embassy and watchedvideos,
and even had &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/koreawhales/archives/2005/05/kids_day_at_the.html"&gt;
English lessons in the green dome&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, opinions in Ulsan are divided.  But there is a
senseof frustration at the government, and at Greenpeace and Korean
Federation forEnvironment Movement (KFEM) for supposedly
threatening their optimism of aneconomic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locals speak of the "good old days" ofwhaling and eating whale
meat.  However, the fact is that Korea's whalesare some of the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-activists-threatened/"&gt;
most endangered in the world&lt;/a&gt;, and the locals' hope seems to be
based on false promises and a nostalgicview of the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;outdated, unsustainable and internationally condemned practice ofcommercial whaling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean government, and the city of Ulsan, need to address
the concerns of theJangsaengpo community and ensure they are given
sustainable means ofredevelopment.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The local government should also ensure that our activistsare not threatened &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as they struggle to defend Korea's whales for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Jangsaengpo local people have suffered over the last twenty years
ofdecreasing economical conditions, but now they are expecting IWC
andgrand opening of whale museum, so we are so excited about our
economicrecovery and local trading stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Weare preparing facilitation, and making clear the streets and
publicarea to prepare for visit of guests from other countries. We
arepreparing our revival but Greenpeace, invited by KFEM, have set
up acamp on the site of the proposed whale center. They are
illegallyoccupying the place and they are trying to communicate
their message,but they are not listening to the local opinions of
local people.That's the reason why we make press conference to
exclaim our thoughtsabout Greenpeace occupying the place for
research center. &lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;[Greenpeace has been entirely open to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;talking with the local people, and sharing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;views.]&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Fromthe beginning Jangsaengpo people tried to block the entrance of
rainbowwarrior, and we prepared demonstrations on the water against
Greenpeacevisit. But since we are facing international event,
blocking Greenpeacewould be shameful, thats why we didn't do it. So
GP and KFEM didn'thave any conflict when they came in to
Jangsaengpo port, and they hadtheir event, and they then promised
to us that they will do their eventfrom 4th April-11th April, then
they said they would leave &lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;[The Rainbow Warrior left on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;the 12th April]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
But they set up a camp right beside the whale museum, which is
whaleresearching centre. They set up 10 tents and ran a campaign.
It's been50 days so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Since they occupied thisplace it has been a threat to ladies who
used to do exercise aroundthis are, and parents who have teenage
children cannot let themoutside. &lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;[This is an odd  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;observation, since people have continued to exercise on the adjacent vacant lot everyday, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;many local people, young and old, regularly come &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;to the Embassy]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25681/local-children-come-to-the-wha.jpg" height="300" width="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Moreoverthe company who is contracted to build the whale research
center istrying to make car park for oceans day, but GP and KFEM
still occupythis space illegally, so they are being an obstacle and
it touches thenerves of local people. &lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;[Oceans Day takes place on 31 May in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;Korea, and this is the day that the new museum &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;promoting whaling will be opened.] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
MoreoverGP and KFEM are still carrying out illegal occupation, but
citygovernment and MOMAF of Ulsan are not doing anything about it.
So itseems that the government doesn't care about Jangsaengpo local
people'sopinions; this makes Jangsaengpo people get more angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
SoJangsaengpo development association, Jangsaengpo senior
association,Jangsaengpo young adult association and Jangsaengpo
local people cannot put up with this situation, so we declare the
following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;We
ask to GP and KFEM, that the illegally-occupied camp that was set
up from April 5th is immediately withdrawn by GP and KFEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: courier new,courier,mono; font-size: 80%"&gt;
Weare asking the government of Ulsan and MOMAF of Ulsan to process
ourcomplaint using official power. We wish to make a complaint
about theillegal occupation by GP and KFEM to the government after
30th May at12pm. In case GP and KFEM do not leave by 6pm on the
26th May, andgovernment do not protect local area people's rights,
everything thathappens caused by this situation, will be the
responsibility of GP andKFEM city of Ulsan and MOMAF of Ulsan's
shoulders. &lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;[Greenpeace will happily vacate the site immediately, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;as has already been conveyed, upon assurances from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;land owner (MOMAF), and the City of Ulsan, that the whale &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"&gt;meat factory will not be built.] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We've set sail with the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) to explore one of the oldest and least understood habitats on Earth. Using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) - small, unmanned submarines - scientists onboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza will study, sample and document the fascinating underwater world off the coast of Scotland.

            SAMS Scientist Lyndsey Dodds with live coral sample from Mingulay Reef complex, Inner Hebrides Islands, UK. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition to the Mingulay reef, located in around 150m of
wateroff the west coast of Scotland, will provide vital scientific
data onone of the biggest cold-water coral reef complexes so far
discovered inUK waters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the expedition, which set off from Greenock, near
Glasgow, on 12May, scientists will also be looking for any evidence
of damage to thereef. Although the extent of any damage to the
Mingulay reef iscurrently unknown, coral habitats around the world
face many threats -particularly from destructive fishing practices
such as bottomtrawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/save-our-seas-2/save-deep-sea-life"&gt;
Bottom trawlers&lt;/a&gt; drag heavily weighted fishing nets across the
seabed -effectively steamrolling the ocean floor and smashing
everything in theway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="140629" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling is the number one threat to fragile cold-water
coralstructures, which provide habitats for a diverse range of
speciesincluding fish, sponges, starfish, sea urchins and
crustaceans. Lophelia reefs also serve as important fish spawning
and nurserygrounds. It takes one year for Lophelia to grow 2.5cm.
It takes justone typical fishing trip for a bottom trawler to sweep
approximately 33square kilometres of the seabed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling for a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling to
protect ocean life.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon destruction: six football fields a minute</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazon-destruction/</url><text>
	Amazon destruction has accelerated to record levels, according to figures released by the Brazilian government. The annual rate has reached 26,130 square km, the second highest ever - an area equivalent to about six football fields a minute are destroyed. Almost half of the deforestation occurred in the State of Mato Grosso, governed by the largest individual soy producer in the world, Blairo Maggi.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Illegal deforestation for soy production, in the North of State of Mato Grosso.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percent of Amazon loss occurred between May and
July 2004,when President Lula's Action Plan to Curb Deforestation
had alreadybeen adopted. The Plan, which was presented in March
2004, took sevenmonths of elaboration and had the participation of
13 Ministriescommitting resources, defining responsibilities and
setting atimetable. During the same period, Lula's Government has
celebrated therapid expansion in grain production and world
leadership in meatexports, with the Minister of Treasury Antonio
Palocci declaring,"Agribusiness is the best business of Brazil.
"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A national shame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulo Adario, our Amazon campaign coordinator, said, "Clearly
Lula'sadministration has failed up to now to implement the Action
Plan and toprotect the Amazon. Although there have been positive
measures taken bythe Government, such as the creation of protected
areas and demarcationof Indigenous lands, the fact that the annual
average of deforestationhas been more than 23,000 km2 for the last
three years is simplyunacceptable. This is a national shame."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The rape of the rainforest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 12,576 square kilometres lost in the State of Mato
Grosso, 4,176km2 were authorised by the government. The rest was
illegal. Maggidoesn't hide his opinion about deforestation: "A 40
percent increase indeforestation doesn't mean anything at all, and
I don't feel theslightest guilt over what we are doing here," Maggi
said in aninterview to The New York Times in September 2003,
referring to theAmazon deforestation rate of the previous year. 
Last week the UKnewspaper The Independent exposed Maggi as being
"the man behind ...the rape of the rainforest." But Maggi has
reacted angrily, "I canpersonally say that my company (Grupo
Amaggi) has carried out nodeforestation over the past few years. I
think they (the newspapers)were heavy handed and they exaggerated,"
he said. However, Maggi is thelargest soy producer in the world.
The soya boom is responsible formuch of the deforestation.  "It is
turning the rainforest intocattle feed. It is gross," said John
Sauven, head of the rainforestcampaign for Greenpeace UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Key culprits and solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Agribusiness and illegal logging are key culprits of
deforestation,"says Adario. "Lula's administration is facing a
fundamentalcontradiction: to fight Amazon deforestation or to
promote theexpansion of agribusiness to pay the Brazilian external
debt. To make areal difference on the ground, the Government needs
to restrict soyplantations only in areas already deforested, combat
illegal logging,continue to create protected areas and effectively
implement their ownanti-deforestation Plan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing this level of Amazon destruction, the Government is
alsocontributing to the devastating impacts of global warming.
Carbon dioxideemissions from deforestation and burning in the
Amazon are the mainBrazilian contributions to climate change and
there is growing evidencethat climate change is drying out the
forests, creating a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://prefs.greenpeace.org/user-register/signup?register_id=913335"&gt;Cyberactivists have pressured companies to go forest-friendly and ensured that the next Harry Potter book contains recycled paper.

	LATEST UPDATE: Greenpeace takes direct action against bottom trawlersThe needless, excessive destruction of the high seas was exposed after our activists beamed back disturbing footage of deep sea carnage on a European Union (EU) trawler.

            A team from the Greenpeace ship MV Esperanza documents catch being landed on board a Spanish flagged bottom-trawler, the Ivan Nores.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from our ship Esperanza, braving gales and stormy
weather, documented the destruction caused by a Spanish bottom
trawler, the Ivan Nores, in the North Atlantic near Ireland. Bottom
trawling is the most destructive fishing method happening today,
and we have the proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The footage from the Esperanza is stunning even to seasoned
marine biologists: copious amounts of "bycatch" destroyed by the
bottom trawling nets included huge red squid, rays, dogfish,
starfish and crustaceans. Fish caught included roundnose grenadier
and Baird's smoothead, both of which are extremely vulnerable to
fishing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

footage for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

at the UN in New York, diplomats are talking about the protection
of marine life in these international waters. A resolution on the
issue is up for discussion in early November. But we think that all
this talk is getting us nowhere. "Every day wasted just discussing
the need for action is possibly another deep sea habitat gone. The
UN must act to stop destructive fishing and save the giant squid
and thousands of other marine animals," said Maria Jose Caballero,
a campaigner on board the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="The Ivan Nores" title="Spanish bottom trawler the Ivan Nores" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="68418"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Bottom-trawling
boats, mainly from EU countries, drag fishing gear weighing several
tonnes across the sea bed, destroying everything in their path,
including marine wildlife such as coral, and devastating life on
underwater mountains - or 'seamounts'. Seamounts are usually in the
high seas (outside individual countries' economic zones) so these
boats are effectively stealing future resources from all of us with
absolutely no regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Something's fishy at the EU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and environmentalists are calling for an immediate
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. However it seems that the
EU is continuing to defy both science and logic by not only
blocking international progress towards protecting deep sea life,
but, as the Esperanza has undeniably pointed out, actively
participating in this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Damage control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a member of the &lt;a href="http://savethehighseas.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Deep Sea
Conservation Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, an international alliance of
organisations, representing millions of people in countries around
the world, which is calling for a moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling. Right now we are ratcheting up the pressure on UN
delegates, particularly from the EU, to ensure that this moratorium
happens - international media such as &lt;a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7c10677c-1e46-11d9-82ec-00000e2511c8.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; (subscribers only), &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65346,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1" target="_blank"&gt;Wired magazine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/weekend/2004/1016/1568984646WK16VINEY.html" target="_blank"&gt;Irish Times&lt;/a&gt; (subscribers only) have been
picking up the story as well as TV news from Australia to the

<item><language>en</language><title>One year on, UN takes up Greenpeace Iraq warnings</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/vanishing-nukes-in-iraq/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;IAEA has eye in the sky: Greenpeace had inspectors on the ground&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Mohamed ElBaradei warned the world today that nuclear assets in Iraq have been looted and nuclear materials have disappeared. Greenpeace made that warning more than a year ago when we located radioactive materials and returned them to the nuclear facility at Tuwaitha. Due to US resistance to the UN nuclear watchdog's return to Iraq, it has to rely on satellite images. We saw evidence of the UN concerns on the ground.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/looters-in-abandoned-hangar-at.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/10/looters-in-abandoned-hangar-at.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace documented looters in abandoned hangar at Tuwaitha nuclear centre in Iraq in June 2003.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When US troops rolled into Baghdad, they ensured that the oil
ministry was immediately under guard. In the south, oil pipelines
and wells were surrounded with armoured vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in Tuwaitha, where Saddam Hussein's nuclear research was
conducted, a site previously sealed by the UN International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and containing nuclear equipment and materials
had not a single soldier outside its door. Local residents took
what they could, including barrels to use for cooking and water
storage that they simply emptied of their uranium yellowcake
contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sent a mission to Iraq in June of 2003 to evaluate the extent
of contamination and to call for the US and the UN to take
immediate action to secure and clean up the site. We brought new
barrels for the local residents to swap for their contaminated
ones. We took measurements in people's homes, in one case finding
radiation levels 10,000 times above background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=614676&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
wrote to Kofi Annan in July 2003 about our concerns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=615959&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
submitted our findings to Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/reports/ex-summary?item_id=615965&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
ten-page report&lt;/a&gt; and video documentary in July of 2004, when the
US allowed a limited inspection of the site by the IAEA. Nuclear
expert John Large commented in the report that the evidence
presented by us suggested to him "that a considerable amount of
radioactive material and contamination has been removed from the
secure areas of the Tuwaitha Nuclear Centre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear disaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our letter to ElBaradei listed the materials we found, where we
found them, and stated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is seriously concerned that the looting of the
Tuwaitha facility had been so extensive by the time our team
arrived, that it will be virtually impossible for a team of
inspectors to reconstruct the radioactive inventory prior to the
invasion. And these concerns have been considerably exacerbated in
the last weeks following the revelation that the US has airlifted
considerable quantities of nuclear material from the area without
IAEA oversight."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear material from Iraq has been found in both the
Netherlands and Turkey, showing that nuclear material can and does
leave the country."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Contaminated school near Tuwaitha, Iraq" title="Contaminated school near Tuwaitha, Iraq" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="51172"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Unfortunately,
the contamination stays in Tuwaitha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Mike Townsley said at the time of our
inspection "If this had happened in the UK, the US or any other
country, the villages around Tuwaitha would be swarming with
radiation experts and decontamination teams. It would have been
branded a nuclear disaster site and the people given immediate
medical check-ups. The people of Iraq deserve no less from the
international community. That they are being ignored is a scandal
that must be rectified without delay."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has been done to date. And in their response to our
warning about vanishing inventories, the best the IAEA could say
was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Agency has offered the Iraqi authorities advice on the
safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material.
However, the Agency's assistance is based on requests, and, in line
with the Agency's confidentiality regime, the Agency can only
publish protected information with the consent of the concerned
State or States. Some of your enquiries and suggestions may
therefore more appropriately be directed to the Iraqi Interim
Government [...] At this stage, it is important that IAEA
inspectors return to Iraq..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interim government has also done nothing, the IAEA is still
banned from Iraq by American fiat, and the only winners in this
story are those who are looking to capitalise on security failures
by scoring loose nukes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What was it all for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="51497"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
invasion of Iraq was supposed to be about stopping weapons of mass
destruction. It was supposed to be about stopping nuclear materials
from getting out from under UN control. Was the failure to secure
Tuwaitha a result of incompetence, or evidence of the real priority
of securing Iraq's oil supply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the world is a more dangerous place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a would-be terrorist, the menu of options for securing
nuclear material is getting longer and longer. If you don't feel
like picking up some enriched Uranium to make a dirty bomb from
Iraq, you can find a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=422957"&gt;
lightly guarded truck in France containing Plutonium&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=593488"&gt;
shipload of weapons-grade material&lt;/a&gt; on the high seas from the
US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to ensure nuclear materials don't end up in the
wrong hands is for everyone to give them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need a satellite monitoring system to witness the
looting of nuclear materials and the disassembly of buildings in
Iraq. We videotaped the incidents mentioned in ElBaradei's report,
and you can see them yourself by clicking below:&lt;/p&gt;

	LATEST UPDATES: www.stop-plutonium.orgThanks to the Bush Administration's disregard for global concerns about nuclear proliferation, two ships carrying some 140kg of weapons-grade plutonium are en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Cherbourg in France.  The two lightly armed UK-flagged commercial nuclear ships are now somewhere off the coast of France, waiting until a possible injunction is served against Greenpeace, to dock.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists spend the night waiting for the imminent arrival of two BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) ships, which are carrying 140kg of radioactive weapons-grade plutonium. The Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal left the U.S. port of Charleston, SC on September 20th.  Greenpeace believes the shipment conducted by the US and France is unnecessarily threatening international security and putting the environment at risk.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US lacks a suitable nuclear facility for converting this
potential weapons material into experimental plutonium fuel (MOX) -
so the Bush Administration is allowing it to be shipped around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment began its journey at the US Department of Energy's
Los Alamos nuclear weapons facility in New Mexico, and covered
almost 2,500km before arriving in Charleston. The ships left North
Carolina and passed close to the Irish coast on their way to
Cherbourg. Once unloaded the shipment will cover up to 1200km of
roads before arriving at a closed plutonium fuel fabrication
facility in Cadarache, in the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, two workers were contaminated during a
nuclear accident involving plutonium at the Cadarache facility,
which is operated by the state-owned nuclear company Areva/Cogema.
As for the Los Alamos National Laboratory - operations there were
recently suspended after classified data 'went missing'.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="66833"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total journey for the plutonium shipment? A ridiculous
6589km!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the US and France, local groups have mounted strong
opposition to shipments, including the Nuclear-Free Atlantic
Flotilla and Citizens Against Plutonium. Greenpeace also has been
waiting patiently for the shipment to arrive and holding peaceful
protests however the local authorities have responded with a heavy
hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene Riguidel, one of France's most famous sailors, John
Castle of Guernsey and Pernilla Svenberg from Greenpeace
International were arrested for mounting a peaceful protest inside
the military port against the plutonium shipment. Although they
were released within 24 hours from the military arsenal in
Cherbourg, Greenpeace has been summoned to appear in the Cherbourg
Court to face a request by Areva, through its subsidiary Cogema,
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), for an injunction preventing
it from approaching within 300m of the two ships carrying plutonium
or within 100m of the Cherbourg harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment sends the strongest signal that the US holds
little regard for global efforts to keep nuclear weapons materials
out of commerce," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace International.
"It is the height of arrogance to conduct a shipment like this
while demanding other nations refrain from proliferating nuclear
weapons materials and technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Charleston, Citizens Against Plutonium (CAP) was formed in
response to the nuclear shipment, and to the refusal of the US
Department of Energy to prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment
on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How sensible is it to sail a ship carrying plutonium round the
world at a time when world security is volatile? Whenever such a
deadly substance is moved, there will be a risk of accidents or
terrorist attacks. In the event of an incident, plutonium could be
dispersed into the ocean, poisoning people and the marine
environment on which we depend," said local Charleston resident
Merrill Chapman of Citizens Against Plutonium.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="67469"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Homeland Security wrote to Representative
Ed Markey on September 8, telling him that "Coast Guard cutters,
boats, aircraft and other local law enforcement and Navy assets"
would be involved securing the passage of the ship. While the same
letter admitted that no "formal threat assessment" had been
prepared on the shipment, it seems that the Coast Guard had
prepared "a field intelligence report" on environmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This transport is part of a misguided plan to put weapons
plutonium into commercial use by converting it into MOX fuel for
use in nuclear reactors. This is an expensive and dangerous way to
dispose of plutonium. All existing plutonium should be secured and
mixed with nuclear waste and vitrified in robust containers, "
concluded Clements.&lt;/p&gt;

	After weeks of cat-and-mouse antics, the Pacific Pintail slipped into the port of Cherbourg with a deadly cargo of Plutonium -- but only after a French court ensured Greenpeace would be kept out of the way.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists onboard the Greenpeace ship MV Esperanza wait off the coast of France for the imminent arrival of the Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the cover of darkness, the Pintail -- one of two vessels
carrying a plutonium shipment from Charleston, South Carolina --
was escorted by sister vessel the Pacific Teal, all the while being
tracked by the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza. It arrived at the dock
at 5:45 AM, to be met by six yachts from the Atlantic Nuclear Free
Flotilla flying "Stop Plutonium" banners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An escort of six security inflatables with marine commandos,
four military boats and two helicopters was also waiting and
guarded the vessel as it entered the French port. The French
Gendarmerie also established a closed security zone in the harbour
in an attempt to stop any protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment of weapons plutonium is a wake-up call to the
world - rather than ship this dangerous material worldwide, now is
the time for aggressive steps to halt proliferation of all nuclear
weapons materials," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace
International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="67847"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The military nature of the arrival in France clearly
demonstrates that nuclear weapons materials are a threat to global
security and have no place in commerce."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being unloaded in La Hague, the cargo of 140 kg of
plutonium oxide will be transported in the coming 24 hours more
than 1,000 kilometres to a plutonium fuel fabrication facility in
Caradache, Provence, in the South of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route has not been announced for the land transport which is
perhaps the most vulnerable stage in terms of accident or terrorist
attack. Areva plans to convert the plutonium into an experimental
fuel known as 'MOX' (mixed plutonium uranium oxide fuel), after
which it transported back to the US early in 2005, to then be
tested in US reactor over three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Transportation of plutonium is highly vulnerable to accidents
or deliberate attack and must be stopped. After the Atlantic
crossing this transport is about to wind its way through France
threatening everything in its path. It will be too late if there is
a disaster to inform the people of France - that is what Greenpeace
is determined to do over these coming days," said Shaun Burnie of
Greenpeace International.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="67874"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to the transport, as it is part of a
global programme led by France's state-owned nuclear company Areva,
and the governments of the US and Russia, to commercialise the
large-scale use of weapons-grade plutonium as fuel in nuclear
reactors. Such a program not only increases the vulnerability of
plutonium but also sends the wrong nuclear proliferation signal
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the claimed secrecy of the transport routes, Greenpeace
has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/428875/0/transport.swf"&gt;
routinely tracked and photographed nuclear shipments&lt;/a&gt; in
France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this weapons-grade plutonium fuel experiment succeeds, a
total of 68 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from US and Russian
weapons stockpiles - enough to make more than 15,000 nuclear bombs
- will be exposed to theft, diversion and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Isabel Allende goes Ancient Forest friendly</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/isabel-allende-goes-ancient-fo/</url><text>
	Last year, Harry Potter went Ancient Forest friendly in Canada. Now, for the first time, a major Spanish publisher has taken steps towards being ancient-forest friendly, with the release of Isabel Allende's new book printed on recycled and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper.  Isabel Allende is calling for her publishers around the world to follow suit.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Isabel Allende supporting our Book Campaign at the release of her latest book
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publishing company Random House Mondadori has printed
bestselling Chilean-born author Isabel Allende's new book 'Forest
of the Pygmies' paperback edition on 100 percent recycled paper and
the hardback on 30 percent &lt;a href="http://www.fsc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Forest Stewardship Council&lt;/a&gt; paper. The publisher
has also has committed to printing all its youth books under its
Montena label on recycled paper by 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How great it is that my Spanish book is on Ancient Forest
friendly paper and that by doing so, I am playing a part in
protecting the world's ancient forests," says Isabel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she also added that she would like to see other publishers
around the world follow her example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would like all my other publishers to follow the example set
by my Spanish publishers and use Ancient Forest friendly papers for
my books," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Ancient Forest friendly paper doesn't only save trees - it
also saves water and electricity, reduces solid waste produced in
the publishing process, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gas
and other emissions released in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Prologue of Isabel Allende's new book "El Bosque de los Pigmeos"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Text translated from Spanish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have always been committed to forest protection. It was not
in vain that I founded, together with Chilean personalities, the
ecological group 'Defenders of the Chilean Forest'. In all my
novels, especially this Trilogy, the ethical component and the
respect for nature and its inhabitants are repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I supported the US campaign demanding that Chilean timber sold
in that country is certified according to the social and
environmental requirements of the ecological label FSC, with the
aim of preventing industrial pine plantations being substituted for
native forests of my country, which is still formed by virgin
forests that contain great biodiversity and cultural richness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to show my most sincere appreciation to the ecological
organisation Greenpeace and the editorial group Random House
Mondadori for this initiative that benefits us all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Isabel Allende&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The Book Campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This positive step by Random House Mondadori is the result of
collaboration with our Book Campaign that aims to encourage the
book publishing industry to stop sourcing paper linked to ancient
forest destruction and to start developing 'Ancient Forest
friendly' solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isabel Allende is not the only well-known author working towards
reducing her work's impact on ancient forests. Famous writers such
as Margaret Atwood, JK Rowling, Ian Rankin and Günter Grass are
also having their books published on &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/extra/?item_id=565827&amp;amp;forward_source_anchor=Additional%20information&amp;amp;forward_destination_anchor=&amp;amp;campaign_id=3938"&gt;
ancient-forest friendly paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, Italian publisher Einaudi has published
4 books on 100 percent recycled paper as a result of the Greenpeace
book campaign and 14 Dutch publishers, representing 75 percent of
the fiction market in the Netherlands, have committed to using
Ancient Forest friendly book papers. The UK publisher Bloomsbury
has also made initial steps by printing the paperback edition of
'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' on a part recycled
paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian edition of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix' helped save 'muggle' forests as it was printed on 100
percent post-consumer paper.&lt;/p&gt;

	At the opening of the Premier Vision textile exhibition in Paris, activists dressed in black t-shirts - each one revealing the faces of Bhopal victims - confronted Dow Chemical as the company presented its new fibre, XLA. Dow Chemical is responsible for the 1984 disaster in the Indian city of Bhopal - a tragedy that still continues, even twenty years later.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace displays a banner with pictures of the victims of the world's worst industrial disaster-Bhopal- at the opening of an international textile exhibition in Paris, where DOW Chemical, the entity responsible for the 1984 disaster presented a new fibre called XLA. We're asking asking Dow Chemical to face its moral and financial responsibilities before investing in new markets.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Dow launch, our activists displayed a massive banner showing pictures of the world's worst industrial disaster and distributed 4,000 flyers regarding the company's corporate irresponsibility. Along with the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal - an International coalition of Bhopal survivors and International NGOs campaigning for justice in Bhopal - we demand that Dow accepts full liability for the ongoing disaster in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Dow representatives claimed that their textile launch had nothing to do with corporate accountability, and refused to meet any of the Bhopal survivors - suggesting that Dow cares more about its new line of fabrics than the plight of thousands of Bhopalis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, a delegation from Dow France arrived, and quickly agreed to meet our team and the young Bhopal victims. During the meeting, the General Manager of Dow France, Pierre-Jean Brochand, promised to answer survivors' questions on what Dow will do about the clean up of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were really surprised - Dow really didn't expect us to show up at a textile show. But then we were astonished to find them taking such a proactive stance. Most of the time Dow try to avoid us - this time they seemed to have been softened up, and a little threatened by our sudden appearance. The outcome was that we managed to me M. Brochand, who has promised to get us answers in the next few days. We need to know what they're going to do about the clean up of Bhopal - and what they're not going to do," said Greenpeace France campaigner Aurele Clemencin, who was at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bhopal disaster occured on 3 December 1984, when more than 40 tonnes of poisonous gases leaked from a storage tank at a Union Carbide (now owned by Dow) pesticide factory into the heart of Bhopal, immediately killing 8,000 people. In the last twenty years, another 20,000 people have died from illnesses caused by the disaster. Survivors and their children are still dealing with the long-term health effects, including cancer, tuberculosis, birth defects and chronic fevers. In June 2004, the Government of India submitted a statement to the New York District Court on the Bhopal contamination clean up case, asking Union Carbide to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The people affected by the disaster now live in the shadow of an ongoing environmental and health catastrophe. The banner that carries the faces of the Bhopali victims reveals the hidden collection of Dow - the real story of Bhopal after twenty years. We, the people of Bhopal have suffered for 20 years now and it is disheartening to discover that instead of taking responsibility for cleaning up the polluted disaster site in Bhopal and offering medical assistance to the ailing survivors, Dow is busy making profits." Said Rani Niloufer, one of the Bhopal survivor who met with Dow. Rani was born the year of the disaster, and still suffers from the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow should pay for the health treatments of the survivors, and clean up both the large stockpiles of dangerous poisons and the contaminated underground water left behind at the accident site. Our activists have worked in Bhopal since 1999. Back then, a when a team of our scientists worked with Bhopal community groups, analysing the severity and extent of the contamination on and around the factory site. We found severe contamination of both land and water supplies by heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dow investors, and all those who will buy this fabric, should be aware that Dow has blood on their hands and no new textile will help them hide their crimes in Bhopal. Only when they pay for all the survivors' health treatments and clean up the poisonous site, will justice be done," added Vinuta Gopal, Greenpeace campaigner from India protesting today in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Dow really answer the questions of the Bhopal victims? Stay tuned to find out...&lt;/p&gt;

	Following a meeting yesterday with the Norwegian Transport Minister, Ford Europe has confirmed it will not scrap its US fleet of zero emission electric cars, but instead send them to eager customers in Norway.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ford reverses plans to crush all its electric Th!nk cars. Ford had planned on crushing this environmental solution because it succeeded in trashing the California legislation that encouraged their use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford was planning to scrap their US fleet of electric Th!nk
vehicles,but following pressure from us and other environmental
groups, the carmanufacturer has changed its mind. Last month, our
activists occupiedthe roof of Ford Norway's offices, prompting
Norwegian Transport andCommunications Minister Torild Skogsholm to
ask Ford to Th!nk again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 300 of the cars will now be shipped to Norway, and sold
throughFord dealerships to eager customers. Ford has even thanked
Greenpeacefor having brought this issue to their attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford had attempted to justify scrapping the cars by citing a
lack ofUS government regulation, and have since claimed that some
180 of thecars have already been scrapped. This was despite the
Th!nk car'spopularity with American consumers - there's been
waiting lists to buythe cars since the hugely popular leasing
period started in 2001.Zero-emission cars reduce urban smog, and
when charged by electricityfrom renewable sources, they help fight
the biggest threat to ourplanet: climate change. With rising oil
prices causing increasedgasoline costs, they are also a sound
economic choice. Popular, cleanand efficient, shouldn't this be
part of the future of transport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's initial U-turn - which highlights how ludicrous the
originalplan to crush the electric cars was - took little over a
week. Weannounced it on September 1st, and it has taken another two
weeks toget confirmation. The first batch of cars is due to arrive
in Norway inNovember, thanks to shipping company Wallenius
Wilhelmsen, with morecars to follow in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is all good news, it seems this corporate leopard
doesn'tchange its oily spots so easily. Ford still has the most
fossil fuelhungry fleet of cars in the US. In the same week it
reversed thecrushing decision, Ford CEO Bill Ford wrote a letter to
Californiagovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposing a proposed law
that wouldencourage purchases of the most fuel-efficient cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not scrapping electric cars is a start, Ford should now
befocusing on is producing environmentally friendly, zero
emissionvehicles for the mass market. Currently the company likes
to market agreen image even though its current fleet of cars is
actually lessefficient than the 80-year-old Model-T Ford!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford should stop hiding behind empty talk about experimental
fuelcells, and instead do as Henry Ford would have done;
continuouslyimprove efficiency and establish mass production of the
most advancedzero emissions technology available today - modern
battery electricvehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

	George Bush's government is out in the cold over Kyoto - and it's that old Cold War enemy, Russia, that's put it there. The Russian government has moved closer towards ratifying the crucial Kyoto climate change treaty. But while Bush hangs out in hurricane-ravaged Florida before his first election debate, the US government continues to criticise the Kyoto Treaty.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists in 19 countries demonstrated in 2003 in front of Russian Embassies urging President Putin to sign the Kyoto Protocol.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The tipping point&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Putin's motives, the fact that he and the Russian
government have taken this first step is undoubtedly good news for
anyone worried about climate change - and a slap in the face for
George Bush and oil companies like ExxonMobil. The Kyoto
ratification comes as a breath of fresh (and unpolluted) air at a
time when news headlines are dominated by oil dependency and
extreme weather horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the Earth is battered by increasing storms, floods and
droughts, President Putin has brought us to a pivotal point in
human history today," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner, Steve
Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final decision about whether or not Russia will ratify Kyoto
now rests with the Russian Parliament, the Duma. If it votes in
favour, the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force and will become
international law, a decision likely to happen within a few weeks.
The Protocol must be ratified by no less than 55 countries
accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions in 1990, so
Russia could finally tip the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Meanwhile, back at the ranch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But George W. Bush insists on raining on the parade. The US
emits one fifth of the world's greenhouse gases, so unless the US
ratifies or at the very least changes its domestic policies - a
scenario distinctly unlikely under Bush - Kyoto will not fully
achieve its targets. "Kyoto is 'an unrealistic and ever-tightening
regulatory straitjacket, curtailing energy consumption'," said the
US Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, in the &lt;i&gt;Financial
Times&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Australia have not yet ratified the treaty, but they
are definitely out in the cold on this one - as of July 29th 2004,
124 countries had ratified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an important first step in tackling
climate change - but there is still a long way to go. "To tackle
climate change we must stop relying on oil, coal and gas to meet
our energy needs and urgently redirect our investment into safer,
cleaner sources of energy such as wind, wave and solar power," said
Steve Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our team of Greenpeace Jaguars, who have been protecting the ancient forests of Argentina from the expansion of Genetically Engineered soya, have been arrested while documenting the deforestation in northern Argentina some 1800 km north of Buenos Aires in the city of Tartagal, north of Salta province.

            Greenpeace activists, dressed as 'jaguars', used chains to immobilise bulldozers that have been destroying Yungas forest in north west Argentina. Argentina's forests are being cut down to grow Monsanto's genetically engineered soya for export as animal feed to Europe and China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the nine is Martin Prieto the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceArgentina. The Jaguars' lawyer was also thrown into jail,
thusdepriving them of legal representation. Our team in Argentina
hasspoken with the Jaguars and for now they remain in good
spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that they were arrested for the misdemeanour
oftrespassing, so far the judge has decided not to release them and
couldkeep them in jail for days. For now they are being held under
custodyin the Intelligence Brigade of the State Police of Salta in
a localpolice station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jaguars have been prowling Argentina's native forests for

<item><language>en</language><title>Accident at Japan nuclear plant</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/accident-at-japan-nuclear-plan/</url><text>
	A fatal accident has killed at least four people at the Mihama nuclear power plant in Japan. There was no leak of radioactivity but it is the deadliest accident in a catalogue of nuclear scandals in Japan.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Fishermen in front of the Mihama nuclear plant after the 1991 accident at the plant. Now a second accident has claimed the live of at least four workers. Alternative energy sources like wind and solar would have avoided this pollution and death.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven workers were also injured due to the steam leak, possibly
caused by a lack of cooling water in the reactor. This latest
accident follows the explosion at Tokaimura plant in 1999, where
workers mixed radioactive material in a bucket, causing a reaction
that killed two workers, injured several more and irradiated
hundreds of civilians. In 1997 also at Tokaimura a fire and
explosion released radioactive gas into the atmosphere. In 1995 a
serious accident at the Monju fast breeder reactor led to its shut
down. In 1991 another reactor at the same Mihama plant suffered a
serious radioactive leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is heavily reliant on dangerous nuclear power for its
electricity. While the government recklessly backs the nuclear
industry come what may, public opposition to nuclear power is
growing due the appalling safety record of the industry. Tokyo
Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is still trying to recover from the
recent scandal it caused by falsifying safety inspections, which
forced it to shut down all of its 17 nuclear reactors. Kansai
Electric Power Company, the owner of Mihama, was also implicated in
that scandal. TEPCO has also just shutdown a nuclear power
generation unit at its Fukushima-Daini plant because of a water
leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansai Electric was also at the centre of a nuclear scandal in
1999, when nuclear fuel delivered by British Nuclear Fuels was
found to contain falsified safety data. The resultant scandal set
back Japan's plans to use large amounts of plutonium as fuel in its
reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's nuclear reactors are ageing - many are almost 30 years
old. Rather than increasing safety measure and closing old reactors
the government is doing the exact opposite - reducing regulation of
the industry. As nuclear power is so expensive many of the
generating companies have huge debts and have cut plant safety
measures to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, hundreds of billions of yen are being sought
to cover the costs of a new plutonium reprocessing plant at
Rokkasho-mura in northern Japan, which is hugely uneconomic,
environmentally polluting, and increases the risk of nuclear
proliferation in east Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there remain many uncertainties as to the exact cause of
this accident at Mihama, one thing is certain - there will be more
and worse to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This avoidable loss of life comes on the 59th anniversary of the
dropping of the US nuclear bomb on the Japanese city of
Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the legacy of Nagasaki, this Mihama accident, the
appalling safety record of the nuclear industry, and with low
public trust in the country's nuclear program, the government and
industry is pressing ahead with more new nuclear power plants and
new nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives sources of energy, such as wind, are not only safe,
but are also cleaner and cheaper than nuclear power. A suitable
response to these deaths would be the ditching of the dangerous,
expensive and polluting menace of nuclear power in favour of
alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Busted!  New Zealand trawlers caught in the act</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bottom-trawlers-caught-red-ha/</url><text>
	Looks like somebody was throwing us a red herring. Last week, Greenpeace activists targeted the Nelson, New Zealand headquarters of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC) in a peaceful protest against destructive bottom trawling. Their Chief Executive denied operating in international waters.  But guess what our ship, Rainbow Warrior, just found?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The catch is hauled aboard the NZ deep sea trawler Corsair in international waters in the Tasman sea.  The red fish is orange roughy, the rest is mostly bycatch to be discarded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-presents-6000-stron/"&gt; &lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior located the Amaltal Voyager, Westbay, and Corsair around 350 miles off the coast of New Zealand on the Northwest Challenger Plateau. The plot thickens: it turns out that the Amaltal Fishing Company is a shareholder of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;previous bravado&lt;/a&gt;, the bottom trawling industry doesn't seem to want to communicate. The occupants of the three ships haven't responded to our contact via radio - except occasionally with, shall we say, "impolite" hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our intrepid Greenpeace activists documented the fishing activities on the high seas in the face of an unexpectedly large swell and a little subsequent seasickness, a different type of Greenpeace delegation began talks at the UN to secure a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. New Zealand will now be in the hot seat since all of the vessels revealed by the Rainbow Warrior were registered in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="61239"&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government has yet to say whether it will support or oppose a moratorium but they must be feeling the heat in New York at the moment," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, from aboard the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at a UN press conference delegates were treated to a rare broadcast from on board the Rainbow Warrior giving them a first hand look at the activists at work. Many scientists also made presentations at the conference - in fact over a thousand of them are supporting the call for a moratorium on bottom trawling because of the absolute devastation caused by this fishing technique. Many species have not even been described or discovered before they are fished out, while ancient corals and sponges are decimated, with little chance of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are only a small number of nations responsible for this environmental devastation," said Karen Sack, Greenpeace International Oceans Policy Advisor, at the UN. "While they reap rich rewards, the biodiversity of the least protected area of this planet is being wiped out. That is why the United Nations must impose an immediate moratorium on bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

	The spectre of genetically engineered (GE) rice is looming on the horizon, especially in China where the government plans to introduce it soon. To see what is at risk from this dangerous gamble we have been visiting heartlands of rice production in China and now you can share our amazing experiences.

            Child in traditional costume of the local tribe. Traditional agriculture in this and across Asia is threatened by the planned introduction of GE rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice is the staple diet for most Chinese people and it is the
source of livelihood for more than 100 million farmers, it is
cultivated in traditional paddy fields such as these in the Yunnan
Province. During our &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/"&gt;Rice is
Life tour&lt;/a&gt; in Yunnan, four buses carrying farmers, journalists,
volunteers and rice experts looked for the best ways to ensure the
sustainable development and agriculture of rice as well as
educating locals against the dangers of GE rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the week diaries cataloguing the tour's progress and its
amazing experiences were written by five different volunteers. Two
of the volunteers, &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/left03.htm"&gt;
Lisa (aka Lizardfish)&lt;/a&gt; from Bermuda and &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/left04.htm"&gt;
Akiko&lt;/a&gt; from Sweden via Japan wrote about their experiences in
English. Lisa is one of our most &lt;a href="http://guardians.greenpeace.org/treehouse?user_id=489848"&gt;active
online community members&lt;/a&gt; and earned a place on the tour by
getting the &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1094027942/index_html"&gt;most people
involved&lt;/a&gt; in online actions against GE rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To catch a glimpse of the beauty of this province and the way of
life that is at risk from GE rice, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/multimedia/slideshow-view?item_id=621882"&gt;
watch our slideshow&lt;/a&gt; and read the diary highlights from Akiko
and Lisa below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;16th October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour kicked off with an opening ceremony in Kuming,
Yunnan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish16102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; "It was a cloudy and misty morning with birds I had
never heard before twittering to us as we walked along the pathway
past ornamental flower beds bursting with colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first task of the day was to remain stationed at a junction
in the pathways and direct bus tour people towards the stage where
we were having the opening ceremony. Pretty soon though it began to
rain and before long I was rather soggy. So many of the people who
needed my directions offered me their umbrella and seemed quite
concerned about my excessive moisture situation. Thankfully it
didn't last long. I stood there for an hour or so and said "nee
how:" (hello in Mandarin) to everyone as they came by. Some people
were rather shocked that I could speak so much Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="The Rice is Life Tour launched and blessed by local farmers." title="The Rice is Life Tour launched and blessed by local farmers." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68526"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko16102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; Farmers and host guests put stickers on 4 buses for the
tour. The stickers said "Cheil Lal Ku". It means "Call for the
spirit of rice". Wow! The Hani's way. Ask the rice spirit to come
back. I will follow the wisdom of rice and express my deep
appreciation to rice and people who have been farming rice for many
generations. I am very excited about visiting the rice field
tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;17th October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Dai farmers taking photos of their own ecological agriculture." title="Dai farmers taking photos of their own ecological agriculture." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="68529"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;One
of the first stops for the tour was in Xinping where the buses
visited a village of Doi people and experienced the Doi way of
life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish18102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; I have never seen rice harvesting taking place
before. The farmers pick up a large bunch of the rice plants and
smack them against the inside of a wooden trough and all the rice
grains simply fall off. Some of the farmers on our bus tour picked
up some rice plants and helped out. Apparently many farming
communities work this way. They help each other all the time. So
one family's farm will have everyone in the entire community
working it at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at our destination everyone was split up into 3
groups and each group was to go into a paddy field to greet working
farmers and help them to take Polaroid pictures expressing "rice in
their eyes".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the paddy fields I was shocked at how narrow the
mud wall was on which we had to navigate. My nerves took hold of my
legs and as I stepped sideways along the slippery wall my knees
began to wobble like jelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Rice fields at sunset in the Yunnan Province." title=" Rice fields at sunset in the Yunnan Province." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="63839"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko17102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; A few times during the day, I felt tears in my eyes,
while sitting on the bus looking outside. It happened when I was
looking at mountains through the window. First I thought they are
so beautiful and very natural. Then I remembered about mountains I
saw when I was in Japan travelling by trains this summer. Most of
the mountains had big electric power plants on the top. I felt
really bad every time I saw mountains that had metal stacked in it.
I felt the mother earth, who is wise enough to be so patient. Maybe
that's why I felt relief today, when I noticed about natural
mountains in Xinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;18th October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour travelled further into the province of Yunnan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko18102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; Today, we were on the bus for about 9 hours to come to
Yuan Yang. We left Xinping at 8 in the morning, after the
breakfast. I knew it will be a long journey, so I have planned
yesterday to ask some questions to a farmer, Li Shuin To, from the
north part of Yunnan, who is a participant of the bus tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is from a farmer's family and he is the 8th generations
following the family path. He is 31 years old, and lives with 4
generations together. He has a little daughter. I was very curious
first of all about how much Shuin To knows about GMOs. He said he
did not know anything about it until he came to the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is very scary", he said. He is very concerned and he wants
more information in order to tell his friends and local farmers
about it. He said he will try to find books about GMOs and research
more about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;19th October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Hani children in traditional costume in the Yunnan Province." title="Hani children in traditional costume in the Yunnan Province." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="68862"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
tour arrived in Honghe where the Hani people live and also practice
traditional farming methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish19102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; The days have been very long and I feel as if I
have been in China for many weeks already. However, the tour has
only been going for 4 days (we have 4 days left). Mostly the views
are spectacular especially when the sun is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mountains are all covered in lush green vegetation and the 4
buses climb up winding roads to the tops of mountains and drive
along valleys through clouds and mist and forest. The journeys
we've been doing are usually quite bumpy and bendy so just as you
are falling asleep you nearly slide off your seat and are awoken in
a state of panic. Sleeping on the bus is therefore almost
impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko19102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; I really feel from the native farmers I met on this bus
tour that they truly love their livelihoods, and their strong
connection to the mother earth. When we stopped the bus for taking
some photos of the terrace field, I noticed a sign. It said,
"Protect Our Natural Environment. Let this warning message be with
you!". A very powerful message for us humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see a part of the terrace, since the father sky asked
the mist to go away for a while for us. I thanked to the father sky
and to the mother earth. My 6th day in China started with this
powerful experience. So far I like this day best, I said to
myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;20th October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice New Year celebrations in the heartland of rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Hani's new year: rice harvest celebration in Honghe." title="Hani's new year: rice harvest celebration in Honghe." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68547"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish20102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; WOW! What a day! We are in Jiayin, which is a Hani
village. They are celebrating the New Year today. The Hani have
their own calendar which it is based on rice growing and
harvesting. Now that the rice is harvested there is cause for much
celebration. This place is very famous for the rice festival of the
Hani's because everyone eats dinner on the street in a long line of
hundreds of tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko20102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; The Hani festival for the rice harvest, which is their
new year, reminded me of my childhood time. The atmosphere in the
whole village was very similar to the summer festival I have had up
until my teenage time in my town. Everybody was so excited and very
busy preparing the foods. A lot of food. Different thing was the
way they prepared the food. The Hani people prepared meat dishes
from the very beginning. They brought a cow, a pig and chickens in
the morning from their farms into the town, and killed them, cut
them and cooked them with different vegetables and spices in the
centre of the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;21st October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More celebrations and experiences in the neighbouring
village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish21102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; The walk to the village was breathtaking. We went
through forest and stood overlooking the lush, green valley. It was
very tranquil and I wished we could have walked more or stayed on
this path for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we walked to some terraces with local farmers and helped
them use Polaroid cameras like last time. I was in charge of the
equipment again and would you believe it, they had me walking down
steep slippery rocks with all this stuff (flash back to paddy field
instability)! We also went into a farmer's house and took pictures
there. My favourite place to help them take photos was on a roof
where women were raking the rice out to dry. I had never seen this
being done before. Rice is everywhere! In the fields, in the
kitchen, in the grinding sheds and on the roofs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko21102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt; The proper way to enter the village of Hani's is to go
though the main gate. A few of us witnessed this afternoon that a
young man was invited to a very old Hani woman, who seems like the
most wise woman of the village. She gave him a ritual ceremony by
singing and giving him some initiation. I would like to be a wise
old woman who can understand the deep meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that I am very impressed that Greenpeace together
with the co-organizers could prepare this wonderful and amazing
tour. I noticed that the farmers who are participating with the
tour are very satisfied and pleased to be here with us. Thanks
Greenpeace!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;End of tour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akiko and Lizardfish's thoughts on GE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish21102004.htm"&gt;
Lizardfish:&lt;/a&gt; These kind and trusting people are completely
oblivious to the dangers that lie ahead. Someone could walk into
their village in 2005 and convince them to grow GE rice so easily
by telling a few lies. If rice growing communities in China are all
similar in this respect, then they are all vulnerable to this kind
of persuasion. If something goes wrong with the GE crops then these
communities will disintegrate and the people will have to move to
the cities, which will then engulf the countryside more and
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence indicates that the probability of agricultural
catastrophe resulting from the use of GE crops is significant
enough to warrant great concern. I am pleased that Greenpeace China
is going to continue to raise awareness about this issue together
with ecological rice farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/akiko20102004.htm"&gt;
Akiko:&lt;/a&gt;GMOs should not be released into the nature anymore. This
is our responsibility to stop this. It is our responsibility to
keep the traditional knowledge alive. GMOs are destroyers of the
long lasting relationship between nature and us. This is one of the
biggest challenges for all of us. We should all stand up on this
urgent matter, it is not too late, but really urgent. GMOs should
not be released into the nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rice is Life Tour is now over but we'll leave it to
Lizardfish to &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/lizardfish24102004.htm"&gt;
sum it up&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope with all my heart that these beautiful (inside and out)
minorities will continue to farm rice without interference from the
biotech companies. However, hoping isn't enough to ensure this. We
can sit here and hope as much as we like but we still need to DO
SOMETHING!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What you can do:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a selection of &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafety.org.cn/special/ricetour/eng/right01.htm"&gt;

	Rice has been a grown around the world for over 10,000 years, it is cultivated in 113 countries and 3000 million people rely on it as a staple food. All of this is in danger as the spectre of genetic engineering creeps up on the planet's most important food crop.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A girl carries a fish caught from the rice field.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears the Chinese government could start the planting
ofgenetically engineered (GE) rice as early as 2005. What is for
sure isthat the GE industry must be cheering on the Chinese
Government on GErice as this will no doubt encourage the rest of
Asia to go GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are they taking this risky step, are they tackling a
majorproblem with their domestic rice crops? Not that we can see.
Will itincrease yields? Not if it follows the patterns of current
loweryielding GE crops. Will it endanger the thousands of strains
of non-GErice in China? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is home to rice and still possesses one of the richest
geneticdiversities of rice in the world - boasting some 75,000
strains. Notonly is rice vital to China's food supply but it is
also at the heartof its culture - as with most of Asia. GE rice
threatens all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems ironic that while China develops GE rice, the UN's
Foodand Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is celebrating 2004 as
'TheInternational Year of Rice' and World Food Day under the slogan
that'Rice Is Life'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" After finishing a half day of harsh farm work, a Hani rice farmer eats his rice from a traditional bamboo bowl." border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="68340"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Noone,
except a few GE scientists and government officials, knows that
GErice may reach their rice bowls soon," said Sze Pang Cheung,
CampaignManager of Greenpeace China. "This is scandalous as rice is
the staplediet for most Chinese people and it is the source of
livelihood formore than 100 million farmers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If GE rice is grown in the field, it will contaminate
localvarieties. Research by Chinese scientists has found that the
pollen ofGE rice may spread as far as 110 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If rice is life, GE rice is a gamble with our life. Moreover,
GErice can multiply and spread once released into the environment.
It isa gamble with no way back," Sze commented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, under Chinese regulation, there is
norequirement for the public to be informed and consulted before a
GEcrop is approved for commercialisation. Once an application
reaches theMinistry of Agriculture, the ministry will commission
researchinstitutes to carry out environmental and safety
assessments, whichusually last from three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Women in traditional costume in the Yunnan Province" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="63836"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Commercialisationof
GE rice in China would have regional and global impact. It is
widelybelieved that India, the second largest producer and consumer
of rice,and other rice producing countries (Thailand and Vietnam),
may followChina's footsteps if it commercialises GE rice. The GE
industry alsohopes that commercialisation of GE rice will open up

for the GE industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The way ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this International Year of Rice the UN has called
upondifferent stakeholders in the world to promote the sustainable
futureof rice. Here at Greenpeace we are taking this very seriously
and havealready organised a cyberaction sending letters to
officials at the FAOto remind them that rice needs to be protected
from GE at all costs -over 5400 letters have been sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The future of rice should stay in the hands of those for whom
riceis life, not a few GE scientists and officials," said Sze. "If
we areto promote the sustainable future of rice farming, GE rice is
simplynot the answer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A Hani farmer is holding his traditional rice seeds in his hand, Yunnan Province, China." border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="66269"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Aswell
as the cyberaction the "The Rice is Life Tour" in Yunnan provinceis
taking place between 16-24 October, which has the richest
diversityof rice in China. For eight days we are travelling the
province withjournalists, rice experts and people concerned about
GE rice fromDenmark, UK, Hong Kong and mainland China. During the
tour we will belooking for the best ways to ensure the sustainable
development of riceand safeguarding cultural traditions in the
heart of one of the world'shomelands of rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice farmers need to understand that the short-term
productivitygains from new technologies - such as GE - are not
sustainable and havewill have a serious economic and cultural
impact on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what the biotech cheerleaders say alleviating poverty
andfeeding the world requires more than a technological solution.
GE ricedoes not solve these problems. The environmental release of
artificiallife forms into the environment will lead to inevitable
andirreversible damage, which will in turn undermine food security
andsustainable agriculture in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            A group of Greenpeace activists hang a banner reading 'Don't Trade Away the Planet' from the Rama IX bridge in the Thai capital of Bangkok.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last several weeks the Rainbow Warrior has been in
Bangkok, Thailand, leading the battle at the Convention on
International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). This isn't just
any old convention, the results are global and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our key objectives for CITES were to achieve increased
protection for some key ocean and forest species. We were also
determined to ensure that Japan did not achieve its proposed
downlisting of minke whales - which would have meant that limited
numbers of them could be caught and traded commercially. (So much
for their "scientific" whaling program!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When CITES opened, an extensive Kids for Forest programme raised
the profile of the issues in Thailand. Children built a jungle in
one of Bangkok's most famous parks over the weekend when CITES was
meeting, took part in a Kids Parade at the meeting venue and made a
presentation to the Thai Environment Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a blow by blow account of what happened in Thailand ...
and what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td class="tabheadselected"&gt;How CITES Works&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;Species under CITES are classed in an
"Appendix" detailing the level of protection:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appendix I&lt;/b&gt; includes species threatened with extinction.
Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in
exceptional circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appendix II&lt;/b&gt; includes species not necessarily threatened
with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to
avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appendix III&lt;/b&gt; contains species that are protected in at
least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for
assistance in controlling the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 1: PROTECT RAMIN TREE
SPECIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/multimedia/download/1/603234/0/ramin_lr.pdf"&gt;
Download Ramin Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramin is a key tree species for the survival of orang-utans in
SE Asia and one which is being traded illegally and unsustainably,
particularly in Europe. It now has Appendix II protection under
CITES. Another commercially exploited timber species, Agarwood,
which is traded particularly in the Middle East, also got Appendix
II protection.
&lt;inline_item width="100" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68352"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the convention, Greenpeace completed a six-week
investigation in the field into illegal ramin smuggling from
Sumatra, Indonesia, into Malaysia and Singapore. These findings
were released with the arrival of the Rainbow Warrior in
Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't stop there though - activists protested outside the
embassies of Malaysia and Japan against Malaysia's involvement in
the illegal ramin trade and their opposition to the Appendix II
listing for ramin. We also highlighted Japan's "horrendous," (to
quote one campaigner) positions on ocean issues. "[They were] so
awful it was unreal!" If you think that's an exaggeration, then
keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 2: PROTECT GREAT WHITE
SHARK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item width="100" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68337"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
Governments of Australia and Madagascar had proposed the listing of
the great white shark on Appendix II. Despite its high profile, not
to mention fame as the star of the horror movie 'Jaws', the great
white shark has become a rarity in the world's oceans. As great
white sharks travel long distances and cross national boundaries,
intergovernmental efforts to protect the species are crucial to
their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great white shark was awarded Appendix II status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 3: PROTECT HUMPHEAD WRASSE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

a humphead wrasse, we hear you ask? The Governments of Fiji, the
Member States of the European Community, and the US have submitted
a proposal for the inclusion of this funny-looking fish in CITES
Appendix II in response to the over exploitation of the species
from international trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Japan was fierce in its determination to stop this
but was heavily defeated in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 4: SAVE THE IRRAWADDY
DOLPHIN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

Download Irrawaddy Dolphin Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irrawaddy dolphin, a rare cetacean from Asia, got onto
Appendix I despite concerted efforts from a number of nations
including (no surprises here) Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 5: PROTECT THE MINKE WHALE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also completely failed in its attempts to get minke whales
downlisted - they were yet again heavily defeated.
&lt;inline_item width="100" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="68349"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the disastrous impacts of whaling during the 20th
century, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) suspended
commercial whaling in 1986. Japan is keen to resume trade in whale
products, but in order to do so they need to downlist whales from
CITES Appendix I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 5th successive proposal by Japan to downlist minke
whales from Appendix I to Appendix II. All previous proposals
failed by a substantial voting majority because they did not meet
the necessary scientific criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;MISSION 6: PROTECT AFRICAN
ELEPHANTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;RESULT: PARTIAL VICTORY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25753/africanelephant.pdf"&gt;
Download African Elephant Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia put in a proposal to have an annual quota of raw ivory
of 2000 kgs. They also sought permission to trade in "worked
ivory"- these are carvings made by local communities which are used
in jewellery. Both South Africa and Namibia wanted to trade in
elephant hair and leather goods.
&lt;inline_item width="100" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68355"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time Kenya submitted a resolution for a 20-year
moratorium until systems were in place to effectively control
domestic and international trade in ivory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unforunately, the Kenyan proposal failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Namibia's proposal to have an annual
sale of 2000 kgs was also rejected by parties, thoug in the end a
majority agreed the sale of ivory carvings by local communities for
"non-commercial" purposes. Both South Africa's and Namibia's
proposal to sell elephant leather and hair goods were agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are not supportive of this," said Greenpeace campaigner
Nathalie Rey. "History shows that any sale of ivory products
increases the likelihood of illegal trade and poaching of
elephants. These proposals were agreed despite a number of
countries with elephant populations (Kenya, India) arguing that
this is dangerous for the conservation of their own elephants."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, the 25 EU votes abstained on the issue, which
gave Namibia the numbers they needed to approve trade in worked
ivory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;After CITES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="68202"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
most important aspect of CITES is that it is not the usual type of
political meeting. "This Convention is not just a talk fest. When
parties vote for listings of species this has real bite and is
legally binding," said Greenpeace campaigner Tim Birch. This means
that delegates left the convention with a lot of homework -
implementing the agreements made so that the crucial protection for
these endangered species is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

	One of Greenpeace's founders, the photographer and journalist Rex Weyler, has just published a chronicle of the organisation's first decade entitled Greenpeace -- How a Group of Ecologists, Journalists, and Visionaries Changed the World. Rex is the author of the Native American history Blood of the Land, for which he received a Pulitzer Prize nomination, and co-author of the bestseller Chop Wood, Carry Water. He wrote the following recollection of an early Greenpeace "test action" for Greenpeace.org:

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cover of the book 'Greenpeace' by Rex Weyler. This is a record of an extraordinary journey,  portrayed by someone who helped make it happen. Weyler introduces us to the characters and events that shaped an 'eco-navy' - from the first voyage into the Pacific to 'stop the bomb' to the risky mission to 'save the whales' to the struggles with money and ideology that accompanied success.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 21, 1981, after a decade of Greenpeace actions, we
sat in the Vancouver office and read a news report that an oil
consortium would bring a supertanker through Juan de Fuca Strait as
a "test" to show they could safely navigate to a proposed oil port
between Vancouver and Seattle. The next day, we announced that we
would launch a "test blockade."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Testing, testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Activist in inflatable in front of oil tanker." title="Patrick Moore participates in a 'test' protest against a 'test oil tanker navigation' to a planned oil terminal. The terminal was subsequently cancelled." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="67484"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;On
the following morning, January 23, we met the supertanker with a
flotilla of sailboats, launched a single Zodiac, and brought the
tanker to a halt. Media helicopters circled above. The US
coastguard arrested two of us. As we walked up the wharf,
handcuffed to each other, the television cameras closed in. "This
is just a test," I assured the reporters. "The handcuffs work fine.
We're going to test the food in the jails. The real protest will be
later."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tested the fingerprinting system, we had the Washington
State police laughing in the jail. They brought us dinner and said,
"Here, test this." The next day, the Seattle and Vancouver
newspapers ran pictures, and the test theme, on the front page. The
protest took three days. The Georgia Strait oil terminal was
cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This victory remained almost lost in Greenpeace lore, but it
embodied much of what made Greenpeace work throughout the 1970s
while confronting bombs, whalers, and sealing ships: quick actions,
at the precise point of conflict, providing a storyline and images
for the delivery system, the media. It borrowed from all our
mentors, Saul Alinsky, Gandhi, Dorothy Day, and Marshall
McLuhan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Make them laugh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was a fan of Chicago community organizer Alinksy
who advised, "Move with the action ... use humor." And we all knew
that Gandhi was not just about satyagraha; he created the right
image at the right time, such as his famous march to the sea to
make salt. Gandhi understood communication and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "test blockade" idea was a spontaneous reaction that made us
laugh, so we figured it would make others laugh. By 1981,
Greenpeace Zodiacs were old news, but the "test" theme provided a
storyline that was new. I remember laughing out loud as we sat
around planning the tactics. I think this is always a good sign.
Humor goes a long way toward easing the public's mind and disarming
the media's natural skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Zodiac between Russian whaling ships." title="Greenpeace zodiac manoeuvres itself between two Russian whaling ships. Harpooned whales are being transferred from catcher vessels to the factory processing ship." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="67562"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;By
1972, I had read everything published by media guru Marshall
McLuhan, and his idea that "we think and live mythically"
influenced our tactics. Although we employed good science, we
understood that the facts don't always win the public mind. When we
launched the whale campaign in 1974, I had a clear image in my mind
that I wanted to capture. At that time most people who thought
about whaling still held a nineteenth-century image: small men in
tiny boats hunting the huge leviathan. The reality of industrial
whaling was the reverse: giant factory ships and exploding harpoons
scouring the oceans with sonar for the last of the whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Moving images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Harpooned sperm whale." title="Harpooned sperm whale." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="67565"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;When
we found the whalers off the coast of California in June 1975, we
captured this new image. A photograph of dead sperm whale under an
ominous exploding harpoon mounted on the bow of a towering,
steel-hulled ship circulated the world. These images ultimately
changed the public mind, and the public outcry led to a whaling
moratorium by 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is a tremendous tool, like the printing press and
television before it, that democratizes knowledge and
culture-making. Some of the cyber-activist messages I witness on
the Internet today are brilliant, but the fundamentals of good
storytelling haven't changed much in two thousand years. We still
have to find those mythical images that touch the human
emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

	There's nothing nastier than a wounded tiger. ExxonMobil(Esso) is licking its wounds as Russia moves closer to ratifying the Kyoto protocol.  But the world's number one environmental criminal is still fighting tooth and nail to deny the truth about climate change. The US government is increasingly isolated and Exxon is out to ensure its workers keep it that way by voting for US politicians who oppose action against global warming.

            Exxon tells staff, retirees, and contractors how to vote in US presidential and congressional elections.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compliment corporate front groups, lawsuits against critics,
and tireless lobbying against any global warming regulation, Exxon
is stepping up its efforts to get employees to vote
"pro-business".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a story reported by the Dow Jones Newswire, Exxon
is mailing its 34,000 employees with election materials and helpful
voter guides which -- surprise! --give the Republican Party gold
star ratings for spurning global warming regulation, supporting
drilling for oil in the Arctic wildlife refuge, and letting oil
refineries release more pollution by weakening the Clean Air
Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon is informing not only its employees but also retirees and
contractors how they should vote in upcoming presidential and
congressional races across the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We obviously are promoting candidates who are pro-business and
candidates who recognize the importance of a viable policy on
energy," Ken Cohen, the vice president for public affairs and the
chairman of ExxonMobil's PAC, said. "Republicans more often tend to
line up on those issues than Democrats."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000 Exxon gave 91 percent (US$1.37 million) of it political
donations to the Republican Party. Exxon was more than amply repaid
when President GW Bush promptly withdrew the US from the only
global treaty to control global warming, the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message at ExxonMobils' &lt;a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com/cat/"&gt;Citizen Action Team&lt;/a&gt;
website, company CEO Lee Raymond states "it is essential that we as
a company, and more importantly as individuals, are part of the
political process." The website's front page quotes Thomas
Jefferson: "We in America do not have a government by the majority.
We have a government by the majority who participate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Exxon to Greenpeace: Stay away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=308563"&gt;
uncovered Exxon links to White House policymaking&lt;/a&gt;, we've &lt;a href="http://www.exxonsecrets.org/"&gt;exposed Exxon funding to front
groups debunking climate science&lt;/a&gt;. Greenpeace offices around the
world have taken direct, non-violent action to put the company's
war on the climate in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Exxon has secured court injunctions in several
countries to keep Greenpeace away from Exxon property. We're
actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do
likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso
properties! Under no circumstances should you go near any property
marked with an Exxon or Esso logo. To make sure we're all clear
about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a
message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away.&lt;/a&gt; Tell them
you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't
contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics
and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;Don't buy ExxonMobil. Don't buy Esso&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activities have a high profile around the world, but there is another important side to us that doesn't get as much coverage - our supporter networks. We have almost 3 million supporters worldwide, and without them Greenpeace wouldn't exist.

            Six year old Natalie Dolan sold her old toys to raise money for Greenpeace New Zealand, here she presents staff with her cheque.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supporters are our biggest secret - they are our
cyberactivists, volunteers, donors; they are young, old, rich, poor
from all walks of life and from all over the world. Our Supporter
Service teams are at the ready around the world, to support our
members with any queries about campaign related information,
sending out newsletters and instructions on how to bequeath money.
They are also ready to send back corporate or government money -
that is the kind of help we don't want or need!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team has speciality skills to deal with local issues - like
our team in Switzerland. They look after 143,000 members in three
different languages. Greenpeace International, Supporter Services
takes care of the membership service for supporters who live in
countries where we do not have an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Dedicated Supporters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" US student Cristina Page went to great lengths to give to Greenpeace." border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="67154"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Some
members of the public are determined to support us, no matter what
difficulties arise. For instance, when Cristina Page - a US student
studying in Luxembourg - met Damiano (part of the Direct Dialogue
team) she decided to donate 50 euros. Unfortunately, there were
complications with the bank transactions - but this didn't deter
her as her emails relate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I recently donated 50 euros to Greenpeace through one of your
representatives, Damiano, in Luxembourg. The donation was declined
through my bank account. I apologize for any inconvenience to
[Greenpeace] and wish to make amends as soon as possible. The
account is now current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I had a very positive experience with Damiano, who was very
patient and friendly, so please do not let my mistake reflect
poorly in his representation; he is a great asset to Greenpeace.
Please, please send me the bank transfer form... I will do WHATEVER
it takes to make sure you get the original donation... If I need to
pick up the form at your Luxembourg office, I would do that as
well, just let me know."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Starting Young:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent donation to the New Zealand office was from
six-year-old Natalie Dolan. She met a representative on the street
with her mother and was so impressed with what she heard that she
decided to raise some money for Greenpeace by selling her old toys.
With the help of two friends she organised the toy sale and raised
NZ$60.35. She recently visited the Greenpeace offices in Auckland
to meet the team and to present them with her cheque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Freedom to Choose:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katherine Y.M. Chan from Hong Kong recently found herself having
an argument with a man in a supermarket after explaining to her
daughter why she wasn't allowed Nestlé Ice Cream. The man
approached Katherine after overhearing her explanation and told her
that there was nothing wrong with eating Nestlé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The man made me angry and I responded, 'I am free to speak.
Everyone knows Nestlé produces GE food. Yes, I've been eating
Nestlé food for years, as my parents knew nothing about GE food.
Now I am a mother…I've got the right to choose for my daughter.'
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Katherine Y.M. Chan, Supporter of GP China, stood up for her right to choose GE free food." border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="66746"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The guy was shocked and said, 'you must be a member of that
silly Greenpeace. Otherwise, you will not have so many stupid
words.' I replied, 'Yes! So What? I guess you are a paid lackey of
that bad company!' At least my daughter can grow healthily since I
will not give poison to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many lady shoppers asked me what is GE food. I told them all I
learnt from Greenpeace. After listening to what I said, most of
them returned the Nestlé food in their shopping baskets back to the
racks. That's what I can do!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Out of the Blue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our supporter services teams never fail to be surprised by the
dedication of our members. Recently, Greenpeace Netherlands was
made the sole benefactor of Cor Muhlenfeld, a lady who had recently
passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone from Dutch social services contacted our supporter
services regarding this matter, they were very surprised. Mi'jke
Breteler from the team went to Cor Muhlenfeld's house - to find out
more about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that her home was a hoarder's paradise and hidden away
among her papers was a Greenpeace member card from 1979, the year
Greenpeace Netherlands was founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Looking through the agenda I found out she was a busy lady. She
had many friends who told me great stories about her; she worked in
an antique market where she sold old glasswork and she was very
fond of animals in general, and of Greenpeace. She was an artist
and her house was full of paintings," said Mi'jke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Here in the Greenpeace office we made a collage of a painting,
the member card and other personal things of Cor. Soon we will go
out to the North Sea with the Argus and some of her friends and we
will give her ashes to the sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Join Greenpeace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions. In order to ensure
that we remain an independent voice for the planet, we don't accept
corporate or government funds: we rely on the small donations of
millions of supporters. Greenpeace exists because this fragile
earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It
needs action. Please &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.com/donation/donate.php?theme=default"&gt;
help by becoming a supporter today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Are you sleeping on illegal Okoumé trees from the Congo? Is your kitchen table made from wood which has started social conflict in a distant African country? Are you literally flushing an ancient forest down the toilet? Check out our interactive Forest House to see exactly where your household goods come from and the forest-friendly alternatives.
&lt;div&gt;

            The Forest House - an interactive guide to the wood in your home
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth's ancient forests are unique, centuries old regions that support countless plant and animal species as well as native communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are rapidly vanishing as the demand for wood and paper grows. In fact, only 20 percent of the world's ancient forests remain - a very scary statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/foresthouse/"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25760/bedroom.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our comfy houses are contributing to the problem - in Europe, 50 percent of the tropical wood used in our furniture, doors and window frames is logged illegally, often from irresponsibly managed ancient forests. This wood often fuels corruption and social conflict and destroys the homes of endangered or undiscovered species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you know what wood you should and shouldn't buy? Can the same type of wood be both "good" and "bad" depending on where it comes from? And just how do you tell your Maple from your Merbau and your Birch from Bangkiria?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/foresthouse/"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25760/study.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our interactive &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/foresthouse/"&gt;Forest House&lt;/a&gt; is a room-by-room (and garden) guide to wood in household products, featuring everything from flowerboxes to guitars. You can also learn exactly why wood is "good" or "bad" and print out our one-pager to stick on the fridge and check before you make that trip to IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forest House also lets you search by product, so if you're on the lookout for a new hatstand or toilet seat, you'll know you should give teak a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the safest wood is always Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) certified. This means that the wood is from a sustainably managed forest and that the rights of indigenous peoples are respected during the logging process. Some homeware stores such as IKEA and Home Depot (in the US) have made commitments to only source FSC® certified wood for their products.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Where are the fish?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/where-are-the-pacific-tuna/</url><text>
	We thought the Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery was the last healthy tuna fishery in the world. Despite concerns about over-fishing due to the rapid expansion of the industrial fleets, the conventional wisdom was that the fishery was still in fairly good shape. After two months in the region we realised this assumption was very wrong.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Boys fish from a small boat in a Pacific atoll lagoon. Rampant industrial fishing threatens the future of Pacific fisheries and will mean an uncertain future for these children in an economy that relies on local traditional fishing for survival.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sailing the Western and Central Pacific, documenting
fishing, andspeaking with industry leaders, local fishermen,
academics andgovernment regulators we've realised that this is a
fishery on the edgeof crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Suva, Fiji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our journey of discovery began with our first stop, Suva, Fiji.
Therewe met Grahame Southwick, owner of Fiji Fish, and one of the
manyindustry leaders sounding the alarm: "We have a biological
problem,there are too many boats taking too many fish. It also
spawns aneconomical problem where we have legitimate fleets being
forced out ofbusiness by the pirate fleets or the non-conformists."
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A fisherman walking home with his catch of goatfish." title="A fisherman walking home with his catch of goatfish." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="65174"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Prime Minister of Fiji himself, Laisenia
Qarase,reportedly called for measures to ensure that tuna fishing
ininternational waters is harvested on a sustainable basis. He
alsocalled for more of the profits from fishing in the region to go
to thelocal economy: "More than 95 percent of its cash value goes
to othercountries. The return to the Pacific nations is under 4
percent of itsworth. Clearly, we must do something about this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Tarawa, Kiribati&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Kiribati we came across a long liner, our first
fishingvessel at sea, pulling in its line. The crew was friendly,
but we sawfirst hand an incident of &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/archives/001560.html"&gt;shark
fining&lt;/a&gt;.Shark fins are worth a lot of money, but shark meat is
not a big seller- so they kept the fins and threw the dead shark
overboard. What awaste. Government and industry experts advocate
using fishing line thatbreaks off when a big shark bites the line -
letting the shark live.But most fishermen don't like the idea of
losing a hook and many don'tlike the idea of losing that shark fin
revenue (some crew on fishingboats are even paid in shark fin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kiribati, the dilemma facing small island nations that want
toprotect their fish stocks, but are cash strapped, was highlighted
by &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/archives/001603.html"&gt;Johnny
Kirata&lt;/a&gt;,Deputy Director of the Fisheries Resources Department:
"As you can see,the resource itself is an important one, yet we
also have a governmentthat needs hard cash. There must be a balance
in trying to manage andconserve the resource, and at the same time
reap the maximum benefitfrom it." 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Johnny Kirata" title="Johnny Kirata" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="65990"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spoke to Ekueta Leremia, a successful local fisherman.
Heruns seven small fishing boats working with more than 20 staff.
As withthe other local fishermen we spoke to, he is worried about
how overfishing is hurting his livelihood: "Until 1980 it was a
very good timefor fishing, plenty fish around. You didn't need to
go very far out,just stay close to land and you could catch big
Yellow Fin. Now it'svery difficult, very difficult to get those big
ones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Mojuro, Marshalls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/archives/001626.html"&gt;public
meeting in the Marshalls&lt;/a&gt;,the Deputy Attorney General Posesi
Blommfield talked about thechallenges enforcing fisheries
regulations with a 1,321,220 square mile(2,131,000 sq km) area to
patrol with one patrol boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As you are all aware, it's one thing to have laws in place
tocombat IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), it's
quiteanother to prosecute them. The crime of IUU is quite different
to othercrimes, because it is hard to go out there and catch the
violators, itis hard to bring them in, it is hard to identify who
the owners are,and it is very hard to bring evidence in and present
it to a judge andhope that he will convict." 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Chinese fishermen off-load yellow fin tuna at a tuna packing plant." title="Chinese fishermen off-load yellow fin tuna at a tuna packing plant." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="65180"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;We
also visited Kolej, a local fisherman who has been around
longenough to remember the good old days. He put the blame for
decliningcatches on foreign fishing vessels. What he said was both
hopeful andsobering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think the possible solution now is for the governments of
thecountries in the Pacific Islands to work together to be firm
inprotecting their resources. If no action is taken, the livelihood
thatwe depend on will one day be depleted and the future
generations maynever see it real life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pohnpei we saw more fishing boats - purse seiners and long
liners -then at any other stops. The long liners unloaded into a
processingfacility right down the dock from us. The &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/archives/001648.html"&gt;purse
seiners&lt;/a&gt; transfer their fish onto reefer (refrigerator) ships
out in the lagoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had tea with some Chinese fishermen on board their long
liner.Like many fishermen, they endure cramped living conditions,
long hoursand years away from home at a time - for relatively
little in the wayof pay. A purse seiner captain was also kind
enough to allow us to comeon board, and document their transhipping
(transferring) fish to arefer (refrigerator) ship. Transhipping in
a harbour like this isacceptable because the authorities can
monitor it, but Greenpeaceopposes transhipping at sea because it
makes it too easy to evade theregulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Longline fisherman, on ship docked in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia." title="Longline fisherman, on ship docked in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="65996"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;One
industry leader on this stop, Milan Kamber, Managing Director
ofCaroline Fisheries Corporation and a long time purse seiner
captain,told us: "Our ships used to come in with 3-4000 tons (per
year), nowthey're barely coming in with 2000 tons. They used to
stay (at sea) amonth, or under a month, but now (it takes) up to 50
days, close to twomonths to finish the voyage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Sea searching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own experiences at sea have confirmed these concerns. We
haveencountered large numbers of purse seiners on the high seas
fishing fortuna without any regulation or controls - taking
advantage ofweaknesses in the law of the sea to fish for tuna as
they migratebetween the exclusive economic zones of the Pacific
Island States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine times in the past week we have set off in our small boats
tofilm purse seiners and long liners hauling their gear and speak
withtheir captains and crews. Two long liners caught only four fish
betweenthem in four hours from their 75km long lines. Five out of
six purseseiners hauled in &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/archives/001674.html"&gt;dismally
small catches&lt;/a&gt;,and the sixth wasn't much better. Skippers on two
other purse seinerswe visited complained of small catches and few
fish. Helicopter pilotstell us that these experiences are being
echoed all around us. 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Workers on a Taiwanese purse seiner trans-ship yellow fin tuna and skipjack tuna to a reefer (refrigerator) ship." title=" Workers on a Taiwanese purse seiner trans-ship yellow fin tuna and skipjack tuna to a reefer (refrigerator) ship." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="65171"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's not just the tuna that are threatened by over-fishing.
Ourdivers continually wonder why there are no sharks in the water
withthem as they film the purse seine nets being drawn, despite the
cloudsof blood and thrashing fish. View the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/pacific/slide-sea/index.html"&gt;slideshow
of purse seiners hauling their nets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the pacific tuna fishery is not in a
healthyrobust state. It is, in fact, over-fished and heading
steadily towardsthe fate suffered by some many fisheries in the
Atlantic and elsewhere.Catches are dropping, fish are harder to
find, and more boats keepcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What happens next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the picture is not all bleak. The alarm is being raised
by awide variety of stakeholders - from the artisan fishermen, to
industryleaders, to government officials - there is a strong
consensus thattime is rapidly running out for the fisheries.

poor governance and pressure from the far off nationsexploiting
these resources bring about another marine, ecological andeconomic
disaster? I don't know, but in the people of the Pacific thatI have
met on this tour, I have found reason to hope.&lt;/p&gt;

	Politicians deciding on rules for scrapping old ships got a timely reminder when a sculpture, made from the remains of ships taken from Indian shipbreaking yards, was delivered to delegates attending the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting in London.

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists deliver a sculpture made from the remains of ships taken from Indian shipbreaking yards to delegates attending the International Maritime Organisation in London.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sculpture was made from the funnels of five old ships, one
of which, the Greek owned Amina, exploded in the yard, killing nine
people and causing over a dozen serious injuries. The sculpture
serves as a reminder of the human and environmental toll caused by
current shipbreaking practices. The Amina exploded in Alang, India,
in February 2003 because it contained hazardous gas and other toxic
substances. However the Greek owner, Chandris, still refuses to
take any responsibility for not cleaning the ship before hand. Only
mandatory rules will help prevent tragedies like this in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMO sets legally binding rules for the shipping industry.
This week it will address the current practice of dealing with
end-of-life vessels. Even today old ships are being sent to Asia
and to other developing countries containing hazardous substances
which routinely risk the lives and health of local people and
destroys their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With this sculpture we want to make clear that this lethal
business of sending toxic ships to Asia and elsewhere without
cleaning them first must stop. Currently voluntary measures
proposed by the IMO will not protect the people or the environment.
Some ship owners and others in the shipping industry have told us
that they too want mandatory rules to provide a level playing
field. We call on the IMO to establish a legally binding regime to
deal with this business, which is a form of waste trade," said
Ramapati Kumar, from Greenpeace in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships sent for scrapping often contain substances such as
asbestos, PCB's and oil known to damage human health and the
environment. In addition the presence of other substances, such as
fuel or gases in tanks increases the risk of explosion and other
accidents putting the safety of workers at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship owners currently continue to send vessels for breaking
full of hazardous substances, which would normally not allowed to
be traded according to the international waste trade laws. We
believe that unless the ships are decontaminated prior to their
arrival at shipbreaking yards, the shipping industry is, in
practice, breaking established principles of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know current voluntary proposals are not enough to prevent
pollution or to improve the dangerous working conditions in
shipbreaking yards. Effective prevention of pollution takes place
only when hazardous substances are removed from end-of-life
vessels. This needs to be mandatory and consistent with
international waste trade laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting ended Friday with agreed guidelines that &lt;a href="http://greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news56.asp"&gt;fall short
fully cleaning up the ship breaking business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a delegation of people involved in shipbreaking in Asia
toured Europe to call for an urgent solution to the environmental
and health problems associated with the industry. Read about &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item%5fid=282523"&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Athens 2004 disqualified from Green Olympics</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/athens-disqualified-from-green/</url><text>
	The Athens Olympics may boast gold, silver and bronze medals this summer - but green medals will be nowhere in sight despite Greece's promises of making the 2004 Olympics the greenest ever.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/7/despite-greece-s-promises-of-m.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/7/despite-greece-s-promises-of-m.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Despite Greece's promises of making the 2004 Olympics the greenest ever - they are even less environmentally friendly than the Sydney Olympics
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all heard the promises, so how come the Athens Games make
few, ifany, concessions to environmental protection and don't
highlight anygreen solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Athens was still a candidate city, the official position of
theGreek authorities was clear and straightforward, according to
its bidthe "Olympic Games are a challenge as well as an opportunity
for thebroad implementation of programs and actions which are
environmentallyfriendly and in accordance to the principles of
sustainabledevelopment...projects will be realized with the use of
environmentallyfriendly technologies and materials, and this will
be a prerequisite inall relevant tenders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such promises conjure up images of solar panels, recycled
andnon-toxic building materials however it seems they were just
pipedreams. With the exception of public transport, which has
shownimpressive improvements due to the Olympics, the environmental
recordof the Athens Olympic Games is very poor. Athens will undo
much of theprogress on environmental issues made for Sydney
2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item item_id="64727" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" title="Solar panels being installed at Sydney Games" alt="Solar panels being installed at Sydney Games" hspace="4"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Our
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/archives/olympics/index.html"&gt;campaign
for the Sydney Games&lt;/a&gt; to be the first green games was
instrumental in ensuring the 2000 Games &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/archives/olympics/winslosses.html"&gt;
showcased and promoted solutions&lt;/a&gt;to environmental problems. The
solar powered athletes village was theworld's largest solar suburb
and was later sold as public housing.Solar powered venues meant
lower costs and less global warmingpollution. The reduction in use
of PVC plastic in buildings showed thatthere are practical
alternatives to this poison plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our major victories was the &lt;a href="http://www.cokespotlight.org/"&gt;Coke Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;campaign,
which saw Olympic sponsor Coca-Cola meet our demands for anew
refrigeration policy to reduce its impact on global climate
change.The online campaign included downloadable stickers and
letters to Coke.Only one month after the website went live,
Coca-Cola committed tophasing in climate friendly refrigeration. We
also targeted Unileverand McDonald's as part of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/extra/?campaign%5fid=4012&amp;amp;forward%5fsource%5fanchor=Greenfreeze&amp;amp;item%5fid=9207"&gt;
Greenfreeze campaign&lt;/a&gt;launched back in 1992. Instead of using
global warming chemicals,Greenfreeze fridges use natural gases so
avoids both depleting theozone layer and fuelling global
warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few environmental bright spots of Athens - the fact
that Olympic sponsors, Coca Cola, McDonald's, Unilever, have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=504623"&gt;
now committed to using Greenfreeze&lt;/a&gt; is down more to our campaign
and pressure from online activists than the Athens Games
organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Environmental failings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the lack of green commitment in Athens is even more
shocking.Green energy is the most striking failure for the Athens
Olympics. Itwas the intention that all electricity used by related
premises andusers during the Olympics in 2004 should be generated
by renewables.For a country that markets it self as a country of
endless sunshine,solar energy for the games shouldn't be so
difficult. But green energyat the Games is close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This list of failures in the environmental performance of
theAthens 2004 Olympic Games shows that when there is no strong
politicalwill, failures will override wins. Athens is well behind
Sydneyregarding the environmental performance of the Games. The
distance fromenvironmental excellence and sustainability is so big
that Athens isdisqualified from this race," said Nikos
Charalambides of GreenpeaceGreece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Olympics Committee (IOC) has the
responsibility toensure the Olympic Games have a minimum impact on
the environment andleave a positive legacy for those hosting the
Games. The GreekGovernment had the power, money and time to set the
standards andensure that the Green Olympics become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they have proven themselves short sighted and have
aimedfor the absolute minimum. Public authorities have shown a high
level ofindifference, incompetence and lack of action. The world is
the loserat these games.&lt;/p&gt;

	Over 22,000 people and a wide-ranging collection of public interest organisations presented a Declaration for a Toxics Free Future to European Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom. The Declaration calls on the European Commission to protect our health and environment from hazardous chemicals in future EU chemicals law now under review.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            On behalf of coalition, two children present European Commissioner Wallstrom with Declaration for a Toxics Free Future
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protected by Toxics Ted, a large teddy bear who defends children
against toxic chemicals, Clara Leetz, 6, and Leila, 7, handed the
Declaration to Commissioner Wallstrom, underlining the concerns
about the risks to children and babies, who are the most vulnerable
to the effects of hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the European Consumers' Organisation, the
European Public Health Association, Women in Europe for a Common
Future, World Wildlife Fund, European Environmental Bureau, Friends
of the Earth and Greenpeace joined together at the event to present
the Commission with the list of demands for greater chemicals
control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of organisations - environmental, consumer, health and
women's groups - demonstrates the wide-ranging impact of the EU's
future chemical legislation and its relevance to people's daily
lives. The Declaration was also supported by organisations
including the Netherlands' Council of Women, the German Childbirth
Association, and the British Allergy Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People and wildlife are already contaminated with man-made
chemicals. 300 man-made chemicals have been found in the bodies of
people that have had no special exposure to chemicals. The
chemicals crisis is at such proportions that the unborn baby faces
exposure from the moment of its conception. House dust and
rainwater contains many hazardous chemicals that are found in
consumer products and that we use every day, including body
products, detergents, electronic goods, toys and textiles. So great
is the number of chemicals all around us that we are constantly
exposed to multiple doses - the combined effect of which could be
affecting our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate declaration in favour of the European Commission's
new legislation on chemicals, signed by more than 10,000 US
citizens, has also been submitted by over 60 US organisations
(including the Communications Workers of America and The Breast
Cancer Fund). This is because the European Commission's new
legislation on chemicals offers a real opportunity to begin
controlling the spread of chemicals. Europe is the world's largest
chemical producer, so what happens here could lead to better
chemical legislation around the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievably, only a handful of chemicals have been assessed for
the risks they pose and even then, little effective action has
resulted. And many chemicals are still widely used even when they
are known to be hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given our understanding of the way chemicals interact with the
environment, you could say we are running a gigantic experiment
with humans and all other living things as the subject" said one of
the authors of a recent report by eminent UK scientists (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Declaration asks the European Commission to ensure that its
new legislation on chemicals includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an obligation to phase out and substitute chemicals that
accumulate in wildlife, humans or the environment, and those that
disrupt hormones;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a full right to know, for both consumers and businesses,
including what chemicals are present in products;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a requirement that products imported into the EU have to
conform to the same safety standards as those made in the EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were pleased that Wallstrom viewed our demands as legitimate
and welcomes our input in the Commission's current internet
consultation process. Now the European Commission needs to act to

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Gallon had a brilliant career as an environmentalist, with
the Society for the Promotion of Environmental Conservation (SPEC),
the Environmental Liaison Centre in Nairobi, at Pollution Probe,
and later with the Ontario government. He is probably most well
known lately for The Gallon Environment Letter, a widely
distributed environment and business e-newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gallon's formal involvement with Greenpeace was limited
to the early days in Vancouver, when he loaned us our first "real"
office space, his work and ours overlapped and complemented each
other at various points over the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, Gary Gallon received the Canadian Institute for
Business and Environment's Life Time Achievement Environment
Award.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EU, don't cave in to US corporate agenda on GMOs!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-don-t-cave-in-to-us-gmo-ag/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace urges EU Trade Ministers to defend universal right to say No to GMOs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We gave two sacks of soy contaminated with Monsanto's genetically engineered (GE) varieties to Pascal Lamy (EU Trade Commissioner) and asked him to send them back to his US counterpart, Robert Zoellick. The right to say no to genetically engineered (GE) food should be available not just to Europeans, but to everyone around the world. We urge the EU to stand strong at the WTO meeting in Cancun in September, and not cave in to US pressure on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are a biosafety issue, not a trade issue.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/7/eu-trade-commissioner-pascal-l.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy receives from Greenpeace Italy Genetic Engineering campaigner Federica Ferrario sacks of soy contaminated with genetically engineered (GE) varieties by the US-multinational GE company Monsanto.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From field to fork, the food we eat and the seeds we plant in
our fields are being targeted by multinationals, which are
attempting a corporate take-over of the entire food chain. They are
seeking to reduce everything to a trade issue, including
environmental and social concerns, which are brushed aside as
unfair trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the EU has just adopted the world's strongest rules
on the labelling of GMOs. To the GE industry and its backers in the
Bush Administration, the rules are a threat to their plans to
force-feed the world GMOs, because they not only help to identify
and exclude GE ingredients in Europe, but also serve as model
legislation for other countries planning to regulate GMOs. The US
is, therefore, challenging the EU's GMO policy through the WTO and
is expected to broaden its complaint against the EU's GMO
moratorium, to include opposing the EU's new GMO labelling
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By bringing this complaint, the US is also trying to use the WTO
to override crucial environmental agreements, like the first
legally binding global agreement that allows countries to reject
GMOs, the Biosafety Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When EU trade ministers next meet at the WTO ministerial meeting
in Cancun in September, they need to make the US understand that
GMOs are not an issue for the WTO to regulate. Instead, action
needs to be taken to implement and strengthen the UN Protocol on
Biosafety, which will enter into force during the Cancun meeting.
The Biosafety Protocol represents a much-needed tool, especially
for developing countries wishing to ban or restrict GMO
imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urge the EU Trade Ministers to recognise that protecting the
environment and people from the hazards of GMOs is not a trade
issue but a biosafety one," said Frederica Ferrario, Greenpeace
genetic engineering campaigner in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

	The "yellowcake" sample we delivered to Paul Bremer, head of the US civil administration in Iraq, is safely contained - but who knows how much is still left unsecured and unsafe in the local community.  We brought  Mr Bremer a container of the radioactive uranium found abandoned near the Tuwaitha nuclear facility and urged him to allow the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out a full survey and decontamination of Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace delivers a container of radioactive uranium'yellow cake  found abandoned in the community outside the Tuwaitha nuclear facility, to Mr Bremmer, head of US civil administration in Baghdad.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving outside the Office of Rehabilitation and
Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) - now located in one of Saddam
Hussein's palaces in Baghdad - we challenged Mr Bremer to accept
responsibility for the "yellowcake" and for the rest of the
radioactive material that is contaminating the environment and
threatening public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Administration insists there is no danger or health risk
to the villages, despite evidence of widespread radioactive
contamination in the area, after the facility was left unsecured at
the end of the war and was subsequently looted. Authorities allowed
the IAEA into Tuwaitha last month, but only to make an inventory of
uranium inside part of the nuclear facility, not in the surrounding
communities. They were refused permission to inventory any of the
400 highly radioactive sources known to have been at Tuwaitha
before the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been surveying the villages around Tuwaitha for
the past three weeks and has found frightening levels of
radioactivity including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge uranium "yellowcake" mixing canister with about 4-5
kilos of powder still inside, left open and abandoned on a field
near a village&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;radioactivity in a series of houses, including one source
measuring 10,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another source outside a 900 pupil primary school measuring
3,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;locals who are still storing radioactive barrels and lids in
their houses&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a smaller radioactive source abandoned in a nearby field&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;consistent and repeated stories of unusual sickness after
coming into contact with material from the Tuwaitha plant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;numerous objects, carrying radioactive symbols, discarded in
the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

None of this nuclear material is prohibited by UN resolutions or is
usable for nuclear weapons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community near Tuwaitha is suffering a nuclear disaster that
would be tolerated nowhere else in the world. Even the US
military's own radiation expert in Iraq agrees that a major
decontamination and health screening programme is urgently
needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would recommend the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
and the World Health Organisation get involved and do an
assessment. They've got involved in other instances like in Brazil
where sources have ended up being distributed in the community and
they actually assessed the risks from that. The faster it happens
the better," said Lt. Col Mark Melanson, radiation expert and head
of the US Military Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine unit in
Iraq, in a Greenpeace interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we we spoke with Dr Emad Aldin, Health Physicist, Iraq
Atomic Energy Commission, he agreed: "To deal with this crisis and
to solve this problem and pass through this mess we need all the
help from the United States as the occupying force, and the
international organisations like the IAEA and the WHO. If these
efforts are united that will solve the problem as quickly as we
hope."&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activists deliver 15 barrels of fake radioactive waste to the doors of the European Parliament
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists delivered 15 barrels of fake radioactive
waste to the doors of the European Parliament. Nuclear power is
being promoted at the heart of Europe's new Constitution. Rolling
an outdated and undemocratic treaty into future EU law is not just
inappropriate - it's dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be the perfect chance for Europe to build a bright new
future. A future powered by renewable, clean energy sources like
solar and wind power. Nuclear free and fossil fuel free. A future
where real commitments are made to halting climate change by
phasing out fossil fuels. Where carbon dioxide emissions produced
when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are burnt, are
significantly reduced and nuclear fuel is not advocated as a
'clean' alternative. Where the legacy of nuclear waste is addressed
and the myth of safe nuclear power is exploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable as it may be, Europe is in fact close to enshrining
nuclear power at the heart of its new Constitution. Valery Giscard
d'Estaing has proposed that the outdated, undemocratic and
dangerous 1957 Euratom Treaty is included in the new
Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on the Future of Europe is holding its final
talks on the draft Constitution in Brussels. Mahi Sideridou of
Greenpeace said "It's now up to Convention members. They can either
bow to Giscard and let him have his way or stand up to him and say
no to nuclear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although numerous individual Convention members have demanded
the deletion of the Treaty from the text that is now being
finalised, they are being ignored by the Praesidium, the ruling
body of the Convention on the Future of Europe that produced the
draft text. There has not even been a full plenary discussion on
this fundamental issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace energy spokesperson, Stefan Schurig, said "This
treaty is entirely inappropriate to the times and in no way
reflects the actual circumstances in the EU today". Six EU
countries have never produced nuclear power, while four others have
decided to phase it out and Italy has already completed its phase
out. On 12 March this year, the German Bundestag called for the
Euratom Treaty to be allowed to expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the European Union doesn't stand up to Giscard, it will be
required to promote nuclear power and the nuclear industry will get
preferential treatment - institutional and financial. It's hard to
see how this fits with the fundamental principles of sustainable
development and fair competition that requires a level playing
field for all energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is feared that nuclear power projects will get additional
funding, for example, through the European Investment Bank because
the proposal would make the European Atomic Community an integral
part of the future European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The experience of the last fifty years has shown that nuclear
power is a source of incalculable dangers of huge proportions and
that the ever-increasing mountains of nuclear waste cannot be
safely disposed of anywhere in the world", added Stefan Schurig. If
nuclear power is supported by the European Constitution, it will
set Europe back decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Convention fails to resolve this threat, then it will be
up to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to do so in October at
the next phase of the Constitution process.&lt;/p&gt;

	For many local people, the need for water storage overrides the unseen threat of radioactivity.  We took clean water containers into the communities around the Tuwaitha nuclear facility near Baghdad and encouraged people to swap them for their radioactive ones, contaminated with uranium "yellowcake".
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A resident of Al Wadiyah carries home a clean water barrel which Greenpeace activists exchanged  for radioactive ones.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a US$3 a barrel offer from the US Army, many in the
community have retained the contaminated containers. Of the 500
barrels looted from the nuclear site since the war, about 150 are
still unaccounted for. A new barrel costs US$15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The affected people are not organised criminals but the poorest
of the poor, living in chronic poverty after years of neglect and
abuse at the hands of Saddam's regime and a decade of crippling
sanctions. We hope that by offering new barrels specifically
designed for water storage that we can return the last of the
contaminated barrels to the US military for safe-keeping inside the
Tuwaitha site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small Greenpeace radiation sampling team has been working in
the community living near the Tuwaitha nuclear facility for only
two weeks and has already uncovered frightening levels of
radioactivity there, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge "yellow cake" mixing canister, with approximately 4- 5
kilos of uranium inside, abandoned on open ground near a village,
which the team returned to the US radiation experts inside Tuwaitha
plant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;radioactivity in a series of houses, including one source
measuring 10,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another source outside a 900 pupil primary school measuring
3,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;locals who are still storing radioactive barrels and lids in
their houses&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another smaller radioactive source abandoned in a nearby
field&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;several objects carrying radioactive symbols discarded in the
community&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;consistent and repeated stories of unusual sickness after
coming into contact with material from the Tuwaitha plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

None of the material found can be used for conventional nuclear
weapons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupying forces claim responsibility for public health but
have refused to allow the experts - the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) - to carry out a public health and environmental
assessment around Tuwaitha and in other parts of the country. They
insist there is no threat to public health, which is clearly not
the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence we gathered in a very short time shows that
radioactive contamination could be spread throughout the Tuwaitha
environment, affecting a large number of people. This threat must
be taken seriously and a serious investment made into assessing the
true extent of the radioactive contamination and impact on public
health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAEA should be given a full mandate to search, survey and
decontaminate towns and villages around the Tuwaitha as quickly as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24th June, Lt. Col. Melanson of the US military stationed at
the Tuwaitha nuclear site accepted our delivery of radioactive
waste and said: "I would recommend the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organisation get involved and do
an assessment. They've got involved in other instances, like in
Brazil, where sources have ended up being distributed in the
community and they actually assess the risks from that. The faster
it happens the better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuwaitha nuclear storage facility, south of Baghdad, was
left unsecured by occupying forces after the fall of Saddam Hussein
and was heavily looted. In contrast, oil pipelines and the oil
ministry were immediately secured. Just days after the cease-fire,
British Museum officials were brought in to reclaim stolen
artifacts. It was nearly two months before IAEA inspectors were
allowed to return.&lt;/p&gt;

	Rock star Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders fame) hoisted a fifteen metre banner over the stage and invited the audience in Valencia to meet her at the Rainbow Warrior. Representatives of the local socialist party joined her on board, presenting an initiative that would require the regional government to use timber certified as sustainably harvested.  Meanwhile, activists from countries including Argentina, Mexico, France, Sweden, and the US demonstrated outside their respective Spanish embassies.  Their collective goal:  free the Rainbow Warrior, and protect the ancient forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/6/the-greenpeace-flagship-rainbo-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior boarded  by approximately 50 agents of the Spanish Civil Guard riot police in the port of Valencia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While timber extracted from the world's last remaining forests
enters harbours in Spain and around Europe, the Rainbow Warrior is
held at bay. Authorities in Valencia detained our flagship after a
non-violent, peaceful protest against the importation of illegal
and destructive timber over ten days ago. The Spanish Government
has demanded a bond of Euro 300,000 in exchange for the ship's
freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 13th, Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the
cargo ship Honour, which transported the contentious timber.
Because of this protest the Captain of the Rainbow Warrior, Joel
Stewart, and four other activists have been ordered to pay a fine
totaling Euro 630.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish authorities have also opened a case against the
Rainbow Warrior. "Not since the French response to Greenpeace's
protests against the nuclear tests in Muroroa, has Greenpeace seen
this kind of repression," said Joel Stewart. "The Spanish
Government should be going after the real criminals who are
destroying the world's forests and not challenging the democratic
right of peaceful protest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new European Commission Action Plan on Forest Law
Enforcement Governance and Trade does not adequately reflect the
severity of the illegal logging issue and falls short on the very
important point of implementing new legislation to ban the trade in
illegally harvested timber. Spain plays an important role in
stopping the trade in illegally harvested timber and should focus
its energy and resources on implementing proper legislations to
protect the lungs of the planet and not in persecuting people with
evidence and facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of the world's last ancient forests robs local
peoples of the resources needed for their survival. We are
campaigning to protect the world's remaining ancient forests by
promoting ecologically sustainable and social responsible forest
use and the establishment of protected areas. Protected forest
areas are dedicated to the conservation of their biological
diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and
are established and managed respecting traditional land
rights--particularly those of indigenous peoples. They are
protected from road building and industrial activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Take action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help the Rainbow Warrior get back to the business of protecting
forests, and &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=825&amp;amp;s=forest_skin"&gt;tell

	The European Parliament has adopted the world's toughest rules on the labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), despite  intensified pressure from the US and the GE industry. The new rules bring great news for EU consumers, farmers and food producers - all food and animal feed containing GMOs must now be clearly labelled. (In the US and Canada all such freedom and information is currently denied.) It will also now be possible to trace products from the field to the fork.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/7/tougher-eu-gmo-regulations-mea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Tougher EU GMO regulations mean consumers will know what they are eating.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules are a slap in the face for the US, which is doing
its best to forcefeed the world genetically engineered food after
heavy lobbying from biotechnology multinationals like Monsanto. The
Bush government's bully-boy tactics include waving the WTO stick -
the US is challenging the EU's policy on GMOs under the WTO's
dispute resolution process, thereby also threatening to undermine
the Biosafety Protocol. The Biosafety Protocol is the first legally
binding global agreement that allows countries to reject GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU public has been massively opposed to genetically
engineered food, since the first shipment of GE soya arrived in
Europe in 1996. And it shows no signs of decline, with European
consumers consistently rejecting GE food. Until now though, EU
labelling rules had too many loopholes to really keep GE products
out of the shopping basket, since thousands of products, such as
oil, starch, and animal feed, didn't have to be labelled. This is
about to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the new rules are certainly a huge step forward, there
are still some significant loopholes. These include the fact that
EU consumers still won't be able to tell whether meat or dairy
products come from animals fed with GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern is that EU member states will not be obliged to
act against the contamination of conventional or organic
agriculture with GMOs. They "may", rather than "shall" take action
to prevent neighbouring farms from being contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GE industry is continuing to play around with exactly how
much contamination would require labelling. They want an upwardly
creeping threshold that will undermine the reliability of the label
and keep the doors open to further invasion of GE crops in the
future. We're therefore calling for measures to prevent any genetic
contamination in seeds, with legally binding anti-contamination
measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE producers like Monsanto should also be financially liable for
potential losses that farmers suffer as a result of genetic
contamination. Seems reasonable, doesn't it? But in the US and
Canada, it's the producers who are suing the farmers! In once case,
Monsanto sued a Canadian farmer for failing to enter into an
agreement to pay royalties when pollen from a neighbouring farm
drifted and propagated on his rape (canola) field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Preventing genetic contamination should now be the number one
priority for the EU. If nothing is done to protect conventional and
organic crops from genetic contamination, the new labelling system
will actually be at risk of becoming useless after a few years
because it will be increasingly hard to secure GMO-free supplies,"
says Eric Gall, Greenpeace's EU Advisor on genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer antipathy towards GMOs remains entrenched in the EU and
will determine the market. Only recently the British Retail
Consortium (BRC), representing 90% of high-street shops in the UK,
made clear that 'supermarkets are not going to give shelf space to
something that doesn't sell.' A recent Greenpeace survey among food
companies in Germany showed that 170 out of 216 companies asked for
produce without any GE ingredients. Only 18 companies do not want
to exclude GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	In the eight months since the Prestige spilled an estimated 12,000 tonnes of oil, Greenpeace has been active, demanding an accelerated ban on single-hull tankers, a scale-back in the use of oil worldwide, and a tightening of loopholes that allow dangerous rust buckets to sail under flags of convenience. Today the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which is charged with protecting the health and safety of our seas, leapt into action with their response: they  kicked Greenpeace out.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A oil cleanup volunteer holds a Comorant covered in oil from the sunken Prestige oil tanker on the coast of Galicia, Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a move sponsored by, among others, Cyprus and Australia, the
Chair of the forty-member UN body removed Greenpeace's decade-old
observer status without a vote. Cyprus along with co-complaintant
Turkey are among the "flag of convenience" states which have met
criticism from Greenpeace for their willingness to license
substandard and dangerous oil tankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move threatens to evict a non-governmental organisation
dedicated to the protection of the world's oceans from a United
Nations body which is, ummm, dedicated to the protection of the
world's oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remaining inside the IMO with consultative status are such
industry lobby groups as Intertanko, the industry association of
supertanker owners. This despite the fact that supertanker oil
spills such as the Exxon Valdez, the Erika, and the Prestige have
been responsible for environmental, economic, and human
catastrophes the world over. The interests of these groups,
however, will continue to be heard by the IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the façade of noble purpose, the IMO is in fact
financially dependent on the tanker industry. The dues paid by each
country are determined by the tonnage of their respective fleets,
which makes the large flag of convenience countries - Panama,
Liberia, Greece, Cyprus, and others -- the largest contributors; in
turn the oil companies often pay these dues and will even represent
these countries directly at the IMO. Longtime Greenpeace
representative Rémi Parmentier said "I remember once a Panamanean
delegate with a double sided business card: one side saying Panama
Consulate and the other one saying 'Exxon Legal Office, NY.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges against Greenpeace Maritime protest. The complaint
from Turkey notes that in July of 2002, activists chained
themselves to various parts of the oil tanker "Crude Dio" and hung
a banner reading "STOP THE OIL INDUSTRY. CLEAN ENERGY NOW!"
Australia noted that Greenpeace had protested ships carrying
genetically modified soy beans and shale oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipping industry has been trying to brand Greenpeace
actions as "dangerous" for years, despite the fact that the real
dangers are the cargoes such as oil, plutonium, and toxic wastes
which we take action against. In the 2002 Annual Report of the
shipping industry lobbyists Intercargo, the group raised the
spectre of a potential "tragedy" that might result from "protestors
in small boats" and the prospect of a "nautically naïve activst
attached to an anchor cable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety is parmount to Greenpeace at all times. Our activists are
thoroughly trained, our nautical standards and expertise have
earned the respect of coast guards and maritime specialists around
the world. Unlike the oil industry, we don't put other people's
lives or the environment at risk with our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has
called for a strengthening of the role of civil society at all
levels of the UN, removing Greenpeace from the IMO simply
demonstrates the unfettered powers of the oil industry and
multinational corporations in today's world. As the doors of the
IMO close to all but the corporate dealmakers and backroom
politicos, Greenpeace will continue its fight to protect our oceans
and its struggle against unsafe cargoes. This fragile earth
deserves a voice. The IMO has a duty to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Over one million tonnes of oil were spilled into the world's oceans during the 1990s
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 14th, the Tasmin Spirit, a 24-year-old Greek oil
tanker, spilled 15,000 tonnes of crude oil across a 14 kilometre
stretch of the Karachi coast. 13 million people live in Karachi,
and the wind is wafting dangerous petroleum fumes over the
city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace supporter from Karachi writes: &lt;i&gt;"[The] ship has
leaked out thousands of tonnes of crude oil which has spread all
over the major beaches and coast line. If immediate efforts are not
made this disaster will spread on the entire coast line of Pakistan
and in to other neighbouring countries. This has already created a
disaster for the marine life killing thousands of sea animals
already including hundreds of rare species including lobsters, sea
horse, jellyfish. The stinky smell is so strong that the adjacent
areas of the entire coastline have become inaccessible for
living.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;People including small children and
senior citizens are having severe respiratory and digestion
problems including vomiting, diarrhoea and other ... diseases."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another supporter writes: &lt;i&gt;"People living near the beaches
have caught up severe throat infections. Just yesterday some
students in a school became unconscious and the government finally
had to close down all the schools near the beaches. The affects do
not end here - soon you will hear a lot of family-suicides in those
same oil-covered waters by the fishermen that have become jobless
and already have nothing to eat."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated 90,000 fisherman are without work now as the crude
oil has devastated the local fisheries. Turtle hatcheries on the
southern coast and myriad aquatic life in the region are threatened
not only by oil, but by the chemical dispersants being sprayed to
try to contain the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean up operations have begun, but as with the Prestige oil
spill which is now estimated to have spilled 63,000 tonnes of oil
along the Galicia coast in Spain, and the Exxon Valdez disaster in
Alaska, which spilled 38,800 tonnes, the ecosystem will take years
to recover. &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994100"&gt;New
Scientist reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Spanish coast may take a decade to
return to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many people and too many ecosystems have suffered from
deadly oil spills. The only answer is to move toward a clean energy
future and phase out the world's deadly addiction to oil. We can't
undo the environmental devastation that's been visited on the
Karachi coast, but we can do something to reduce oil consumption
and prevent future spills. That means implementing the Kyoto
agreement on reducing Greenhouse gasses, and taking immediate
conservation steps.&lt;/p&gt;

	Australia, home of the Great Barrier Reef, is the last nation on Earth that you'd expect to be knowingly destroying coral habitats. But that's just what will happen if the state of Queensland approves an expansion in shale oil operations -- unless you help stop them.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Climate change is threatening coral reefs worldwide.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs around the world are suffering from climate change.
As the climate heats up so do the oceans, causing the organisms
that give coral its colour and food to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is mostly caused by burning fossil fuels such as
oil, coal and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that without a significant reduction in fossil fuel
emissions coral reefs could disappear in less than 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this problem is Australia's world famous Great
Barrier Reef, which lies off the state of Queensland. At around
2000 kilometres long it is the world's largest reef. But unless
projected levels of climate change are slowed, much of the reef
will be dead in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the reef experienced its worst ever case of coral
bleaching, with over 60 per cent being affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this threat is being highlighted by the proposed expansion
of Southern Pacific Petroleum's Stuart Shale Oil project near
Gladstone in Australia - just off the southern end of the reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the second stage of the project is waiting to be
accepted or rejected by the Queensland government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of a shale oil industry would more than double
Australia's greenhouse emissions - increasing climate change. This
would spell disaster for the reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will make its decision within the next few
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can help the Queensland government make up its
mind to reject the project.&lt;/p&gt;

	Mexicans are being forced to swallow Monsanto's seeds of destruction, while back in the US, Monsanto is not allowed to grow its genetically engineered (GE) cotton for fear of GE contamination. To expose this double standard our activists blocked a trainload of GE contaminated maize as it crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico.
&lt;div&gt;

            Activists intercept a trainload of US maize as it tries to enter Mexico.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just a case of double standards - the US administration
continues to ride roughshod over the rights of people around the
world to say no to genetically modified organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific analysis shows that one third of US maize
entering Mexico is contaminated with GE varieties from Monsanto.
Mexico is the centre of diversity of maize, one of the world's
three most important food crops and it's at serious risk from GE
contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teosinte, for example, is the wild relative of maize. Recent
scientific research from the US found that genes from GE crops
could rapidly take over those in wild relatives like teosinte. When
most of the wild populations of teosinte are already under threat,
contamination from escaped GE maize could push them over the
edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the US and Monsanto have no scruples in dumping their GE
maize into Mexico, even though, back in the US, Monsanto is not
allowed to grow its GE cotton in the South of Florida, because of
concerns about contamination of related cotton species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international agreement, the Cartagena, or Biosafety
Protocol agreed in January 2000, clearly states that countries must
take action to prevent adverse effects of GE crops on the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liza Covantes, our campaigner in Mexico said, "Mexicans are
being forced to swallow the destruction of our number one food
source, and the health and environment of the people who depend on
it, because governments around the world stand back and allow the
US to force their trade and biotechnology corporations' interests
on other countries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world are allowing big business to use
trade rules under the World Trade Organisation (WTO), to force
crops like GE maize on smaller countries. The US government has
already used WTO rules to force countries such as Sri Lanka and
Bolivia to accept GE food and is currently aiming to force Europe
into accepting their GE giant's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We wouldn't need an international agreement if the likes of
Monsanto and the Bush administration had the best interests of the
Mexican people at heart. But that doesn't mean the US can ride
roughshod over people and environments across the globe just
because they think that governments will let them get away with
it," Covantes added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only through international agreements like the Biosaftey
Protocol that countries can protect the health of their people and
the environment, and, for example, say no to GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican and other Governments must stand by the agreements
already in place to ensure that the environmental protection
prevails over corporate interest and at the upcoming WTO meeting in
Mexico in September.&lt;/p&gt;

	Agent Orange should be a cautionary tale from the past. Containing some of the most toxic chemicals known to man it was sprayed it over huge areas - creating a toxic legacy for those people exposed. The Spolana factory in the Czech Republic produced Agent Orange before poisoned workers forced production to be shut. However the factory still produces lethal poisons - just a different type.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The factory on the banks of the Elbe River is one of the most
contaminated sites in the world due to the past production of Agent
Orange. Production of chlorine and PVC at the plant has also lead
to contamination on surrounding land, food and in the bodies of
local people. Mercury pollution, regular explosions and leaks of
chemicals endanger residents of the local town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant owners refuse to accept responsibility for
contamination from the plant and claim the pollution must be the
fault of those contaminated. We have been touring the chemical
plants of the Elbe River for three weeks to highlight the risks to
local people of outdated plants producing toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These toxic dinosaurs have no place in a modern Czech Republic
and if the Czech Government is to soon join the European Union (EU)
that a big clean up is required to meet EU standards. We will be
there to ensure these standard are met and polluting plants like
Spolana are not allowed to get away with spreading these
poisons.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace cordoned off the UN building in Montreal, to protect it from the US attack on consumers, farmers and the environment. Activists at the Greenpeace checkpoint were on the lookout for representatives of the US administration and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, who are trying to undermine countries' rights to reject or ban genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists dressed as security guards confiscate a bag of genetically modified organisms from 'George Bush'.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush Administration, and the transnational genetic
engineering and agro-chemical industries that back Bush, are using
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to try and force open new
markets for their products. These 'new frontiers' are in Asia,
Latin America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real battle has just begun. The US, supported by Canada and
Argentina, launched a pre-emptive strike by filing a complaint in
the WTO against the European Union's new comprehensive GMO
labelling laws. With this complaint, the US also targets the global
agreement that effectively secures the right of countries to ban or
severely restrict imports and the use of GMOs - the Biosafety
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biosafety Protocol enables governments in the South to
resist political coercion on the basis of the precautionary
principle. (1) Applying this rule, countries can ensure that the
protection of biosafety and biodiversity (particularly agricultural
biodiversity), comes before the expansion of corporate agribusiness
and the vicious cycle of dependency that this involves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last decade the US, Canada and Argentina have tried
desperately to prevent the Biosafety Protocol from becoming a
reality. The Protocol was agreed in the UN building in Montreal and
is due to come into effect on the first day of the WTO meeting in
Cancun, on 11 September, 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Darier, Greenpeace genetic engineering campaigner in Canada
said "The presence of the WTO in Montreal for this informal
mini-ministerial is a bad omen for people and the environment. It
is the duty of all countries to ensure that the already
well-established major international agreements to protect people
and the environment do not become casualties of a corporate driven
agenda pushed by the WTO which promotes trade at any cost over
sustainable development."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastien Risso, Greenpeace EU advisor for trade issues in
Montreal said, "The WTO is increasingly proving to be an
undemocratic and non-transparent political tool used by big
business to erode the environment, public health and consumer
rights. Given the clear WTO bias, which favours trade
liberalisation over other legitimate policy goals, the WTO is now
facing a severe legitimacy crisis and therefore must be prevented
from further expanding its mandate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What is needed now is a thorough assessment of the rules
governing the global trade system, and substantial reform, which
frees people from forced trade. The world needs a strong
multilateral system in which peace and sustainability hold primacy
over narrow corporate interest and national egoism,"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risso concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Where there is the potential for serious or irreversible
threats to health and the environment, action can be taken on the
basis of the precautionary principle to avoid such threats, even
where definite proof of harm does not yet exist. Precisely the case
of genetic engineering that involves such broad threats and whose
harmful impacts could be severe and irreversible. Find out more

	Greenpeace activists replaced the World Trade Organisation (WTO) sign at its headquarters in Geneva with a new logo, "World Transgenic Order", denouncing the WTO for promoting the corporate interests of the genetic engineering (GE) industry.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists replaced the World Trade Organisation (WTO) sign at its headquarters in Geneva with a new logo,
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Greenpeace activists representing consumers were shoved into straitjackets by Uncle Sam, who dumped genetically engineered (GE) maize on them. This is exactly what the US would like to do - dump GE food on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right of consumers to say no to GE food is under threat from the US, heavily influenced by its GE industry. The US is trying to use the WTO to challenge the European Union's ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The EU has also recently adopted the strictest GMO regulations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US challenge amounts to a scare tactic to "encourage" countries to open their markets to genetically engineered (GE) food. Many countries fear that if they reject GMOs, they will be met with huge trade sanctions (which could be worth hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars) in the WTO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO is an inappropriate and incompetent body to deal with environmental issues such as GMOs, that can have a major impact on the environment and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting that the US chose to file the WTO complaint right before the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety ("Biosafety Protocol"). It is widely believed that the Biosafety Protocol is the ultimate target of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Biosafety Protocol, the majority of countries now commit to the "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/trade-and-the-environment/the-precautionary-principle/"&gt;precautionary principle&lt;/a&gt;", on the basis of which they can regulate and reject GMOs on the ground that they may pose a threat to the environment and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the US complaint against the EU, many countries may be afraid to implement the Biosafety Protocol rules. As a result, the Biosafety Protocol could be less powerful at best, and at worst, irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Heinzer, Greenpeace GE Campaigner in Switzerland said "The internationally endorsed precautionary principle must not be over-ruled at the expense of promoting corporate interest and survival of the GE industry, in serious trouble because of the spreading market rejection of GE products. It is vital that the world governments secure their ability to adopt restrictions on GMOs, including introduction of bans, labelling systems and measures to eliminate genetic contamination."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Iceland resumes whaling</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stop-icelandic-whaling/</url><text>
	Iceland announced a few days ago the resumption of its "Scientific Whaling" programme. We have turned our flagship "Rainbow Warrior" around to do something about it.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/8/minke-whale-balaenoptera-acu.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/8/minke-whale-balaenoptera-acu.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Minke whale, (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior first sailed against Icelandic whaling on
her maiden voyage, in 1978. We are now returning to support local
groups who also fear the announcement by Iceland's Ministry of
Fisheries is a first step towards a resumption of commercial
whaling. In fact, the &lt;a href="http://www.fisheries.is/"&gt;Ministry
of Fisheries website&lt;/a&gt; openly declares that Iceland wants to
resume commercial whaling in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was heading toward Greece when Iceland
announced that a hunt for minke whales this year. She'll arrive in
Icelandic waters in two weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leipold said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whaling is part of Iceland's past, and must remain so. Some
people of Iceland will regret this because whaling was so much a
part of their life. Whilst we don't expect to change everyone's
minds, Greenpeace hopes that we are able to give many Icelanders
the confidence to say no to whaling - forever. A clear message must
go to the Icelandic government - globally, as well as directly from
the people of Iceland - that this will not be tolerated. Iceland
can make more money from whale watching than whale killing and
should be doing all it can to protect those whales in its
seas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;No science justifies killing whales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does a resumption of "scientific whaling" mean we can expect
better data about the new threats to whales from climate change and
shifting ocean currents? Will it mean a better understanding of why
minke whales in the North Atlantic are contaminated with mercury?
Will it mean new data to test the recent evidence that original
whale populations have been vastly underestimated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. All it will mean is more dead whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No science justifies the killing of whales. This is simply an
underhand attempt by the Icelandic government to resume commercial
whaling." said Gerd Leipold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Commercial whaling by the back door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) in 1982, but a loophole allowing the killing of
whales for research purposes has been exploited by several
countries as a cover story for their commercial whaling
programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While denying that they have a commercial interest in hunting
whales, the Icelandic Fisheries Ministry all but apologises at its
&lt;a href="http://www.fisheries.is/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the fact that it
is &lt;i&gt;"obliged"&lt;/i&gt; to sell the products of its scientific whaling
programme under IWC regulations and international law. Iceland
hasn't always been so worried about international law: they have
conducted illegal hunts in the past, but have chosen to put a more
respectable adverb on their activities, in preparation for a return
to full-scale commercial whaling in 2006. They're under internal
pressure to do so: the Icelandic Tourist Association demanded that
the government not undertake any whaling programme unless it's
legal, and Iceland's recent rejoining of the IWC appears to be part
of a strategy to silence critics at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Excuses, excuses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as Icelandic Ambassador Helgi Ágústsson puts it in his
automated response to a Greenpeace Cyberaction: "The annual
consumption of fish, krill and other biomass by whales in this
region [Iceland's 200 mile economic zone] has been estimated around
6 million metric tons, several times the total Icelandic fishery
landings of 1.5 to 2.0 million metric tons."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's all about fish, and how whales are eating more than
their share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang about. Have a look at that figure: the Fisheries Minister
has lumped "Krill and other biomass" into the tonnage consumed,
neither of which are particularly sought-after delicacies for the
Icelandic dinner plate or export market. If you read carefully
through the materials presented by Iceland, you might raise the
question of exactly how many fish the whales are consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, says Iceland, is exactly why they need to kill whales:
to study how much fish they are eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Unecessary, irrelevant science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the IWC's Science Committee failed to approve the Icelandic
"scientific programme" when it was submitted to their recent
meeting. And US Commission delegate Rolland Schmitten said the plan
was "not relevant science; it's not necessary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of non-lethal means of studying whale
interactions with the ocean food chain, and according to the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1802578.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;,
Australian scientists have perfected a new humane way of assessing
fish consumption. They sample whale poop instead of popping whales
with harpoons and slicing open their stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the study's principle scientist, Nick Gales, "We
will be telling the International Whaling Commission that this is a
robust, non-lethal method for studying whales."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's going to provide some real information to put into food
web models. If it points out that whales are competing for fish
stocks, then we'll have to deal with that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can we do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help concerned Icelanders stop the Iceland's Fisheries
Department from taking a foolish step. If the Fisheries bureaucrats
are worried about Iceland's "long term prosperity," they really
ought to look at how commercial whaling will damage their
economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland has been an increasingly popular tourist magnet, and a
burgeoning Whale watching industry has taken hold. More than
277,000 people visited Iceland in 2001. That's almost more than the
entire population of the island. It's estimated that in that year,
one third of those visitors went whale-watching. According to &lt;a href="http://www.enn.com/news/2003-06-05/s_4794.asp"&gt;ENN,&lt;/a&gt; a
dozen firms have sprung up in Iceland over the past decade,
generating around US$8.5 million in revenue in 2001. Commercial
whaling brought in US$3 million to US$4 million annually between
1986 and 1989, when commercial hunts were stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Icelandic Tourist Association voted in April of this year to
strengthen its stand against whaling. One whale-watching village
hung its flag at half mast when the Fisheries Ministry made its
unpopular announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, the &lt;a href="http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=0BAD61D3-389D-4B87-BE6C345224BCF616"&gt;
Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; reports that the US Government has expressed
"extreme disappointment" at Iceland's "unnecessary" lethal
research. The US will review options for trade sanctions against
Iceland under the Pelly Amendment, which mandates that the US State
Department take action against countries which are undermining
international agreements to protect endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody higher up in the Icelandic government ought to be
running a cost calculation of the relative value of a renewed
whaling industry against lost tourism revenues, trade sanctions,
possible fishery or tourist boycotts, snubs by trendy British
clubbers who have been frequenting Iceland's shores lately, and a
redirection of tourist dollars away from Icelandic whale watching
to other, whale-friendlier shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help Iceland do the right thing. &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/stop-icelandic-whaling-2"&gt;Tell
Icelandic officials to stop whaling now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;In reply to your letter you will
most likely receive an auto reply trying to portray the Icelandic
position in a 'fair and balanced' way. Refer back to this article
and the references above to see the real reasons why Iceland is
resuming whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

            Activists deliver a sculpture made from the remains of ships taken from Indian shipbreaking yards to delegates attending the International Maritime Organisation in London.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sculpture was made from the funnels of five old ships, one
of which, the Greek owned Amina, exploded in the yard, killing nine
people and causing over a dozen serious injuries. The sculpture
serves as a reminder of the human and environmental toll caused by
current shipbreaking practices. The Amina exploded in Alang, India,
in February 2003 because it contained hazardous gas and other toxic
substances. However the Greek owner, Chandris, still refuses to
take any responsibility for not cleaning the ship before hand. Only
mandatory rules will help prevent tragedies like this in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMO sets legally binding rules for the shipping industry.
This week it will address the current practice of dealing with
end-of-life vessels. Even today old ships are being sent to Asia
and to other developing countries containing hazardous substances
which routinely risk the lives and health of local people and
destroys their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With this sculpture we want to make clear that this lethal
business of sending toxic ships to Asia and elsewhere without
cleaning them first must stop. Currently voluntary measures
proposed by the IMO will not protect the people or the environment.
Some ship owners and others in the shipping industry have told us
that they too want mandatory rules to provide a level playing
field. We call on the IMO to establish a legally binding regime to
deal with this business, which is a form of waste trade," said
Ramapati Kumar, from Greenpeace in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships sent for scrapping often contain substances such as
asbestos, PCB's and oil known to damage human health and the
environment. In addition the presence of other substances, such as
fuel or gases in tanks increases the risk of explosion and other
accidents putting the safety of workers at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship owners currently continue to send vessels for breaking
full of hazardous substances, which would normally not allowed to
be traded according to the international waste trade laws. We
believe that unless the ships are decontaminated prior to their
arrival at shipbreaking yards, the shipping industry is, in
practice, breaking established principles of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know current voluntary proposals are not enough to prevent
pollution or to improve the dangerous working conditions in
shipbreaking yards. Effective prevention of pollution takes place
only when hazardous substances are removed from end-of-life
vessels. This needs to be mandatory and consistent with
international waste trade laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting ended Friday with agreed guidelines that &lt;a href="http://greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news56.asp"&gt;fall short
fully cleaning up the ship breaking business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and health problems associated with the industry. Read about &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item%5fid=282523"&gt;

	In a move unprecedented in its history, the US government has indicted an entire organization - Greenpeace USA, Inc. (the Greenpeace entity in the US) - for the peaceful protest activities of its supporters.

            Greenpeace opposes illegal mahogany shipments into the US.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;The protest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, several miles off the coast of Florida, two
Greenpeace activists boarded the Jade - a ship carrying wood
illegally exported from the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists made it clear by their appearance, words and
actions that they were engaged in a peaceful effort. The fact that
the activists had "Greenpeace" on their boats and clothing helped
to reassure the crew of the Jade that the people coming on board
were peaceful and safety conscious. When they boarded the ship,
using a ladder hanging from its side, they brought with them a
banner reading, "President Bush: Stop Illegal Logging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading3special"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pannelbody"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/bin/view.pl/10048/action_id/195.html"&gt;Tell the US Government to prosecute illegal loggers, not Greenpeace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;US Government response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of intercepting the contraband and prosecuting the
smugglers, the US government is going after Greenpeace. Making this
the first time in history that the US government has prosecuted an
entire organization for free speech related activities, and they
are trying to do it without a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;In context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists off the coast of Miami were continuing a long US
tradition of protest and civil disobedience. This tradition
stretches back to include the civil rights movement, women's
suffrage and the Boston Tea Party. Plus, they were essentially
acting as whistle-blowers - publicly exposing, and trying to
prevent, the importation of illegally harvested mahogany wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their action was a small, but important, contribution to a
global effort - which helped prompt an agreement, at an
international conference that November, to give mahogany greater
global protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its work on this issue, Greenpeace received praise from the
European Union, and the government of Brazil... And now a landmark
indictment from the US government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Charges and what's at stake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- One violation of U.S.C. section 2279, which prohibits persons,
"not being duly authorized by law for the purpose," from "[going]
on board any vessel about to arrive at the place of her
destination, before her actual arrival, and before she has been
completely moored".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- And one count of conspiracy, under 18 U.S.C. section 371, to
commit this offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential fine, of $10,000 USD per charge, is serious money
for an organization that doesn't accept corporate or government
donations. The organization could also receive up to five years of
probation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing government monitoring, if sentenced to probation, would
make Greenpeace's role as a watchdog and advocacy group difficult,
to say the least. But it is the legal precedent that could be most
damaging for Greenpeace and other advocacy groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial part of what Greenpeace does is the exercise of its
right to free speech in calling attention to environmental
problems. A tactic this protest exemplifies: In an effort to help
save the Amazon, activists engaged in a very public direct
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a conviction in this case could have a chilling
effect on the ability of Greenpeace, and other groups, to
effectively criticize powerful corporate and government targets on
social and environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled to take place this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

routine act of civil disobedience until, 15 months after the
incident, federal prosecutors in Miami indicted Greenpeace itself
for authorizing the boarding. The group says the indictment
represents a turning point in the history of American dissent."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Italian seeds contaminated with GE maize</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/italian-seeds-contaminated-wit/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Scandal highlights loopholes in new European legislation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Over 100 farmers in Northern Italy have discovered that non-genetically engineered (GE) maize seeds that they bought and planted, were in fact contaminated by GE maize. The fact that cases like this are happening on a regular basis, raises serious questions - such as how are the seeds getting contaminated in the first place? Is it part of a deliberate strategy by companies selling GE seeds?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/greenpeace-marks-a-maize-field.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace marks a maize field with  signs showing corn with a 'question mark' indicating that 1 in 200 maize crops  can be genetically contaminated if the draft EU seed directive is passed .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 400 hectares of GE contaminated maize will soon flower, so
government officials and farmers leaders in the Piemonte region are
meeting to work out what to do with the maize to stop further
contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contamination came to light after routine seed tests by the
Italian authorities - unfortunately conducted after the seeds had
been planted. Although the exact details of what happened have yet
to be made public, local reports and previous experience suggest
that GE varieties produced by Monsanto may be the source of the
contamination. Farmers reportedly bought the seeds from the company
Pioneer Seeds that not only sells conventional non-GE seeds, but
also acts as a sales agent for Monsanto's GE seeds in many
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full investigation must be conducted not only of the
contamination in Piemonte, but of what appears to be Monsanto's
policy of deliberate contamination of non-GE seeds and farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Federica Ferrario ask "With such cases
happening on a regular basis the question has to be asked whether
this is gross negligence or whether contamination of conventional
seeds is part of a deliberate strategy of companies who sell GE
seeds. In either case, legislation and legal action are required to
make those responsible pay for the costs associated with their
contamination and to prevent more such contamination in the
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming less than one week after new EU legislation on labelling
and traceability of GE food and animal feed, this case highlights
two of the major loopholes still existing in European legislation
and already acknowledged by many EU governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is one thing to have good labelling laws in place which make
sure food products and animal feed are labelled if they do contain
GE ingredients, but if Monsanto and its sales agents such as
Pioneer Seeds are allowed to continually contaminate normal non-GE
seeds, then that will make an absolute nonsense of the new
legislation because it will entirely deny any choice for farmers or
for consumers", added Ferrario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation is urgently needed to prevent seed contamination and
ensure strict liability for the GE company responsible when
contamination does occur.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finland resumes its destruction of old-growth forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finland-forests/</url><text>
	Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland.  The vast majority of Finland's valuable old-growth is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus.  Metsähallitus' logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value - including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            September, 2003, logging in Sami area
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being involved in a 'dialogue' process with two environmental organisations (WWF and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too - friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there's a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland's three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on customers of Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will entering their supply chain, pending comprehensive agreement on additional protection for these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin to switch all virgin fibre in their supply chain to sources that have been independently certified, at least to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Iceland has begun whaling again after 14 years.  Surely such a retrograde decision must mean Iceland is a rogue state when it comes to the environment, a home of barbaric rapers of the Earth?  Not so, says Rémi Parmentier in the concluding chapter of a three-part journey back in time. From his voyage with Greenpeace in 1978 through his experience in the 90s of working with Iceland in international fora, Parmentier brings his unique perspective to bear on Iceland, the environment, and whales.

            Crewmember Pete Bouquet paints the Rainbow Warrior, 1978
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long after my long-haired hippy voyage to Iceland as an
anti-whaling crusader, I had the privilege of working with
representatives of Iceland at a number of international fora, and
often their contributions to environmental protection was
remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s for example, Greenpeace was campaigning for the
elimination of persistent organic pollutants, a large group of
toxic substances that concentrate in cold sea-water environments,
contaminating fish, marine mammals and other species (including
humans). A major international environmental treaty known as the &lt;a href="http://www.pops.int/"&gt;POPs Convention&lt;/a&gt;, adopted in 2001 in
Stockholm, finds its origin in a speech that was prepared by two
Icelandic officials, Dr. David Egilsson and Magnus Johanneson, at a
meeting of the Governing Council of the UN Environment Programme
(UNEP) that I attended in 1995 in Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, it can be said that it was thanks to Iceland acting in
coalition with Ireland, Denmark and Norway, that in June 2000 it
was decided that the continued discharge and emission of
radioactive wastes from the nuclear reprocessing plants at
Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France) were inconsistent with the
international treaty that regulates marine pollution in the North
East Atlantic, known as the &lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/"&gt;OSPAR
Convention&lt;/a&gt;. There is mounting evidence of high concentrations
of radioactive Technitium-99 and other radionuclides discharged at
Sellafield and La Hague in seaweeds, shrimps and other marine life,
which corroborates Greenpeace concerns expressed since the 1970s.
This pollution moved up along the coasts of Denmark, Norway and up
towards Iceland; thanks to the determination of these three
countries(and notwithstanding fierce opposition by France and the
UK), the OSPAR Commission adopted a legally-binding Decision
calling for dry-storage of radioactive fuel, the &lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/zip/SZ20030910-113936-5179/document.zip"&gt;
non-reprocessing option.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, France and the UK, who did not vote in favour, have
continued to discharge reprocessing radioactive wastes, but the
OSPAR Decision sponsored by Iceland and others was nevertheless
important. Thanks to that decision, France and the UK have lost
their number one argument: they can no longer say that discharging
these radioactive wastes is in line with international
environmental law and policy, and countries such as Iceland who
oppose these discharges have gained the moral high ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland was also traditionally a strong voice at the UN's
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) pushing for the total
prohibition of radioactive and industrial waste dumping from ships
at sea (a goal that was promoted by Greenpeace for many years and
eventually &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25797/odhistory.pdf"&gt;
adopted in 1993 by the Parties to the London Convention on ocean
dumping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ban on ocean dumping is very effective; to the best of our
knowledge, since 1993 no ship has been sent out to deliberately
dump radioactive wastes at sea. Even the Russian Federation, which
keeps moaning that it would rather start dumping at sea again, have
had to abide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland also supported the Greenpeace view openly at meetings of
the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) when we demanded
that the countries shipping high-level radioactive wastes,
irradiated nuclear fuel and plutonium by sea be held liable and
forced to inform neighbouring coastal states in advance. Last but
not least, when in 1995 Greenpeace occupied the controversial Brent
Spar decommissioned offshore installation to prevent it from being
dumped in the Atlantic, Iceland was one of the countries which
understood Greenpeace's message: if Shell and the UK were let off
the hook with this first dump, perhaps hundreds more would follow
(thereby raising safety problems for trawlers, potential sources of
pollution and the broader issue of industrial responsibility).
Iceland supported a call for a moratorium on the dumping of
offshore installations, which led three years later to a unanimous
&lt;a href="http://www.ospar.org/measures/decisions/od98-03e.doc"&gt;Decision&lt;/a&gt;
by coastal states to prohibit permanently the dumping of
decommissioned offshore installations at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all large fishing countries, Iceland is facing a crisis and
many challenges of course. But when I used to represent Greenpeace
as observer at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), I was also
impressed to see the Icelanders actively campaigning for the
elimination of government subsidies to fishing fleets. Current
industrial fishing practices, particularly in the European Union,
have little to do with free and sustainable trade, because the
governments are using taxpayers' money to increase the efficiency
of fishing fleets or maintain them afloat artificially, with
devastating effects on the environment and the sustainability of
developing countries whose resources are being ravaged by the big
commercial fleets. Together with New Zealand, Iceland has led the
charge at the WTO since at least 1999 for the elimination of
fisheries subsidies, and this is a good thing, even if not
everything is perfect with these two countries' own fisheries
practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Towards an End to the Misunderstanding?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of Greenpeace includes a patchwork of missed
opportunities and misunderstandings with different communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the best interest of the industrial sectors we were
taking on to promote the image of Greenpeace as an organisation
that goes after a nation or a community rather than after a
specific unsustainable practice. And - truly -- this perception was
also sometimes exacerbated by our own mistakes and lack of
diplomatic or pedagogic skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Greenpeace's difficult relation with France from the
1970s to the mid 1990s when we were campaigning against nuclear
testing is probably the most extreme example. Yet, once the nuclear
testing campaign ended (i.e. when French nuclear testing ended and
a nuclear test ban treaty was adopted in Geneva) Greenpeace's and
France's mutual relations became more rational, to the extent that
President Jacques Chirac at a recent meeting with French NGO
representatives was heard saying, in relation to the issue of
illegal logging in West African forests, that he was "closer to the
position of Greenpeace than that of his own administration".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I held a meeting in Reykjavik with an Icelandic
Environment minister (it must have been in the spring of 1990, to
discuss marine pollution policy issues), I was asked to come to his
office in the evening after all the staff would be gone, so that
no-one could see us. Fortunately, this meeting served to break the
ice, because since then, I have never been asked to come at odd
hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday night in the winter of 1995, Clif Curtis - a
former Greenpeace political officer - and I were drinking beer in a
bar in downtown Reykjavik when a couple of young Icelandic women
sat at our table and asked us what we were doing in the country.
When I said that we were participating in a United Nations
conference on marine pollution hosted by the Icelandic government,
they thought it was great, but as soon as Clif told them that we
represented Greenpeace at that conference, the two women yelled at
us so much (It was not their first beer of the night)that we had to
leave quickly and find another bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I felt very sad when I realised what had happened
to these young Icelandic women: in 1978 when we first came to
Iceland with the Rainbow Warrior, they could not have been more
than 5 years old at most. And I could imagine them being children
and hearing many dinner conversations, many TV news shows, and many
classroom lectures, where people were talking about a group of
foreigners on a boat out there trying to deprive Iceland of their
whale resources. When a country has no enemy its leaders like to
create some to keep people together (ask George Bush). This was
what had happened to these two young women, and to Iceland at
large, with Greenpeace. For 25 years an entire generation has been
brought up in the belief that Greenpeace was a fierce enemy of
their nation. What a waste!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was writing this paper, I saw on the Internet that the
Rainbow Warrior has been greeted in Iceland by a group of kids
making a provocative whale meat barbecue alongside. There are
powerful forces gearing up now in Iceland to resume commercial
whaling. Some of those forces are interested in damaging the
relationship of Greenpeace with Iceland for another entire
generation. Watch out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;This is Part III of a three-part
series by Rémi Parmentier, a crew member on the first voyage of the
Rainbow Warrior, which took Greenpeace to Iceland to confront
commercial whaling there for the first time in 1978. Rémi has
worked for Greenpeace in different capacities for 27 years,
specialising in international environmental policy and treaties.
Recently he formed with Kelly Rigg, another Greenpeace veteran, &lt;a href="http://www.vardagroup.org/Design/"&gt;The Varda Group for
Environment and Sustainability&lt;/a&gt;. The views expressed in this
article are Rémi's; they do not necessarily reflect all aspects of
Greenpeace's current policy.&lt;/p&gt;

	Over 22,000 people and a wide-ranging collection of public interest organisations presented a Declaration for a Toxics Free Future to European Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom. The Declaration calls on the European Commission to protect our health and environment from hazardous chemicals in future EU chemicals law now under review.

        &lt;p&gt;
            On behalf of coalition, two children present European Commissioner Wallstrom with Declaration for a Toxics Free Future
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protected by Toxics Ted, a large teddy bear who defends children
against toxic chemicals, Clara Leetz, 6, and Leila, 7, handed the
Declaration to Commissioner Wallstrom, underlining the concerns
about the risks to children and babies, who are the most vulnerable
to the effects of hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the European Consumers' Organisation, the
European Public Health Association, Women in Europe for a Common
Future, World Wildlife Fund, European Environmental Bureau, Friends
of the Earth and Greenpeace joined together at the event to present
the Commission with the list of demands for greater chemicals
control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of organisations - environmental, consumer, health and
women's groups - demonstrates the wide-ranging impact of the EU's
future chemical legislation and its relevance to people's daily
lives. The Declaration was also supported by organisations
including the Netherlands' Council of Women, the German Childbirth
Association, and the British Allergy Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People and wildlife are already contaminated with man-made
chemicals. 300 man-made chemicals have been found in the bodies of
people that have had no special exposure to chemicals. The
chemicals crisis is at such proportions that the unborn baby faces
exposure from the moment of its conception. House dust and
rainwater contains many hazardous chemicals that are found in
consumer products and that we use every day, including body
products, detergents, electronic goods, toys and textiles. So great
is the number of chemicals all around us that we are constantly
exposed to multiple doses - the combined effect of which could be
affecting our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate declaration in favour of the European Commission's
new legislation on chemicals, signed by more than 10,000 US
citizens, has also been submitted by over 60 US organisations
(including the Communications Workers of America and The Breast
Cancer Fund). This is because the European Commission's new
legislation on chemicals offers a real opportunity to begin
controlling the spread of chemicals. Europe is the world's largest
chemical producer, so what happens here could lead to better
chemical legislation around the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievably, only a handful of chemicals have been assessed for
the risks they pose and even then, little effective action has
resulted. And many chemicals are still widely used even when they
are known to be hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given our understanding of the way chemicals interact with the
environment, you could say we are running a gigantic experiment
with humans and all other living things as the subject" said one of
the authors of a recent report by eminent UK scientists (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Declaration asks the European Commission to ensure that its
new legislation on chemicals includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an obligation to phase out and substitute chemicals that
accumulate in wildlife, humans or the environment, and those that
disrupt hormones;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a full right to know, for both consumers and businesses,
including what chemicals are present in products;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a requirement that products imported into the EU have to
conform to the same safety standards as those made in the EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were pleased that Wallstrom viewed our demands as legitimate
and welcomes our input in the Commission's current internet
consultation process. Now the European Commission needs to act to
ensure that its new legislation on chemicals will protect human
health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	Michelle Benjamin is a publisher at Raincoast books - a book publishing and distribution company on the West coast of Canada.  They publish in a range of genres, both fiction and non-fiction - but most famously the Canadian editions of the Harry Potter books.She's in Europe for the Frankfurt book fair (the largest in the world).  On the way, she stopped by the Greenpeace office here in Amsterdam, and took time to answer some of our questions about publishing and the environment...

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Michelle Benjamin, a publisher at Raincoast books.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;First, what tangible benefits have there been from printing the Canadian edition of Harry Potter on recycled paper?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printing the Harry Potter book in Canada, we printed it on 100%
post consumer recycled paper, and there've been a number of
achievements at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, in our company, it's brought a lot of enthusiasm to
people's jobs. People are very excited to be part of a project, a
book and a campaign that makes them feel good about their work and
what they're doing - and makes them feel like they're contributing
to a larger global initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the public and public awareness, because we printed
just over a million copies of this book in Canada it means that
over a million children, and adults, are reading this book and
seeing the statement by J.K. Rowling inside the front cover about
protecting the world's forests and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the environment, it means we've been able to not
destroy approximately 40,000 trees - and also see a number of other
environmental savings in terms of water usage and creation of
waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also contributed to a larger initiative in Canada, across all
of the publishers, to eliminate the use of ancient forest paper
from our production process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Have there been any challenges or obstacles to using recycled paper?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there've been many challenges. There are still challenges.
The three main challenges that we've identified and had to work
with are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of the paper. When we started this initiative
three years ago there were no book quality recycled papers, ancient
forest friendly papers, available. So we had to work with paper
mills to create and develop those papers, and work with our
printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality was another issue. The first papers that came out of the
mills were inconsistent in their quality, and they just didn't look
and feel the way quality book papers need to look and feel. A few
years ago, recycled paper tended to be quite grey, and dirty and
you'd have flecks. But that isn't the case any more. You can get
really, really fine, high quality recycled papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And price was a significant obstacle. It remains an obstacle.
These papers, because it's a new process, because they're producing
them in smaller quantities then regular papers, their prices just
aren't as competitive as the more traditional stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is, as the campaign continues and demand increases -
not just in Canada but across the world - that prices will become
more competitive. And we've already seen that happen in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Your company uses printers, who do the paper sourcing.  So, going back three years to before you began this initiative, you didn't really know where the paper pulp was sourced.  When you found out, did it come as something of a surprise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it did. And I think that's true for some of the other
publishers in Canada as well. I think publishers generally are a
very socially aware community and environmentally aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we just hadn't given enough thought to that part of the
process. There certainly were surprises. Surprising to realize that
almost all of the papers we were using were from 100 percent virgin
stock from not certified, not FSC, not sustainable sources. So that
was surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we have started looking at the supply chain for
materials, not just for our book production but across all our
business practices, it's been quite a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;What can regular consumers do to support book publishers who are using ancient forest friendly paper?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things. One, they can be aware that these
campaigns are happening, and look for the information printed on
the books that says whether it's printed from a recycled stock or a
FSC certified stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when they do see that they can, certainly buy the books, but
they can also let the publishers and the booksellers know that they
are doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most publishers have a website, with email access. It makes a
big difference when we hear from the general public that they have
seen those notices, and that it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Then &amp; now: Iceland, Greenpeace, and whales, Part II</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iceland-greenpeace-and-whale-2/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;By Rémi Parmentier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Iceland enjoys a rugged, natural beauty that can only be appreciated fully by seeing it. It also hosts a people who are fiercely proud of their largely pristine and clean environment. So why, after 14 years, has the Icelandic government bowed to internal pressure and begun whaling again?  Has nothing changed since long-haired Greenpeace hippies took to the high seas in the late 70s?  Rémi Parmentier takes us on Part II of a three-part journey back in time.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/9/crew-of-1978-greenpeace-voyage.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rémi Parmentier, lower left, in 1978 aboard the Rainbow Warrior
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are at war (even a non-violent "war" against the
whaling industry), you don't win every battle, or every aspect of
it. We certainly won the overall whaling war in the 70s, even if
today Iceland and Japan are still using a "scientific whaling"
loophole to hunt Minke whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is regrettable, however, is that - on the way - we
sacrificed our relationship with the Icelanders. Even if I can say
today that we have nothing to be ashamed of -- far from it -- I can
also say that we could have been smarter. We were just learning the
tricks of a new form of campaigning as we were inventing them, and
despite our mistakes we made a lasting mark on the history of
whaling, and accelerated its progressive elimination. It is just
too bad that Greenpeace lost a potentially strong ally - the
Icelandic people -- in the "war" against whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit Iceland, you will discover a land with a sky that
is clearer than in any other European country, and with people who
have adapted wisely to a harsh environment. They have harassed
geothermal energy, put hydrogen cars on the street, and, unlike the
US and Russia, ratified the Kyoto Protocol. They value the
preservation of their environment, no less than other modern
nations, and have done more to defend that environment than
most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Greenpeace campaigns against Iceland's whaling unified her
people in a view of Greenpeace as an enemy, an anti-Icelandic
force. We saw world opinion as our best weapon against whaling, and
played to that, ignoring the need to respect and work with the
people of Iceland themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;It is all about perceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did we really "sacrifice" our relationship with Iceland? To
talk to people in the streets of Reykjavik, or anyone who followed
the whaling conflicts over the past decades, you'd expect
Greenpeace and Iceland to be sworn enemies, dueling with bared
teeth at any opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A crewmember paints the Rainbow Warrior, 1978" title="A crewmember paints the Rainbow Warrior, 1978" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53308"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
that's not the picture if you scratch below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as the 70s, we were pointing toward an economic
opportunity that has since yielded rich rewards. On first visiting
Iceland we proposed that the whaling industry could be replaced by
a whale-watching industry for tourists. Living whales can bring as
much money, or more, and for longer, than dead whales, we said in a
genuine attempt to change the mind-set. Like all visionary and
ground-breaking thoughts, it was a laughable one at the time, and
we were treated like weirdos: the weather in Iceland was not suited
to taking tourists out to sea, they said; this was not the Canary
Islands or the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was pleasantly surprised the last time that I visited
Reykjavik, in 1998, to see that there was a flourishing whale
watching industry in the country. On hotel reception shelves, the
old post cards of the Hvalur whaling station were replaced by post
cards showing whale watchers taking pictures of living whales
blowing on the surface of the sea. Whereas in the 1970s, tour
operators would take visitors to the whaling station to photograph
themselves and their children beside dead whales, they were now
taking them to photograph themselves with living whales. Ideas
which are ahead of their time will always be laughed at. But I'm
proud that the last laugh was on the nay-sayers, and that the
Icelandic whale watching industry turned out to be a benefit to
Icelanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Beyond whaling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have returned to Iceland several times in the course of these
twenty five years, mostly in connection with work I was doing with
Greenpeace to improve international environmental policy and law to
prevent marine pollution. That's an issue which Iceland is aware of
and active on, as you would expect an island country entirely
surrounded by ocean and heavily dependent on fish exports to
be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Crewmembers of the 1978 Greenpeace voyage to Iceland" title="Crewmembers of the 1978 Greenpeace voyage to Iceland" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53311"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Since
the early 1990s, whenever I had the time to pass by the harbour
during a Reykjavik visit, I would always go and see the four
decommissioned whale catchers of Hvalur hf. The sight of these four
superb steamers brings back a lot of memories each time of course,
but also the thought that they would be perfect whale-watching
boats, for logistical as well as symbolic reasons. Although the
four catchers have been inactive for many years, the whaling
company Hvalur hf keeps them well fitted and maintained as if they
were ready to go whale hunting at any minute. I remember asking
Arni Finnsson, a veteran Icelandic conservationist, why that
was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could they be expecting the hunting season to be re-authorised?
"Well, no," said Arni, "they are just making a statement in this
way". If this is the best way for the whaling company to save face,
so be it, but these guys always remained pretty active for a
company that had not harpooned a single whale for many years, and I
bet they are watching closely what is happening up north with the
limited resumption of Minke whaling that the government has just
authorised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, although I would tend to agree that the catch of
a few Minke whales is not the most pressing environmental
challenge, I think Greenpeace has been right to react to it this
summer, because it is a test case, for whalers and conservationists
alike. I remember that during my last visit to Iceland, in the
spring of 1998 to participate in a technical meeting of the OSPAR
Commission, the intergovernmental body that regulates marine
pollution in the North East Atlantic, the Board of Directors of
Hvalur hf was meeting - purely by coincidence - in the same hotel
and on the same floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even bumped in to Mr. Kristian Loftson, the Head of Hvalur hf,
along with some of his associates, in the elevator. It was clear
from their body language that these guys were not getting together
to talk about the weather or share photos of their
grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any opportunity, they'll be out there again harpooning large
Fin and Sei whales. I'm certain they'd even harpoon blue whales if
they were allowed, and it's precisely that kind of pressure on the
Icelandic government which makes any return to whaling dangerous.
The history of the industry is one in which more and more whales
are hunted until the target species is depleted, and if the whalers
can get over the initial public opposition to their Minke hunt, it
won't be long before higher quotas and additional species begin to
creep in to the industry's demands to the government. This is one
industry whose record of self-management is provenly appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the years that I've worked with Iceland in the
diplomatic hallways and side rooms of international treaty
negotiations, I came to appreciate what a minority Mr. Loftson and
his kind are in Icelandic politics, and how their single-minded
approach to resource exploitation is fundamentally at odds with the
principles which inform Iceland's environmental policies
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many Icelanders would believe that their nation and
Greenpeace worked side by side for many years, quietly behind
closed doors, far away from the television cameras and journalistic
buzz that accompanied our confrontations on the high seas. But it's
a fact, and a story which is overdue in telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Read the conclusion next week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;This is Part II of a three-part

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year the planet awes us with meteorological phenomena, like monsoons in Asia and hurricanes off the Americas. But however devastating these have been, there was at least some form of continuity and predictability in their seasonal appearances. Now it seems that predictability is a thing of the past, with cases of extreme weather on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Japan suffered from its third typhoon in three weeks. It is the fourth major storm to hit Japan since late August, and is reportedly the most powerful to hit Okinawa since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor harvests, caused by this summer's bad weather and flash floods, are having serious consequences for farmers in northern Europe. Entire fields have been left to rot due to the summer's heavy rainfall. Some countries have had their wettest summer months on record. In 2003, dry weather provided a bumper harvest, but the havoc caused by this year's torrential storms could also reach into 2005, thanks to seed and soil damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more scientists are indicating that climate change is to blame for these recent erratic weather patterns. The concentration of CO2 (the main greenhouse gas) in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34 percent above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report examing the impacts of Europe's changing climate. The report suggests that between 1975 and 2001, the annual number of flood events increased and that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years will see Europe experiencing more frequent and economically costly storms, floods, droughts and other extreme weather. While there will be wetter conditions in northern Europe, the south will have drier weather, threatening agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heat waves, pose a lethal threat to the elderly and frail, as occurred in the summer of 2003. Melting European glaciers are also an issue with EEA report estimating that three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps are likely to disappear by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hotting up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 ºC per decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, serious flooding in 11 countries killed around 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least US$15 billion. In the summer 2003 heat wave, western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30 percent. Melting reduced the mass of Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. Who knows what the economic and social costs of summer 2004 will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hurricanes too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's hurricane season has dramatically shown the danger of a world with increasingly extreme weather. Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances and now Ivan have made landfall in the Caribbean and Florida. In March, a hurricane hit the Brazilian coast - the first ever recorded in the South Atlantic. These storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and killed scores of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming larger and more damaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of global warming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans started heating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by while hurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet - gather strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that the Earth is getting hotter-and fast. The real question is will we slow the meltdown by curbing our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Stay away from ExxonMobil/Esso!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;ExxonMobil/Esso is the most active company in trying to kill any action on climate change. Exxon has secured court injunctions in several countries to keep us away from Exxon property. We're actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso properties! To make sure we're all clear about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away&lt;/a&gt;. Tell them you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are two more things you can do now:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The recent Rainbow Warrior tour of Iceland was not the first time Greenpeace has tangled, or indeed occasionally tangoed, with Iceland on environmental issues. Rémi Parmentier was onboard the maiden voyage of the original Rainbow Warrior on our first visit to Iceland 25 years ago. In the first of a three part feature Rémi recounts what it was like to be on that first voyage and how it lead to the ban on commercial whaling.

            Rémi Parmentier
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was very strange for me to read in the newspaper, three or
four weeks ago, that Greenpeace was going to send the Rainbow
Warrior to Iceland because that country was about to resume
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;A Different World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty five years ago, in 1978, I was a crew member on the
original Rainbow Warrior's first voyage to Iceland to confront the
whalers. Twenty five years is a very long time, the span of a
generation. And in those twenty five years, everything has
changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· The world has shrunk through what we now call
globalisation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· The environmental crisis has exploded in ways that were hard
to envisage in 1978, even for the sort of environmental
missionaries we were at the time;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Activist NGOs have bloomed all over the world to address all
sorts of societal issues which conventional politicians appear to
be unable or unwilling to tackle - using the sort of approaches and
tactics that we were pioneering at the time;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Nowadays, information - including images and films - circulate
worldwide in real time from a Greenpeace ship in the high seas,
whereas in 1978, even fax machines did not exist. We relied on a
World War II-style short wave radio, and boxes of still photos and
16 mm film footage had to be sent for processing to a lab in London
or Paris before we knew (often several weeks after the action) if
there was anything worth showing in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything has changed. Yet, strangely, Greenpeace and Iceland
continue to argue over commercial whaling! How come? How did they -
how did we -- get stuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Foolish Trip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Chasing a whaling ship." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52279"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
first voyage of the Rainbow Warrior was a defining moment for
thousands - probably millions - of people throughout Europe and the
world; it was not the first Greenpeace anti-whaling expedition
(Greenpeace in Canada had initiated the first one with a chartered
fishing boat in 1975) but the Rainbow Warrior voyage was a moment
that triggered unprecedented public pressure on the International
Whaling Commission to declare a moratorium on commercial whaling
(which it would do relatively quickly, in 1982 - just four years
after that first voyage of the Rainbow Warrior).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace critics say that Greenpeace picks "soft and sexy"
issues that are "easy to sell" to the public, and the Greenpeace
campaign against whaling is often used as a prime example. But,
whereas it is true that in 1978 whaling was already a popular issue
in the Western United States (because Californians had "adopted"
the gray whales that migrate along their coast very close to the
shore from Mexico to Alaska every year) and Western Canada (whose
island waters were also populated by whales), in Europe and the
rest of the world it was - at best - a very, very, marginal issue.
The truth is not so much Greenpeace picking "sexy" issues, as our
critics say, but that - once Greenpeace had picked up an issue -
sufficient attention was drawn to it in a creative way to change
the public's perception of it, and to make it popular. In 1978
whaling was only an emerging issue in most of the world, and it was
at the time a real challenge to turn it into a mainstream one.
Pretty much like, today, the issue of shark finning which a number
of environmentalists are rightly trying to highlight as an
environmental and animal rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Winning the War, Losing the Battle of Iceland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the first Rainbow Warrior campaign led public opinion in
most countries to demand a cessation of whaling, for the Icelanders
the emergence of Greenpeace's whale campaign meant the opposite.
Still today, Iceland is a very small and tight community; and of
course it was even more so in 1978. The entire country had no more
than 220,000 inhabitants, and very few visitors from abroad. In
addition, only a few months after a cod war which saw opposing
Icelandic and British vessels (and their coast guards) fighting
over fish stocks, the arrival of the British flagged Rainbow
Warrior - however peaceful and transnational in essence - was
perceived by many Icelanders as an offence and an aggression
against the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="whaling station at Hvalfjordur" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52282"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
addition, the whaling station at Hvalfjordur ("the fjord of the
whales" in Icelandic), north of Reykjavik was one of the few
accessible tourist attractions, and a good place for Reykjavik
students to get a summer job. So, many people of all ages who were
leading figures in the country (i.e. anyone having gone to
university, that is all lawyers, members of Parliament,
businessmen, journalists, etc) had either worked at some stage of
their lives in the whaling station, or had had close friends and
relatives who had. And of course, with the export of whale meat to
Japan, the whaling company, Hvalur hf, was a good business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern was also probably occurring in the west and
north of Iceland, where the hunt of the smaller minke whales was
taking place - the very same that the Icelandic government has now
put up for grabs. But in 1978, and in 1979, we never went after
those smaller boats. Our target was the fleet of four large whale
catchers operating out of Hvalfjordur, killing several hundreds of
large Fin, Sei and Sperm whales (mostly for export to Japan) in the
large area of water that separates Iceland from Greenland. There
were several reasons for going after these large boats: the Minke
whale catchers were quite small compared to Hvalur's and we wanted
to look like David, not Goliath; also the Hvalur boats were hunting
large whale species that were (rightly) thought to be more
endangered; and they belonged to a corporation doing business with
Japan, and very influential within Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace campaign in Iceland started at a time when we
were obviously still at the beginning of the learning curve. We did
very little before-hand to explain to the Icelanders who we were
and what we were up to. It was only at the very last minute that
Allan Thornton (who was running Greenpeace in the UK at the time)
and I went to Reykjavik to announce that we would be there with the
Rainbow Warrior less than a month later. Even if we had thought of
being more educational, we probably could not have done it because
we were broke and the entire operation was run on a shoe string.
What we got, at least initially, was a defensive reaction and some
hearty laughter. Most of these sea-savvy people knew how fast the
whale catchers could go, and how skilled were their crew. The truth
is that Allan and I looked like dedicated environmentalists, but
not like crafty old sea dogs. If it was going to be a chase, the
Icelanders knew where to place their bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was something more to it, which shows that - despite
our innocence - we weren't totally unsophisticated. There was a
logic in the overall geopolitics of commercial whaling for going
directly after Iceland, and not - say -- after Japan and the Soviet
Union. Of course these other two countries were by far catching
many more whales with their fleets of factory-ships and catchers in
the Antarctic and the North Pacific, but the countries with
medium-scale coastal whaling like Iceland were - with their votes -
preventing the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from agreeing
a moratorium on commercial whaling which required a three-quarter
majority vote in favour. The idea was to split the whalers; by
putting pressure on countries with fewer vested interests than
Japan and the Soviet Union, we thought perhaps we could get at
least a moratorium on pelagic whaling (whaling on the high seas,
with factory ships, by far the largest share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Crew of Rainbow Warrior on their way to Iceland in 1978." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="53209"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;It
certainly sounded like a wild idea at the time, and it was hard to
get any Whaling Commission delegates to sit down with us at all,
much less take this proposal seriously. It didn't help matters that
the most presentable of us looked like second-year Berkeley
University students, and the worst of us looked like dope-smoking
hippies stuffed into ill-fitting suits. However, a year later, in
July 1979, something amazing happened. The delegate from Panama
(who happened to be a whale-loving individual taking an activist
approach to his job), in a surprise move, proposed in plenary that
the International Whaling Commission vote on the moratorium in two
sequences: first pelagic/factory ship whaling that was only
practiced by Japan and the Soviet Union, and second coastal whaling
practiced by a myriad of countries including Iceland. There was a
real political earthquake. The whaling block cracked for the first
time. There followed a long series of hectic closed-door meetings
with the Japanese representatives shouting and arm twisting. But in
the end, the coastal whaling countries voted against Japan and the
USSR. They hoped that the public fury over commercial whaling would
dry up and go away once the moratorium pushed the issue off the
public agenda. But they also hoped that the inability of Japan and
the USSR to catch large whales in Antarctica and the North Pacific
would send the value of their own whale meat sky-high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Minke whale being cut up." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52273"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
just a few hours that day, the high seas were declared off-limits
to factory whaling ships - except for the smaller Minke whales; the
International Whaling Commission had experienced the largest single
catch-quota reduction of its entire history. It wasn't all
Greenpeace's doing of course, but there is no question we had
created a wave that helped set the right political mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought the fight to save the whales was practically over. We
couldn't have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza reached the Tongass in August on its "Endangered
Forests, Endangered Freedoms" tour, investigating the threat posed
by the Bush administration's large-scale logging strategies to
forests across America. The tour has already met with resistance
from local authorities who have thrown many obstacles in its way,
including denying dock space for the ship to make the visit as
difficult as possible. However, many local community members
(including the indigenous Tlingit peoples) have thwarted those
efforts, going so far as to offer us their personal berth
spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Much of the community welcomes us and wants Greenpeace to stop
the destruction of this unique and beautiful forest," said Mel
Duchin, Greenpeace campaigner onboard the MV Esperanza. "The US may
try to silence the message but the American public will hear the
truth about its government's role in forest destruction loud and
clear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Why Tongass needs protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNF is a remote coastal rainforest unparalleled anywhere on the
planet, home to awe-inspiring landscapes and robust populations of
grizzly bears, bald eagles, wild salmon, and other wildlife.
Stretching 500 miles along the Southeast Alaska coast, the 17
million-acre wilderness area is the largest intact temperate
rainforest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Bald Eagle, Tongass National Forest" title="Bald Eagle, Tongass National Forest" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53110"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 1,000 mist-shrouded islands, narrow inlets, and
glacier-carved fjords punctuate its 11,000 miles of coastline.
Enormous Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and red and yellow cedar
dominate its ancient forests. These trees often grow to over 200
feet and live for more than 1,000 years. Set against a majestic
backdrop of coastal mountains towering up to 18,000 feet, the
rainforest of the Tongass is also home to diverse communities which
depend on the forest's resources for survival. Commercial fishing
and tourism are mainstays of the local economy, and the bounty of
the land and sea continues to feed rural families, many of whom
still lead a traditional subsistence way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island system and high mountains of the Tongass support a
wide variety of native wildlife. Much of the terrain is arduous and
difficult to penetrate. As a result many species have been isolated
for generations, creating wide genetic diversity and resulting in
an ecosystem even more rare and threatened than tropical
rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest density of grizzly bears in North America thrives in
the vast wild reaches of the Tongass. It's also home to the unique
blue bear and the rare Alexander Archipelago wolf, together with
thriving communities of other rarely seen animals such as
wolverines and black-tail deer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Bear face" title="Bear face" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53101"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead fly magnificent birds such as the bald eagle and
northern goshawk. Ancient runs of all five species of wild Pacific
salmon return here each year, nurturing the forest and its
wildlife. Killer whales, humpback whales, porpoises, river and sea
otters all thrive in the forest's nutrient rich waters. The
surrounding ocean has healthy populations of Steller sea lions and
Marbled Murrelets, both listed as federally threatened, and its
old-growth forests are home to the Queen Charlotte goshawk, also
under consideration for federal Endangered Species protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;A Brief History of Forest Crime - Tongass Style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the Tongass is most heavily logged of America's
national forests. Dense patchworks of roads and thousands of
clearcuts (created when an entire area of forest is felled, often
just to get at a few high value trees) have replaced its most
productive fish and wildlife habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1950, approximately one million acres of Southeast Alaska
have been clearcut. Over 70 percent of the biggest and best forest
has been logged, resulting in the loss of much of the most critical
wildlife habitat. Two pulp companies enjoyed exclusive, long-term
contracts to log the ancient forests of the Tongass, exporting
mainly to Japan. By the time large-scale logging peaked in the
1980s,annual cuts were as high as 480 MMBF (Million Board Feet) and
over 4,650 miles of roads had been built, primarily for logging
access. Due to a long-term decline in world pulp prices and
increasing public outcry, the two mills closed in the mid 1990s and
production fell dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Esperanza in harbour, Alaska" title="Esperanza in harbour, Alaska" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53113"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now plans are afoot to re-introduce industrial-scale
commercial logging. President Bush signalled his intentions in 2001
by giving former forestry industry lobbyist Mark E. Rey control
over the US Forest Service. Talk about putting the fox in charge of
the henhouse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backed by a White House that is hostile to wilderness protection
and an extremely pro-development Alaskan state legislature, the
Forest Service announced its intention to conduct 50 large-scale
timber sales in pristine areas of the Tongass in early 2003. The
targeted trees are mainly red and yellow cedar - which are in
long-term decline and regenerate very slowly - and the largest
old-growth spruce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-five percent will be clearcut, and its sale disguised
behind fire prevention and post-fire salvage operations, pseudo
"forest health initiatives" and "restoration" programs. The Bush
administration and the Forest Service have manipulated the public's
fear of fire to undermine environmental laws and public process in
pushing their commercial logging and thinning agenda - these very
same activities are what have created younger, denser and more
fire-prone forests. The Forest Service is working hard to increase
the annual cut back up to over 200 MMBF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Whale flukes, Tongass National Forest" title="Whale flukes, Tongass National Forest" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53107"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, these timber sales should all be prohibited under the
"Roadless Rule." Enacted by former President Clinton shortly before
leaving office, the rule bans logging and road building on 58.5
million acres of national forest land, and commands strong public
support. Just over half the Tongass National Forest (9.2 million
acres) is roadless area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction of the rule resulted in record low levels of
logging in the past two years. But the Bush administration has
indicated that it plans to undercut or eliminate the Roadless Rule
and has already proposed exempting the Tongass from the rule. The
logging and road building that the administration is pushing for in
these forests would destroy wildlife habitat, silt up world-class
salmon streams, and degrade forever the pristine character of
America's last great temperate rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Bush administration succeeds in derailing the Roadless
Rule, the Forest Service could sell a staggering 800 million board
feet (MMBF) of old-growth trees in the next three years. Their own
Tongass 10-year Timber Schedule calls for logging just under a
billion board feet from roadless areas by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Who benefits?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Forest mists" title="Forest mists" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53104"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wildness and remoteness of the Tongass makes it an expensive
place to log. In fact, the federal government loses taxpayer's
money on every tree it sells. The Tongass has been the biggest
money-losing national forest for the past 40 years, losing over $30
million annually on commercial timber sales. Consequently, the
Forest Service repeatedly says it has insufficient funding to pay
for recreation and tourism planning, or to do as much thinning as
it would like. Without massive tax subsidies, most logging
operations would have never taken place. The Bush administration's
moves to revitalize logging of the Tongass will only increase
taxpayer losses on government welfare to timber companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeated studies have shown that healthy forests provide far
greater economic benefits than do logged ones. Healthy ecosystem
qualities such as clean air and water, fish, wildlife and
recreation, generate far more jobs and economic benefits for
Tongass communities than timber dollars ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

	Each year for the last few years, the winds of March or April bring the desert to  Beijing.  No ordinary storms, these sun-darkening blasts shift and deposit millions of tonnes of sand across the city, into Tianjin and onwards, over the water to the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The dust storms, known in China as 'Yellow Dragons', have been increasing in frequency over the last decades.

            Camel owner Baoyin Culu says prayers at the place  where his last camel died. All of his 80 camels died due to desertification in the region.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desert's expansionist agenda has become a massive regional
problem -- so much so that the authorities in China, the Central
Asian republics, Mongolia, South Korea and Japan have jointly
committed resources and effort to stemming the tide of sands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of desertification began to receive the global
recognition it warrants at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. As a
result, the &lt;a href="http://www.unccd.int/"&gt;United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)&lt;/a&gt; was adopted in
1994. This week sees the largest gathering ever of high-level
officials and experts on desertification in Havana, Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Image of Mongolian sandstorm." title="Sandstorms originating from the Chinese and Mongolian deserts can reach as far as Japan. Each year, volunteers from Japan come to plant trees in Western China." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52762"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Over
a quarter of China's huge landmass is officially classified as
desert. Up to 400 million people are under threat from the
fast-advancing deserts in the country's western and north-western
provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi.
The impacts of desertification on urbanised eastern China are
severe and getting worse. Huge quantities of sand are deposited on
urban streets and the desert's leading edge is within 150 miles of
Beijing. Economic loss has been estimated at around US$ 6.5 billion
per year. However, the most severe impacts are felt by those who
depend on the lands being desertified - every day they see the
topsoil they rely on for food and for their livestock blown away on
the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desertification is caused by a complex combination of factors.
In China's Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang provinces in particular,
some of the causes are clear. The huge pressures on China to feed
1.3 billion people has resulted in a doubling of grazing livestock
numbers over the past 30 years. In 2002 China had 427 million head
of livestock, up from just over 200 million in the early 70's.
Previously arable land has also been over ploughed, loosening the
topsoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major contributing factor is climate change. And while
the problem is fueled principally by the consumption and driving
habits of the West, Beijing is rapidly becoming a car city itself.
In August of this year, the number of registered automobiles in
Beijing surpassed 2 million. Streets that were once thronged with
bicycles are now choked with cars. It took nearly 50 years for
Beijing to move from just under 2,000 registered vehicles in 1950
to 1 million in 1998. The second million vehicle was added in only
five years. As China and other nations reach for the same standard
of living that the West has championed for decades, using the same
destructive technologies and adding to the global emissions burden
that the US in particular refuses to reduce, the impacts on our
planet's fragile environment grow more severe with time's
passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warmer winters and less rainfall have left the fertile topsoil
of Inner Mongolia even more susceptible to the strong winds that
course across the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Image of goat in a coat" title="Goats in vegetation-starved areas must wear protective clothing to keep other desperately hungry goats from eating their hair." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52789"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
impacts on provinces like Inner Mongolia are harrowing. Livestock
are dying in large numbers due to lack of grazing ground, people
struggle for water as groundwater levels reach all-time lows, goats
eat each other's coats in a desperate search for nutrition, and the
threat of mass migration of people grows with each season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese authorities have made the battle against
desertification a top priority and are investing huge resources in
putting it in check. There is a massive reforestation programme, a
plan to lay down a "Green wall" of trees and plants stretching from
Beijing to Inner Mongolia, and farmers are being urged to cut back
on livestock numbers. Each year, Japan sends volunteers to plant
trees in a bid to end the deserts's creep toward Beijing and the
lengthening reach of the dust-laden winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Image of boy from Inner Mongolia drinking unclean water" title="Boy drinking unclean water. Scarcity of water has lead to unclean water being sold to local people. With the increasing drought and the rise in desertification in the area fresh drinking water has become a precious commodity." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52771"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;All
the effort to stop the desert, however, is merely addressing a
symptom, not the cause. The problem of climate change doesn't
respect borders. Low-efficiency cars rolling off assembly lines in
Detroit are as much a part of the problem of desertification as the
lack of vegetation in Inner Mongolia. Unless the world takes joint
action to curb carbon dioxide emissions and adopt the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change, desertification, sea-level rise,
floods, droughts and other impacts will continue to be consequences
of human impact on the climate. Worldwide action is needed now. And
if China, with its massive renewable energy resources, can curb its
greenhouse gas emissions by harvesting renewable sources, that may
help slay the Yellow Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the poor of Inner Mongolia living close to a land turning to
dust, desertification is costing lives and livelihoods. For these
people, climate change isn't a chimera on the distant horizon: it's
a killer at large today.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Busted!  New Zealand trawlers caught in the act</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bottom-trawlers-caught-red-ha/</url><text>
	Looks like somebody was throwing us a red herring. Last week, Greenpeace activists targeted the Nelson, New Zealand headquarters of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC) in a peaceful protest against destructive bottom trawling. Their Chief Executive denied operating in international waters.  But guess what our ship, Rainbow Warrior, just found?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/the-catch-is-hauled-aboard-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The catch is hauled aboard the NZ deep sea trawler Corsair in international waters in the Tasman sea.  The red fish is orange roughy, the rest is mostly bycatch to be discarded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-presents-6000-stron/"&gt; &lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior located the Amaltal Voyager, Westbay, and Corsair around 350 miles off the coast of New Zealand on the Northwest Challenger Plateau. The plot thickens: it turns out that the Amaltal Fishing Company is a shareholder of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;previous bravado&lt;/a&gt;, the bottom trawling industry doesn't seem to want to communicate. The occupants of the three ships haven't responded to our contact via radio - except occasionally with, shall we say, "impolite" hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our intrepid Greenpeace activists documented the fishing activities on the high seas in the face of an unexpectedly large swell and a little subsequent seasickness, a different type of Greenpeace delegation began talks at the UN to secure a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. New Zealand will now be in the hot seat since all of the vessels revealed by the Rainbow Warrior were registered in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="61239"&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government has yet to say whether it will support or oppose a moratorium but they must be feeling the heat in New York at the moment," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, from aboard the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at a UN press conference delegates were treated to a rare broadcast from on board the Rainbow Warrior giving them a first hand look at the activists at work. Many scientists also made presentations at the conference - in fact over a thousand of them are supporting the call for a moratorium on bottom trawling because of the absolute devastation caused by this fishing technique. Many species have not even been described or discovered before they are fished out, while ancient corals and sponges are decimated, with little chance of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are only a small number of nations responsible for this environmental devastation," said Karen Sack, Greenpeace International Oceans Policy Advisor, at the UN. "While they reap rich rewards, the biodiversity of the least protected area of this planet is being wiped out. That is why the United Nations must impose an immediate moratorium on bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            McDonald's backs down on GE in New Zealand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our GE campaigner Steve Abel in New Zealand stated that:
"McDonald's has given us a position statement consistent with the
stance the company has taken in Europe which urges its chicken
suppliers to source non genetically engineered (GE) soya feed, and
we understand that is due to happen for the immediate future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inghams (which supplies McDonald's its poultry) has stated to
McDonald's that their next two shipments of soya meal into New
Zealand are to be sourced from a non-GE contaminated region of
Brazil. We will be keeping a close eye on these shipments and
seeking independent testing of the soy to demonstrate its non-GE
purity. And we will continue to campaign for an ongoing commitment
from Inghams to source non-GE feed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in New Zealand undertook a four-week public campaign
which targeted McDonald's stores throughout the country with
chicken-suited activists and a Ronald McDonald look-alike who
staged a mock resignation. The clown was later arrested for
blockading the 'golden arch' gates of McDonald's Wiri Distribution
Centre. The campaign urged McDonald's to take a position on GE
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the campaign has been humorous and good-natured, the
issue itself is a serious environmental one," says Abel. "GE crops
have led to an increase in herbicide use, lower yields, weed
problems and contamination of conventional and organic crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/ronaldarrest3.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;McDonald's has
already been proactive in sourcing non-GE derived ingredients for
their products over the last three years. "We commend McDonald's
for its efforts to date in ensuring the food ingredients it serves
are non-GE derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for McDonald's to request that its chicken supplier
seek a non-GE feed supply is more good news for both the
environment and for the public's GE-free food preference.
McDonald's has listened and responded positively to Greenpeace and
the public," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams however is not prepared to make a public statement and
will continue to import GE contaminated soya to Australia due to
claimed difficulties with the Brazilian port where the non- GE soya
is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25937/RonaldGE.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;"Inghams won't
commit to sourcing non-GE soya for the longer term but it has told
McDonald's that its next two shipments to New Zealand are non-GE,
which is a good start. However we will certainly keep up the
pressure for Inghams to commit to an ongoing and trans-Tasman
non-GE soya supply," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's largest poultry producer, Tegel, has been sourcing
a high standard Identity Preserved (IP) supply of non-GE soya from
the US since 2001. This comes at a premium of up to US$30 dollars
per tonne. Inghams is apparently not prepared to pay this premium
for the non-GE US supply so has sought less costly, non-GE
Brazilian soya.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a stunning setback to the Bush administration's attempt to shut down Greenpeace, a Federal Judge in Miami has dismissed the government's case against us for exposing illegal mahogany shipments.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Bush administration has a problem with dissent.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Adalberto Jordan cited insufficient evidence in dismissing
the case. Upon granting a jury trial last month, he expressed
doubts about the Justice Department's ability to prevail against
Greenpeace's claim that the criminal statute involved is unfairly
vague. "It is not a good sign," he wrote, "when the government
resorts to defining a phrase by repeating the phrase itself."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prosecution was widely criticized as an attempt to silence
Greenpeace. Al Gore called the case "highly disturbing" and Senator
Patrick Leahy warned that a successful prosecution would "have a
chilling effect on free speech and activism of all kinds."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time that an entire organisation faced
prosecution by the US government for free-speech related
activities. The case arose from an action in February 2002, when
Greenpeace volunteers carried out a peaceful protest against a
cargo ship which was transporting illegal mahogany from the
Brazilian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unable to find a law against protecting the environment, the US
government had to improvise. The best they could come up with was
an obscure 1872 law against "sailor mongering." The bizarre statute
was originally designed to discourage owners of inns and brothels
from boarding ships as they were about to enter port, in order to
lure the sailors into their establishments. It has only been used
twice in its 132-year history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA Executive Director John Passacantando stated "The
conduct for which the Ashcroft Justice Department seeks to
prosecute Greenpeace was, essentially, whistle-blowing -- publicly
exposing and preventing violations of U.S. law prohibiting the
importation of illegally harvested mahogany wood."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Miami Federal Courthouse, Passacantando said
that "America's tradition of free speech won a victory today, but
our liberties are still not safe; the Bush administration and its
allies seem bent on stifling our tradition of civil protest, a
tradition that has made our country stronger throughout our
history."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 100,000 people world-wide sent protest messages to George
Bush and US Attorney General John Ashcroft demanding that the case
be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Deni savor Amazon victory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/community-celebrates-amazon-de/</url><text>
	After more than 18 years of campaigning, it's time to dance.  The final line has been drawn protecting over 3.5 million hectares of Amazon rainforest, and now Brazilian indigenous people, called the Deni, celebrate the demarcation of their land.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace volunteer with Deni children. The Brazilian indigenous peoples, the Deni, celebrate the completion of the demarcation of their land after more than 18 years of campaigning.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who helped the Deni in fighting to protect their
territory--including activists from Greenpeace, the Missionary
Indigenous Council (CIMI), and Native Amazon Operation
(OPAN)--joined Brazilian authorities and journalists from around
the world in the victory party. Organized by the Deni's patarahu
(chiefs), the ceremony featured traditional songs and dance on the
banks of the Xeruã River, in the village of Boiador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deni demarcation will create an "ethno-environmental"
corridor of more than 3,600,000 hectares of Amazon rainforest,
linking eight indigenous lands. This corridor will ensure the
exclusive use of forest resources by more than 2,400 individuals,
including the Hi-mariman--an indigenous group numbering less than
200, who have had no contact with non-indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demarcating indigenous lands is an efficient method of
protecting the Amazon rainforest, which is under threat from
thousands of logging companies. The majority of these companies use
illegal and predatory tactics like fires, cattle ranching and
projects that ultimately open the heart of the Amazon to
destruction. Satellite images of the Brazilian Amazon revealed
increased deforestation. The Brazilian Government estimated that
between August 2001 and August 2002, the equivalent of five million
football fields were destroyed. This represented an increase of 40
percent in deforested areas in only one year, but it also revealed
that indigenous lands were currently spared from this
destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four years of working with the Deni to win the rights to
their land, we are convinced that the preservation of the Amazon
biodiversity, which is threatened by economic interests and an
unsustainable pattern of consumption, will only be guaranteed if it
is done in partnership with the people who take care of the Amazon
forest as their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;History of Deni Demarcation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, we have campaigned for the demarcation of the Deni
land, an area of 1,530,000 hectares located in the valley between
the Purus and Juruá rivers. At that time, we were investigating the
purchase of 313,000 hectares of forest by the Malaysian logging
giant WTK, who intended to explore the region to find timber to
produce plywood for exports. WTK has a poor track record of
disrespecting the law and indigenous people's rights. During field
investigations, we discovered that half of the lands purchased by
WTK--150,000 hectares--overlapped the Deni territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deni had begun their demarcation through official channels
in 1985, but the process proved extremely slow. Now aware of the
threat from WTK, they asked Greenpeace to assist in protecting
their traditional land. At first, they tried to accelerate the
official process of identification of the Deni boundaries in order
to have their land demarcated by 2001. This process failed after
becoming tied up in bureaucratic red tape, so the Deni chose to
self-demarcate their land with our help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We will never leave our land," said Kubuvi Deni, one of the
leaders. "We need this land to survive. We need to hunt and fish to
have food. To do that, we need a lot of space."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the determination of the Deni, we contacted CIMI and
OPAN--two Brazilian organizations with expertise in working with
indigenous people in the Amazon--and, together, they developed a
project to teach the Deni the necessary skills to recognize the
borders of their land and take charge of the demarcation process.
According to Ivar Busatto, from OPAN, "the fact that we were asked
to help out other groups and to enter into a fight to give the Deni
the recognition and rights they deserve, was extremely
important."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2001, the Deni began to self-demarcate their
territory. The process included opening visible trails in the
forest and placing signs to identify the indigenous land.
Greenpeace sent 13 volunteers to the region and a helicopter to
support the work. For over a month, the group worked under harsh
conditions in the forest, until the Brazilian Ministry of Justice
ordered the self-demarcation to stop and the non-governmental
organisations to leave the area. The Deni refused to stop, and
eventually after negotiation, their efforts were recognized. In
October 2001, the Minister of Justice at that time, Jose Gregori,
signed the Declaratory Act recognizing the rights and exclusive use
of these lands for the Deni. In May 2003, the official demarcation
finally started and the process has now been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deni fight for the demarcation of their land is an example
of determination of an indigenous people who took matters into
their own hands. It is a live testimony in defense of keeping the
Amazon resources in the hands of those who can better protect them:
the traditional populations who live in the forest. It is something
that deserves to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

            Harry Potter: working magic to save ancient forests
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian edition of Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix is printed on Ancient Forest Friendly paper (100% post
consumer recycled, processed chlorine free paper). That's not only
good news for Canada's ancient rainforests and the vast boreal
forests that stretch across the north of Canada, it's also good for
forests around the world and the species that depend on them for
their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By printing Harry Potter on Ancient Forest Friendly paper,
Raincoast Books is turning the page on ancient forest destruction
and working a little magic of their own for the world's ancient and
endangered forests. We look forward to seeing publishers in other
countries follow the lead of their Canadian colleagues." said
Nicole Rycroft, Campaigns Director of Markets Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter is the biggest publishing phenomenon of our time
and is distributed in more than 200 countries around the world. The
Canadian edition, published by Raincoast Books, is the only version
of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be printed on
ancient forest friendly paper internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets Initiative, a Canadian environmental organization, has
worked with Raincoast Books and other Canadian publishers to
eliminate the use of papers derived from ancient and endangered
forests during the past 2.5 years. Similar work is taking place
with book publishers in the US and 5 European countries.
Thirty-five leading Canadian and thirty US publishers have formal
commitments to phase out papers originating from ancient and
endangered forests and millions of ancient forest friendly books
have been printed in Canada during the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;How much forest is Harry saving?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By printing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on ancient
forest friendly paper, Raincoast Books is minimizing its impacts on
the environment and helping safeguard biodiversity and the world's
ancient and endangered forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using 1,121,049 kilograms of 100% post-consumer recycled,
processed chlorine free paper and fibre instead of virgin fibre
means that Raincoast Books is making the following ecological
savings :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29,640 trees (a forest area equivalent to 95 times the size of
a football stadium)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;47,007,044 litres of water (water to fill 31 Olympic sized
swimming pools)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;633,557 kgs of solid waste (equivalent to 155 average female
elephants)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;20,248 BTUs of electricity (195 years of electricity to power
the average North American home)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1,215,443 kilograms of greenhouse gases (3.9 million kilometers
traveled by car with average fuel efficiency)&lt;/li&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EU forest crime scene exposed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-forest-crime-scene/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit have descended on the swanky refurbished EU buildings in Brussels after undercover investigations revealed that wood used in their renovation originated from companies associated with the illegal and destructive Indonesian timber trade.  We decided to get out the power tools and do a little 'renovation' of our own. Now the buildings have a fresh forest-friendly look rather than sporting illegal timber straight from the homes of tigers and orang-utans.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Greenpeace activists build an FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) plywood blockade outside the EU social and general HQ, Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 50 activists, from across Europe, cordoned off the area
around the buildings with colourful 'forest crime scene' tape,
while climbers rappelled off the buildings and redecorated with a
banner saying 'EU: Stop Illegal Timber'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="59694"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists also boarded up the building with plywood
(environmentally sustainable this time) in an effort to halt
construction while the forest crime scene is further investigated,
and in true 'Changing Rooms' style spruced up meeting rooms by
removing suspect timber from the floorboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our self-made refurbishers then rather helpfully delivered a
load of environmentally friendly wood to the EU building to show
contractors what they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Indonesia's rainforests should be home to orang-utans and
tigers, not EU bureaucrats in plush offices and chambers," said
Gavin Edwards of Greenpeace International. "Not only does the EU
allow the import of illegal wood into Europe, it is fuelling the
trade in illegal and destructive timber through its own building
projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edwards added that if Greenpeace could source environmentally
friendly timber to board up the buildings, then surely the EU could
find some for their renovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59688"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 90 percent of the logging in Indonesia is estimated to be
illegal, which means that logging is happening in national parks
and protected areas, and conflicts with local communities are
widespread. Forest products in the EU Economic and Social Committee
(ECOSOC) building include wood from RSK, IKMM and Mujur, all of
whom trade timber from the last rainforests of Kalimantan and
Sumatra, and AFR, a company shown to obtain timber from a protected
tiger reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;"The Commission attaches great [importance] to the requirement to ensure that timber is provided from environmentally sustainable sources, and now has in place arrangements to ensure that this requirement is respected" - Neil Kinnock, Vice President of the EU Commission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of discussion, the EU adopted an action plan in 2003
to tackle the trade in illegal timber. However, rather than
prioritising new legislation to outlaw such imports, its approach
focuses primarily on pretty toothless voluntary agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            What do these have in common? A grave threat to civil liberties: a US lawsuit against Greenpeace calling us sailormongerers for protecting the Amazon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 33-year history of Greenpeace the most unexpected
people have come together to protect the environment and used non-
violent direct action to highlight environmental crimes and
injustice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this collection is perhaps one of the most extraordinary.
What they do in the coming weeks could have significant
implications not only for the future of Greenpeace in the US, but
also for civil disobedience and the right to freedom of speech for
all in America and even beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, on May 17th, Greenpeace USA will be under threat of
being declared a criminal organisation at the behest of the US
Attorney General, under an obscure law that has been invoked only
twice in its 130 years on the statute books - the last time was
more than 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual activists have been prosecuted in the past for
carrying out action in support of Greenpeace campaigns worldwide -
it is not unusual, and those individuals are prepared to take the
consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, six Greenpeace activists did just that. After two
of them boarded a commercial ship, the APL Jade, which was bringing
illegal mahogany into the port of Miami, Florida, they pleaded
guilty, were fined and sentenced to "time served" - the weekend
they all spent in jail. The judicial process had run its
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so we thought. 15 months later Greenpeace USA headquarters in
Washington was served notice that the US Attorney General's office
would be prosecuting the entire organisation for the action - the
first time in history that the US Government has prosecuted an
advocacy group for a free-speech related activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of a few weeks, US law could be used in an
unprecedented way to declare Greenpeace USA a criminal
organisation, as a result of acting to protect Brazilian mahogany -
a species now declared at risk according to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is worth
noting here that at the time of the CITES declaration, many
governments congratulated Greenpeace for the years of campaign work
to protect the species. Now one government is prosecuting us for
doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenpeace sits in the dock in Miami, the loggers,
shippers and traders of that illegal mahogany have cashed in and
laughed at the law. Illegally logged wood is still going to the US
and other countries around the world, the criminal underworld is
still operating in the heart of the Amazon, those trying to protect
the world's greatest rainforest are still operating under threat of
death and sometimes dying, and countries like the US are still
failing to live up to their promise under CITES to protect
mahogany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this case is not just about Greenpeace and the Amazon. On
trial is also the fundamental and cherished right to freedom of
speech and civil disobedience. Many leaders and other advocacy
groups in the US have recognised the great risk to civil liberties
this prosecution presents and are supporting Greenpeace. They
include former US Vice President Al Gore, the civil rights leader
Julian Bond and the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
Sierra Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, back to the original question. Who are all these
characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="bodystd" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/hilary.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Hilary Hosta" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Hilary Hosta is a young woman from California who spent a weekend in jail and was subsequently convicted with the other five Greenpeace supporters of taking action against the APL Jade - the  ship bringing the illegal logged mahogany into the Port of Miami, Florida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/rose.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Rose Young" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Rose Young is an Italian American who has worked for Greenpeace for most of her adult life after running away from home in her teenage years. Now a grandmother of five and mother of three, she has been at the heart of some of Greenpeace's most successful campaigns worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Jane Moscowitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Jane Moscowitz is one of the top criminal defense lawyers in Miami, Florida. Environmental prosecutions are not normally on her case book, but this is not a normal case...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/hamilton.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Hamilton Casara" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Hamilton Casara is a member of Brazil's Chamber of Deputies and former President of IBAMA, the environmental enforcement agency of Brazil. He has first hand knowledge of the value of Greenpeace's environmental work in Brazil and beyond: "We are grateful to Greenpeace for helping us preserve the forests, it is very important to defend democratic principles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/ashcroft.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Evil incarnate" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;John Ashcroft is the man at the top of the US Department of Justice, who believe Greenpeace USA should be declared criminal for alerting the authorities to a crime that was about to happen on US soil. He is ultimately responsible for risking all our rights to freedom of speech through this prosecution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;David Halperin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;David Halperin is a lawyer and former White House aide for Bill Clinton. Today he is representing Greenpeace USA in court to ensure that the real criminals are brought to before the courts, not an environmental organisation that is upholding the rights of freedom of speech and protest while working to protect the Amazon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/paulo.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Paulo Adario" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;Paulo Adario has worked for Greenpeace in the heart of the Amazon for many years. He has seen the consequences of the illegal and unsustainable trade in mahogany and other wood first hand, witnessed the use of violence and slavery that is endemic in the logging industry, known environmental activists who have been murdered as they tried to protect the greatest rainforest in the world and is himself under threat of death for his work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/cancan.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Evil incarnate" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;"Sailormongering" was the conduct that an 1872 US law was aimed at preventing, the practice of tavern and brothel owners  waylaying ships heading into port and enticing their crews ashore, stealing their money and rendering the ship unable to function. It has been used twice in 130 years. This is the law under which Greenpeace USA has been indicted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25943/amazon.gif" border="0" height="143" width="116" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="The Amazon" align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="bodystd"&gt;&lt;span class="bodystd"&gt;The Amazon rainforest is the lungs of the world. It has almost unimaginable biodiversity, is home to tens of millions of people and a vital component in the fight against global warming. And still it is being systematically stripped by money hungry, corrupt logging companies ready to use any means necessary. If we do not continue to act to protect it, it will be lost forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these folks will be in Miami in the lead up to and during
the trial, with the exception of John Ashcroft, the monkey, and the
19th century prostitute. Sadly, Ashcroft is not required to give
evidence about why the Bush Administration feels the need to outlaw
Greenpeace, nor will he be able to answer why the Bush
Administration feels the need to allow the real criminals to go
unpunished and the Amazon to continue to be plundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/bin/view.fpl/10048/action_id/195.html"&gt;
Tell Bush&lt;/a&gt; to prosecute illegal loggers, not peaceful
protestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Join Greenpeace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions even more when we're
under attack from the US government. In order to ensure that we
remain an independent voice for the planet, we don't accept
corporate or government funds: we rely on the small donations of
millions of supporters. Greenpeace exists because this fragile
earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It
needs action. Please &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/join"&gt;help by becoming a
supporter today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning 70 international Greenpeace activists uncovered thousands of tonnes of Genetically Engineered (GE) soya in warehouses in the Italian port of Ravenna. Recent samples taken from one of the warehouses have proven to be GE positive. Activists are currently preventing any GE soya from leaving the facility and are taking further samples.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            GE camaigners target warehouses in Ravenna, Italy
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This next stage of the European leg of our GE campaign has seen
activists cordoning off the area around the warehouses and
displaying banners declaring 'Europe says no to GMOs' and 'No to GE
Food'. Our aim is to make Ravenna a GE-Free zone and to end all GE
soya imports in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our Italian activists Paola Lipari describes how this
morning's events unrolled: "We wanted to find either soya beans or
soya meal to analyse to find out what was GE. We formed two teams.
The first went towards the warehouse of 'Docks Cereali' company and
the second toward 'Eurodocks'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We entered the facility around 5.45 am with no problems. A
security man asked us what we were doing there and we told him that
we were trying to find soya to take samples to analyse. We added
that we are not meant to interfere with their job. We found huge
mountains of soya meal stocked into the warehouse. Finally we found
soya beans and took samples from it carefully sealing them on
plastic bags. We reached the exit but most of it was taken by the
police, but still, some remained safe and we were able to carry it
outside. In the meanwhile the second sample team also got
samples."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Greenpeace climbers hang a banner reading " the="" align="left" to="" docks="" cereali="" border="0" vspace="4" silos.="=" gmo=" 4=" from="&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/inline_item&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;" ravenna is main entry point of ge contamination into italy said our italian campaigner federica ferrario. soya being grown feed vast profits a few large farmers and global agri-business companies such as bunge cargill dreyfus. these plus others control seeds trucks shipping processing this soya. they also import market could within one year supply non-ge for every all if so choose.&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our GE campaigners are yet again challenging these
multi-national companies, who are buying GE soya, to answer our
questions so that consumers in Europe and farmers in Latin America
can choose to go GE free. This is what we want to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they only import GE soya or, do they also import non-GE
soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they keep the non-GE separate from the GE soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Which food companies buy these GE soya imports and which food
products are they being used to produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Will they label the meat and dairy products from the animals
that eat this GE soya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Do they want our protest to continue or do they want to give a
commitment to make Ravenna GE Free, as a first step to making all
imports to Italy GE Free?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy currently imports 4.2 million tonnes of soya annually for
food and for animal feed. The port of Ravenna accounts for an
estimated 2 million tonnes of these imports and so is the main
entry point for GE contamination into Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management of the nearby Bunge/Cereol soya bean processing
facility has told us that they are currently GE-free because they
are importing non-GE soya from Brazil, however they added that they
may re-start GE imports as of October. Bunge/Cereol has two other
soya bean processing facilities in Italy in Ancona and Porta
Maghera which import GE soya meal from Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto, our GE campaigner from Argentina in Ravenna
commented: "GE soya covers over 14 million hectares in Argentina.
It is green but it is a desert. Now forest is being logged to clear
the land for GE soya production. For the future health and wealth
of Argentina the GM soya monoculture must be stopped."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's activities follow on from another important action
yesterday, in Chioggia, Italy. The Esperanza intercepted the
Panama-registered bulk carrier, 'Keoyang Majesty' carrying 40,000
thousands tonnes GE soya from Argentina and demanded an end to the
massive contamination of the Italian food supply from these GE
imports. Some of our activists are still on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activities in Latin America are also going well, over the
weekend we had a victory in Brazil. Another Argentinean ship
'Global Wind', which we had been tracking for a few weeks, left the
GE-free port of Paranagua. After 19 hours our action came to an end
as our activists prevented non GE soya being loaded onto the GE
contaminated ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>genetic engineering</value></taxonomy><date>2004-05-10 00:00:00</date></item>

	Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise have prevented the entrance of the 'Global Wind' ship into the port of Paranagua, Brazil. The ship is carrying 30 000 tons of Genetically Engineered (GE) soya from Argentina.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace activist chains himself to the anchor chain of bulk carrier 'Global Wind', a ship carrying GM Soya from Argentina planning to
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our activists left the Arctic Sunrise around 10 AM. Just 10
minutes were enough for them to reach the Global Wind. Pablo, an
activist from Argentina, chained himself to the anchor and labelled
it with a GE banner, his presence also prevented the ship going
into the port with its contaminated shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraná, the second biggest soya producer in Brazil banned the
growing, transport and export of GE soya in its territory last year
after the federal government gave temporary approval for GE soya.
Paranagua is the only port in Brazil that implements strong
measures to keep its export free of GE contamination despite the
fact that it is under huge pressure to accept GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global Wind is comming from Argentina half loaded with GE soya.
Its aim is to complete its cargo with non-GE soya at the Port of
Paranagua. Obviously, we couldn't let so much effort to produce
non-GE soya be in vain if this cargo would be mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="A Greenpeace chains himself to the anchor of the Global Wind to protest against GE soya." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59379"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
economical advantage of being one of the only major world suppliers
of non-GE soya could be lost if there is no control to avoid
contamination," said Gabriela Vuolo, our campaigner on board of the
Arctic Sunrise. "Greenpeace demands assurances from the government
that it is not allowing Brazilian non-GE soya exports to be
threatened."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Brazil's federal government allowed GE soya to enter
the country and it has not taken the necessary measures to
guarantee that the proper use of documentation and information to
track these crops is followed as the national and international
legislation require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The federal government must support the efforts of Paraná state
to remain non-GE, and should immediately implement thorough control
measure to prevent GE contamination," said Gabriela Vuolo. "It must
support Paraná's ban and extend the ban on GE soya to include GE
shipments coming to be "top-loaded" with non-GE. Other Brazilian
states should also to follow Paraná's example."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo stayed on the anchor until 2 PM, when Lata, a Brazilian
activist, went there to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

	The harpoons are ready, and the whaling season has begun. The Norwegian government plans to take 670 minke whales in the only openly-declared commercial whale hunt in the world, while the Japanese government aim to kill 210 minke, Bryde's, sei and sperm whales in the north-western Pacific in a so called "Scientific" whaling programme. Iceland, the world's third whaling nation, has not yet made a decision on this year's take or if their "scientific" research programme will continue.

            You can help prove to Iceland that whales are worth more alive than dead: promise a future trip there if the government stops whaling.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway, normally a country which prides itself on abiding by
international law, violates a worldwide moratorium on commercial
whaling with every whale it harpoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The real reason behind the hunt is the absurd and unscientific
claim that whales are eating too many fish and as a result harming
fisheries. Whales are a natural part of the ecosystem and &lt;span class="body"&gt;the real cause of declining fish catches is over fishing, not hungry whales,"&lt;/span&gt;
says our whale campaigner John Frizell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway falsely portrays the hunt as serving local needs. But the
Norwegian market is saturated with whale meat. Despite desperate
publicity efforts, freezers in Norwegian supermarkets are piled
high with unsold whale meat from the 2003 hunt. &lt;span class="body"&gt;Japan claims it only hunts whales for 'scientific' reasons.&lt;/span&gt;
Yet the body for which the "research" is being done, the
International Whaling Commission (IWC), does not need the data, and
has called for the programme to be ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the meat from caught whales, except sperm whale meat, which
is too toxic to eat, will be sold on the open market in Japan. The
&lt;span class="body"&gt;"researchers" sold 3,000 tonnes of whale meat last year for US$52 million.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning against whaling for thirty
years. We've put activists in front of harpoons, lobbyists at
conventions, and scientists out on the ocean. &lt;span class="body"&gt;Today we're asking supporters to &lt;a href="http://www.icelandwhalespledge.com/"&gt;pledge a future vacation to Iceland&lt;/a&gt; to save the whales&lt;/span&gt;:
starkly demonstrating that the value of whale watching and tourism
to Iceland far exceeds the commercial value of whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending whaling in Iceland would play an important role in
stopping the pro-whaling lobby group, led by the Japanese
government, and Greenpeace is concentrating effort on convincing
Iceland to declare independence from the whaling nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported by the Rainbow Warrior, we embarked on a public tour
in Iceland in September 2003 to present an offer to the Icelandic
Government which shows the clear economic and environmental gain in
&lt;a href="/international/Templates/Planet3/Pages/www.icelandwhalespledge.com"&gt;choosing tourism over
whaling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Visit Iceland, save whales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our supporters worldwide have been recruiting friends and family
to pledge to visit Iceland if the government stops whaling. So far,
more than &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=959&amp;amp;sk=is&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;37,000
people have signed up&lt;/a&gt;. This represents a tourism value of more
than US$40 million to Iceland, as compared to an annual whale hunt
value of just US$3-4 million. The fact is undeniable: &lt;span class="body"&gt;whales are worth more to Iceland alive than dead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ásbjörn Björgvinsson, chairman of the Icelandic Whale watching
Association, has sent a letter to Members of Parliament in the
North-Eastern constituency, stating his worries over the &lt;span class="body"&gt;ten-fold decrease in bookings of foreign tourists for whale watching trips this spring.&lt;/span&gt;
"It is not only the whale watching companies that lose money on
this, but all other tourist companies in the area, such as hotels,
restaurants, bus companies, various suppliers and airlines that
move these people to and around the country." Ásbjörn says that
their business partner in the UK, the travel agency Discover the
World, thinks that the main reason for this decline in bookings is
likely to be the whaling of Iceland. Ásbjörn says that his letter
encourages the politicians to react to this threat and end whaling
this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Iceland is just a tool used by the whaling lobby. Japan and
Norway persuaded Iceland to join them in whaling so they will be
less isolated. &lt;span class="body"&gt;If Iceland gives up whaling, it will defeat the move by the whalers&lt;/span&gt;
to expand the number of countries in an effort to make whaling more
respectable," said Greenpeace campaigner Frode Pleym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be campaigning at the annual IWC meeting in
Italy this July for the moratorium on whaling to be respected and
for the IWC to shift its focus away from catching whales to the
conservation of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Commercial whaling has always been a disaster for whales,
driving populations down to tiny remnants. &lt;span class="body"&gt;The only management scheme for whaling that shows any signs of success is the moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/span&gt;
and we want it maintained," concluded Frizell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break the whaling alliance of Japan, Norway, and Iceland by
convincing Iceland that the world believes whales are more valuable
alive than dead. &lt;a href="http://www.icelandwhalespledge.com/"&gt;Take
the pledge&lt;/a&gt; to visit Iceland's beautiful shores if the
government stops whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning our 'Gene Detectives' from the Esperanza intercepted and boarded the 'Winner' a ship carrying thousands of tons of GE soya where it is anchored just off Malaga in southern Spain.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists today occupy the cranes of the
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 8am this morning our climbers boarded the Winner - or as we
like to call it the Loser - from inflatable boats. Six volunteers
climbed onto the ship's cranes (to prevent them being used to
off-load any GE cargo) another two carried banners in English and
Spanish saying, 'Spain does not want GE Food' and 'We don't want GE
Food' one went on the mast and another on the anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Keenan, our GE Campaigner onboard the Esperanza said:
"GE soya does not feed the world as suggested by the misleading and
cynical marketing of GE companies like Monsanto. GE soya destroys
the environment where it is grown in Argentina and then millions of
tons of it are used to feed pigs, cows and chickens in Europe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Winner from Argentina is carrying about 9,000 tons of GE
soya and about 11,000 tons of maize for the company Nidera. The GE
status of the maize is not known at this time. However our 'Gene
Detectives' have demanded documentation from the captain of the
Winner to find out exactly what GE crops his ship is carrying. We
have also taken samples for independent analysis. 
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" winner="." alt="Greenpeace activists taking samples of maize from the hold of the " vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59184"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain is the second largest importer of soya into the EU,
importing 6 million tons annually from the USA, Argentina and
Brazil, of which over 4 million tons are estimated to be GE
contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In Argentina we have people going to bed hungry yet between
1997 and 2002 farmers in Argentina planted GE soya in over 14
million hectares of arable land, lured by the promises of higher
crop yields and cheaper seeds," said Daniela Montalto, our
campaigner from Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For a while the illusion worked, but now the truth is we are
facing an environmental and social nightmare in Argentina. We
invite people the world over to reject GMOs in favor of real,
sustainable agriculture which feeds people not pigs and we invite
people to also vote with their wallet - don't buy GE food."&lt;/p&gt;

	A fire recently broke out at a gas storage facility owned and managed by the largest oil company in the world, ExxonMobil. A thorough search of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, in conjunction with the Working Group on Community Right-to-Know, has failed to turn up a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Staten Island ExxonMobil fuel storage facility.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/2/fire-at-exxonmobil-s-staten-is.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/2/fire-at-exxonmobil-s-staten-is.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Fire at ExxonMobil's Staten Island storage facility.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Clean Air Act of 1999, facilities that use hazardous
substances are supposed to file RMPs with the US EPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is inconceivable that a facility in such a populous location
would not be required to file such a plan. The lack of an RMP in
this case raises several questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- If this facility did not file an RMP and it is supposed to,
what enforcement actions will the EPA take against the company?
What will the EPA do to make sure compliance is followed in the
future? How many other potentially hazardous facilities have failed
to file RMPs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- If this facility is not required to file an RMP, why not?
What is the threshold for facilities to file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have uncovered further information in regard to
environmental and safety violations at this facility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Benzene concentrations 20 times higher than permissible
levels contaminated discharged wastes found in two open-air ponds
at Port Mobil, which resulted in ExxonMobil paying a US$11.2
million fine in 2001. This is one of the largest fines levied
against a company in a hazardous waste case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- As recently as last September, the Department of
Environmental Conservation brought a complaint against this
facility for a host of safety and environmental violations,
including conducting the transfer of hazardous substances
improperly; failing to maintain equipment; and failing to equip
piping with leak detection equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our world's addiction to oil continues to cause human and
ecological tragedies such as this which can be, and MUST be,
avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is unsustainable because it produces carbon dioxide, the
primary cause of global warming. The only long-term solution to
local and global pollution caused by extraction, transportation,
production and use of oil is to phase it out. Instead the
international community must work to replace oil as an energy
source with renewable energy, which must also be combined with
energy efficiency and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, Greenpeace is pushing the Bush Administration to
support investment in renewable energies like wind and solar.
Unfortunately, it has been ExxonMobil that has been one of the
largest obstacles to a transition from fossil fuels to clean safe
energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

	Tourists got more than they bargained for this morning when they turned up at Spanish architect Gaudi's landmark cathedral, Sagrada Familia, in Barcelona. Greenpeace activists, clinging to the famous spires like orange-clad gargoyles, had added a splash of colour that even Gaudi hadn't imagined by hanging large banners saying "SOS" and "Save Our Seas" in a bid to catch the attention of the UN Environment meeting happening just down the road.

            Greenpeace climbers scale the top of the main towers of the cathedral La Sagrada Familia (The Sacred Family) and unfurl banners which read SAVE OUR SEAS.The action is timed for The Program of United Nations for the Environment in Barcelona, where discussion will take place for the future of the world's oceans.

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Latest Update: Greenpeace presents 6000 strong petition to UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25 activists from the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and
Belgium were out in force in Barcelona this morning. Some scaled
the menacing Sagrada Familia cathedral towers (despite a slightly
hair-raising wind) to hang banners and others wearing "SOS"
t-shirts handed out information on deep-sea bottom trawling to
tourists below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Politicans and officials are meeting down the road to discuss
our oceans for World Environment Day on June 5th, but we want real
action, not just more talk," said Kate Nustedt, Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want a real outcome. We want a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Environment Day has an Oceans theme this year, and next
week there is also an important UN Oceans meeting in New York. So
if you think you've noticed a bit of a pattern recently you're not
wrong - we are ramping up our Oceans campaign, and the net is
tightening around irresponsible fishing companies and governments.
Earlier in the week &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=485016"&gt;
the Rainbow Warrior left New Zealand on a deep sea mission&lt;/a&gt;,
activists in New Zealand had a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/news/news_main.asp?PRID=704"&gt;roughing-up
courtesy of the Orange Roughy Management Company&lt;/a&gt;, the Icelandic
government announced that it is &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=486962"&gt;
scaling down its "scientific" whaling&lt;/a&gt; due to "domestic
pressure" and today ... the launch of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;brand spanking new
Oceans site: Save Our Seas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;Save our
Seas&lt;/a&gt; features an interactive map and fascinating facts - get to
know the delightful snot eel which eats its dinner from the inside
out, find out why 100 million sharks are killed each year and why
tainted seafood costs US$7.2 billion a year. A key focus on the
site is also the fascinating and largely undiscovered deep sea
world which is currently under threat from bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveourseas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="/international/PageFiles/25935/map.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we will be presenting over 4700 names of
cyberactivists from around the globe to the UN Consultative Process
in New York which can help us secure a moratorium on the most
destructive fishing process in our ocean today - bottom
trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone recognises that our oceans are in crisis. We can't
continue to exploit them in this way, " said Carmen Gravatt,
Greenpeace oceans campaigner, speaking from the Rainbow Warrior.
'The deep seas are the last great unknown spaces on earth. We're
running out of time - we don't want another round of UN talking
shops. We want real commitments and real action to save our
seas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=1400&amp;amp;sk=std"&gt;Tell the
UN what you think of bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Many companies, when challenged by us, seek to silence questions through the court rather than provide answers. Production and use of the plastic, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is harmful to people and the environment in many ways. Two of Europe's biggest PVC producers sued Greenpeace in Italy for US$300 million rather face up to the problems of PVC. They lost.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When chemicals companies Solvay and EVC decided to sue us in
1997, they were following in a long corporate tradition of using
money and the courts to silence critics. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?ucidparam=20011110160436"&gt;
British Nuclear Fuels&lt;/a&gt; have been doing it for years, &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;Exxon(Esso)&lt;/a&gt; sets lawyers on
anyone daring to claim it is helping fry the planet and &lt;a href="/international/Templates/Planet3/Pages/&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;http:/www.greenpeace.org/news/details?campaign%5fid=3991&amp;amp;item%5fid=95486"&gt;
Dow Chemical&lt;/a&gt; seems to enjoy picking on penniless
protestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solvay and EVC were suing over our campaign to prevent poisonous
PVC plastic being used in children's toys. Many toy manufactures
removed PVC from their products and subsequently PVC was banned
from toys in most of Europe. However the industry was obviously
unwilling to accept that they had lost the argument. In Italy the
two companies sued us for damage to their image, reputation and for
illegal claims. They also maintained "production of PVC and PVC
products do not harm the environment".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the judge threw out all claims of the industry and
ordered the companies to pay the legal costs. Maybe next time the
companies might listen a little better to the voices of
environmental concern? We are not holding our breath though. We
will continue to make sure irresponsible corporations can not hide
their corporate crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists are over powered by a policeboat as they try to prevent the Dutch hired vessel NDS Progress from leaving her berth in Rotterdam harbour.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am on board the Rainbow Warrior in Rotterdam harbour, we are
currently along side a cargo ship loaded with US war supplies
headed for the Gulf. We have been here since seven this morning and
already many activists have been arrested, but the Rainbow Warrior
is holding its position and we are blocking the ship from leaving
port and heading for war. Despite huge European opposition in
public and political circles, military equipment is flowing freely
through the continent on its way to the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We traveled through the night, straight off an action in Antwerp
harbour where we tried to block a US military cargo ship from
loading with supplies for the war. When we arrived in Rotterdam
this morning the police had already surrounded the area. In fact,
as I was getting dressed in all my wooly clothes, I looked out the
port hole and could see a police van following us along the
shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are determined to do everything we can to stop this
relentless march to war. Not only would it make the world a more
volatile and dangerous place, it'd also be illegal, disastrous and
immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrived along side the cargo ship Progress that loaded war
supplies through the night to be ready for departure this morning,
the sun was just peaking over the horizon, a bright ball of red
flame to light our way and warm our activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was joined by three Greeenpeace inflatable
boats that can from further up the harbour, they immediately tried
to get activists in to position to climb up the stern of the
Progress, but the police inflatables were on top of them blocking
their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also launched two inflatable canoes into the water from the
Rainbow Warrior. What I can only describe as chaos ensued. Our
inflatables continued to try to get climbers onto the cargo ship
while the canoes distracted the police. Eventually one of the
climbers got close enough to the stern of the ship and began to
climb, only seconds passed before the police picked up the climber
and arrested him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch police and US military personel on the cargo ship and
key side turned high powered water cannon on the activists. Not
long after that the police picked up one of the canoes and arrested
the two Brits who were paddling. The other canoe returned to the
ship, there was a swift tidal current and it is bloody cold out
there with the wind. The police then began to round up our other
activists and inflatables in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police inflatable aggressively rammed one of our inflatable
boats, the police boarded it and two of the activists jumped into
the water. They were wearing survival suits that kept them dry and
warm and they were able to swim to shore where shortly we had
another inflatable pick them up and they are now safely back on
board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all this was going on a police boat crossed the bow of the
Rainbow Warrior, only a few metres away, the Captain radioed the
police that they had just made a very dangerous move crossing so
close in front of the bow. The police boat then came along the
starboard side and rammed the Rainbow Warrior several times. I was
on the bridge when people started shouting they are going to board,
the police are getting ready to board. The doors to the bridge were
locked, all hatches and portholes secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard the anchor chain start to go down, but we couldn't get
it all the way down before the police boat started pushing the
Rainbow Warrior out of the way. The police asked permission to come
a board and it was denied. They told us if we went within the
yellow buoys closer to the cargo ship, the Rainbow Warrior would be
seized and everyone arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we managed to get another three small inflatable boats
for the Rainbow Warrior in the water. They were all within the
yellow buoys and three inflatable police boats began to chase them,
but they have not been able to catch them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently holding our position and the police have not
yet come on board, but we expect them to come on board any
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have managed to block the cargo ship for four hours now, but
we can see more supplies for war arriving on the dock. Although
this is the first ship loaded with war supplies from the
Netherlands to the Gulf, it is not expected to be the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Bush and Prime Minister Blair have cited Iraq's
suspected possession of weapons of mass destruction as a
justification for an invasion, yet the US and the UK have some of
the world's biggest arsenals of such weapons. They have made it
clear they will not refrain from using their weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq and would even consider using nuclear weapons
although the International Court of Justice has ruled that
threatening nuclear war is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want the Dutch government to stop aligning itself with those
countries intent on war and to start listening to the views of its
people and to team up with other European countries that favour a
peaceful solution to the present crisis in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

	Marie-Thérèse Danielsson, who died earlier this week in Tahiti aged 79, was a key figure in the global campaign against French nuclear testing at Moruroa atoll.  With her husband, the Swedish anthropologist Bengt Danielsson, she brought to millions of people the injustice and dangers of the nuclear testing programme in their book "Moruroa Mon Amour."

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bengt and Marie-Thérèse Danielsson
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie-Thérèse was born in France, had lived in Sweden and
travelled widely, but her passion was for the people and
environment of Tahiti-Polynesia. She was a staunch friend and
supporter of Tahitian anti-nuclear and pro-independence activists
-- not an easy place to be in the heavily militarised, colonial
society of Tahiti in the 1960s. When the testing programme at
Moruroa ended in January 1996, she continued to campaign in Tahiti
and France for compensation and access to medical records for
Tahitian workers on the atoll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie-Thérèse first joined Bengt in Tahiti when he was doing
anthropological work in a remote atoll in Tahiti-Polynesia after he
had completed the famous Kon Tiki raft voyage from South America to
French Polynesia. That experience, working in a community
unaffected by much of 20th century western civilisation was rudely
interrupted by de Gaulle's decision to use Moruroa as a test site
in the early 1960s. The economy, society and culture of Tahiti
underwent a violent shock with a flood of 20,000 military
personnel. Bengt and Marie-Thérèse documented this "tsunami" as
they called it, which irrevocably changed Tahiti and its
people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie-Thérèse cared about people, first and foremost. She helped
create the space particularly for Tahitian women to speak out.
While Bengt lectured guests on the history of French colonialism in
Tahiti, she provided practical hospitality and friendship to an
international network of activists sharing her dream of a Nuclear
Free and Independent Pacific. Their home was always open to
visitors: the large library of books on Pacific cultures and
environment to pore over, fabulous meals, and a "visitor's bure" on
the edge of the lagoon at their house in Tahiti which was a haven
place for Greenpeace campaigners, Pacific activists, French
scientists and politicians and a whole host of globe-trotters. I
asked her once how she maintained her endless hospitality, her
capacity to give to others in spite of her own busy life of
activism and in latter years, Bengt's illness. She said simply,
"what goes around, comes around" -- that the goodness you give
eventually comes back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Marie-Thérèse on my first ever day in Tahiti. New to
Greenpeace and new to Tahiti, I was feeling jetlagged and slightly
disoriented after arriving on a 2am flight into Papeete. After I'd
visited a few contacts in the anti-nuclear movement in Papeete, I
went to make a phone call in the Post Office. A mysterious man with
a camera followed me, trying to snap my picture. I suspected the
authorities knew I was an activist, and were either trying to get a
picture for their files, or simply wanted to intimidate me. I rang
Marie-Thérèse and asked if this was normal. "Yes," she said, "don't
worry. Just come out and have lunch with us and use the phone
here." For years the Danielssons had had their phone bugged and
their mail opened by one of the various intelligence forces that
operated in Tahiti. In spite of this harassment and torrents of
abuse from the pro-French local tabloids, the Danielssons
documented the lies and inconsistencies of the French authorities
about the impact of the tests on people's health, the state of the
vulnerable coral atolls after the underground blasts, and the
cover-ups of accidents at the test site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie-Thérèse was also a founding member of the local Moruroa e
Tatou (Moruroa and Us) nuclear veterans association and of the
local section of the Women's International League for Freedom and
Peace (WILFP). Bengt and Marie-Thérèse were honoured in 1991 with
the Right Livelihood Award, the alternative Nobel Peace Prize. She
is to be buried in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace tank girls occupy war machine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tank-girls-occupy-war-machine/</url><text>
	Despite growing public opposition to a war with Iraq, day and night British tanks, helicopters and jeeps are streaming though Southampton as part of the build up of the war machine. For over a week we have tried to stop the supplies from loading and leaving the Uk and today 14 volunteers entered the military port occupying tanks and jeeps ready to roll on the ferry Stena Shipper bound for the Gulf.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Fourteen of Greenpeace volunteers entered Southampton's Marchwood Military Port and occupied tanks and jeeps queued up to be loaded on the roll-on/roll-off ferry Stena Shipper bound for the Gulf.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 08:00 am this morning, 14 of our volunteers entered
Southampton's Marchwood Military Port and occupied tanks and jeeps
queued up to be loaded on the roll-on/roll-off ferry Stena Shipper
bound for the Gulf. Four of our volunteers, all women, evaded
Ministry of Defence speedboats to reach the tanks via the quayside,
while ten others cut a hole in the perimeter fence and reached the
vehicles from the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some activists are chained to the exterior of the vehicles,
while others have climbed into tanks and secured the hatches behind
them. We've also started to paint the 'No War' message down the
sides of the military vehicles. Seven activists have already been
arrested, four are still locked inside the tanks and two others are
chained to them. Police are on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/26075/ashby.jpg" width="180" height="136" align="left" alt="American activist Ashby sends this image back from inside the British tank she is occupying in Southampton"&gt;
An American activist, Ashby 24, who climbed inside one of the tanks
and secured the hatch says "It's great to be able to do something
directly against the war, something I've been waiting to do since I
first heard about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Rainbow Warrior, Greenpeace campaigner Blake
Lee Harwood said, "We will use every peaceful means available to
try and stop an attack on Iraq. The government has already ordered
the cutting of our anchor chain and attempted to have the Rainbow
Warrior thrown out of Southampton but we will continue to find ways
to oppose this war which will have disastrous consequences. An
attack on Iraq would lead to massive civilian suffering and
increase the chances that weapons of mass destruction will be
used."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protests against the war with Iraq were also held in Australia
and France today. Greenpeace volunteers in Toulouse, France are in
the water trying to stop the impending departure of the Charles de
Gaulle aircraft carrier that's scheduled to go to Turkey for an
unknown purpose. The activists are asking President Chirac "If
you're not supporting the war on Iraq, why are you sending this
carrier to Turkey?" In Australia activists inflated a hot air
balloon outside Parliament House in Canberra with a message
demanding that the Australian government stop sending troops to
Iraq and to 'give peace a chance'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are opposed to war in Iraq, whether or not an attack is
sanctioned by the United Nations, because it would have devastating
human and environmental consequences. According to military and
health experts a conventional war could kill many thousands of
people mainly civilians and many more could die from famine and
disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush and Blair have cited Saddam Hussein's desire to acquire
weapons of mass destruction as justification for an invasion.
However, pre-emptive military strikes against states possessing or
suspected of possessing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons do
not provide a stable basis for controlling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe the solution to weapons of mass destruction is
collective international arms control and disarmament. The
framework already exists, in the form of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Biological Weapons Convention
and the Chemical Weapons Convention. But rather than being
strengthened, these global treaties are being undermined,
especially by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war is also clearly motivated by oil. The same forces that
are backing the war are also supporting the US's refusal to sign
the Kyoto Protocol, which would begin to combat climate change. The
same US companies that maintain America's oil addiction and oppose
the Kyoto Protocol are also backing the war against Iraq. The
British government has recently announced that one of the top five
priorities for foreign policy is securing access to energy
supplies. Yet Blair still denies that an attack on Iraq has
anything to do with oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What you can do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe that George Bush's war stance is based on
hypocritical arms policies and sticky oil connections, make your
voice heard.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UK war machine defies courts and seizes the Rainbow Warrior</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rainbow-warrior-seized/</url><text>
	For the last six days Greenpeace activists have peacefully protested in a UK port where military supply vessels are preparing for departure to Iraq. A High Court ruling has recognised Greenpeace's right to protest and denied the Defense department's request for an injunction banning the Rainbow Warrior from the area. But under the cover of darkness early Sunday morning Ministry of Defense officials defied the high court decision forcibly removing the Greenpeace ship from the Southhampton docks.

            Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior setting up peace blockade at Southampton's Marchwood military port stopping military hardware leaving for the Gulf.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was surrounded by six Ministry of Defense
and police boats and up to twenty police boarded the ship just
after 10:00 pm Saturday night. By 3:00 am they had cut the anchor
chain and towed the ship out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior had set up a peace
blockade at Southampton's Marchwood military port stopping military
hardware leaving for the Gulf. The Rainbow Warrior was anchored
directly in front of the military port where supply vessel 'Dart 8'
was loading with helicopters, tanks and jeeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peace blockade began Saturday following Defence Secretary
Geoff Hoon's failure to get a High Court injunction banning the
Rainbow Warrior from the area. The High Court Judge granted an
interim injunction stipulating that Greenpeace must not board or
touch the Ministry of Defense chartered vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace campaigner on the site, William Peden, says we have
acted completely peacefully during the course of this anti-war
protest and believes that the Secretary of State direction is
unlawful and an abuse of power. "We believe the government is
acting beyond its jurisdiction by going against the due process of
law. Not content to breach international law by pursuing an
illegitimate war in Iraq, they are now disregarding their own
domestic courts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every hour Blair is dragging the UK closer towards a war that
the British people don't want. Day and night tanks and helicopters
are streaming though Marchwood as part of the build up of the
military machine. We are determined to do everything we can to stop
this headlong rush into a war that will only make the world a more
volatile and dangerous place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A military attack on Iraq that could kill thousands of civilians
and increase the chances of weapons of mass destruction being used.
An attack on Iraq is clearly a barely disguised desire to take
control of Iraq's huge oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush and Blair have cited Saddam Hussein's desire to acquire
weapons of mass destruction as justification for an invasion.
However, pre-emptive military strikes against states possessing or
suspected of possessing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons do
not provide a stable basis for controlling them. It would require
repeated armed interventions against numerous countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe the solution to weapons of mass destruction is
collective international arms control and disarmament. The
framework already exists, in the form of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Biological Weapons Convention and
the Chemical Weapons Convention. But rather than being
strengthened, these global treaties are being undermined,
especially by the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;

sanctioned by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activist Tracy got a plankton's eye view of a US war machine as it entered Antwerp harbour to load up with supplies bound for the Gulf. The dock is lined with tanks, helicopters, jeeps and other military supplies and every day ships are coming, loading and heading straight for certain war. Join the millions saying no to war.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/1/ten-greenpeace-activists-climb.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ten Greenpeace activists climbed onto the harbour's lock gates and sealed it shut to prevent four ships loaded with US military equipment bound for the Gulf leaving the harbour and a US navy vessel entering it to be loaded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sun was just setting as we got into the boats. Five small
inflatables heading out for a rendez-vous with a massive military
ship. The Rainbow Warrior was following close behind. It was our
latest attempt to stop the build up to war, we wanted to prevent
four ships loaded with US military equipment bound for the Gulf
from leaving the harbour and a US navy vessel from entering it to
be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already 10 activists were at the locks that the ships must pass
through into the harbour to load. The activists climbed onto one of
the harbour's lock gates and sealed it shut. We approached from the
opposite side and attempted to block the entrance to the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrived the sun had set and a bright yellow full moon was
reaching into the sky. The police were already at the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/26071/painting.jpg" width="180" height="123" align="left"&gt;We maneuvered around the
entrance in our boats for a short period trying to find the right
spot and time to enter, and at last I heard those words that always
make my heart jump: "Go, go, go!" We raced towards the lock
entrance and one of the climbers attempted to climb up to the lock
bridge, but police were already waiting at the top of the wall.
Other activists set to painting "No War" on the walls of the
locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not there long when I heard someone say over the radio
that the US military ship was approaching the locks. At first we
could barely see it through the thick darkness and numerous small
lights that dotted the opposite side of the canal, but as it moved
closer it revealed itself to be a monster of a ship being moved
into place by two large tug boats. All that stood between the giant
military ship and the locks were five small Greenpeace inflatable
boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the entrance to the lock as the military ship was
slowly maneuvered into position. Our small boat got quite close to
the ship and it wasn't long before we had a large police boat in
our path and a helicopter buzzing above us with their spot light on
our boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly a different police boat, another inflatable, came to us
and said we better get out of the way, the military ship would not
stop for anything, and they quickly vacated the area. This is when
I began to worry. But the rest of the activists in my boat seemed
calm and confident, or perhaps it was just too dark to see if they
were worried as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tug boats moved the ship swiftly and expertly into the
locks, the unimaginably large hull of the ship sweep by us and all
five of our inflatable made it safely out of the way. But the stand
off was not over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the military ship was in the lock and had come to a
stop, we raced forward into the locks with them and zoomed in front
of the large steel doors that slide across to close the lock. We
were not going to let this military ship move on and load up for
war without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly the police were back on the scene and working hard to
get us out of the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take safety so seriously that it sometimes shocks us a bit
the way police behave in these situations. The large police boat
repeatedly rammed into the small inflatable boats. Once, as it came
close to our boat, a man with a hook on the end of a pole jabbed
the sharp end into our inflatable. Luckily no damage was done and
no one was injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the policed turned the water hoses on our boats to
try to move us out of the path of the lock doors. One of our
inflatables did not budge from the spot. But eventually the large
police boat and inflatable were able to push our inflatables out of
the lock and the gates began to close. We got out of the way. A
small Greenpeace inflatable is no match for a giant steel lock
door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped the military ship from loading tonight, but there
will be more. There is a constant stream of military equipment
going out of Antwerp harbour despite the Belgian government's claim
that they do not support the war. Yet I remain hopeful. Millions of
people marched around the world this past weekend against a war on
Iraq, and although there were only about 30 of us out against the
military ship tonight, we know we're in good company in opposing
this war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toes may now be numb from the cold, but are hearts are warm
and our spirits restless - let's all keep the pressure on for
peace.&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace joins participants of the World Social Forum in a protest against war with Iraq.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually it would take a major sporting event to unite so many
different types. But those attending the World Social Forum are
meeting to debate a concept even more unifying than athletic
pursuits - the idea that "another world is possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the World Social Forum is to create a truly open
discussion place for social movements, networks, non-government
organisations and other civil society organisations. The first
World Social Forum was held in 2001 to counter the World Economic
Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key issues to be tackled at this year's Forum is
corporate take-over of the world's staple food crops. Monsanto, the
company responsible for over 90 percent of all genetically
engineered crops grown in the world, is leading that take-over. As
part of the Forum, we released a &lt;a href="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1534/release1.0/www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/117606/0/MonsantoWSF.pdf"&gt;
briefing detailing Monsanto's role in forcing genetically
engineered crops into Brazil and the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;
(pdf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at the Forum, will also be supporting new renewable
energy, opposing nuclear power, and opposing war.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Exposing the dirty path of PVC</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stopping-pvc/</url><text>
	PVC doesn't look dangerous in the shop -- but look closely.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/plastic-pvc-bottles.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/plastic-pvc-bottles.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Plastic PVC bottles.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it ends up pumped out of factories in the form of
clean-looking, coloured window blinds, electrical cables or
children's toys, there is little evidence of the dirty and
dangerous path PVC has taken to reach its retail shape. Few think
of how it will end, too - in the landfill or burned in an
incinerator, with no possibility of recycling. Today Greenpeace
activists peacefully exposed one of the main steps in the
manufacture of the toxic plastic by blocking the Rhone a Fos canal
in Port-de-Bouc, France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atofina, a subsidiary of the petrochemical giant TotalFinaElf,
is better known for the explosion at their fertiliser plant in
Tolouse one year ago, which killed 30 people and injured thousands.
They are the largest PVC producers in France, which includes the
manufacture of its "building block", vinyl chloride monomer (VCM)
as well as toxic additives used for giving PVC different properties
in the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCM is a carcinogenic and highly explosive gas which is carried
in quantities of 2500 tonnes in a barge, three or four times a week
along the Rhone river between Marseille and Lyon. These transports
expose unaware communities along the river, with no proper safety
legislation to protect them, and today we were determined to
denounce this hazardous and irresponsible practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, beginning early morning, Greenpeace activists peacefully
blocked for 14 hours the Barcarin lock, on the Rhone a Fos canal,
to stop one of the VCM barges from going up the Rhone River to
Lyon. The activists unfurled a banner saying "Atofina - Stop PVC".
Forced from its original route along populated centers, and
prevented from going through the locks, the 2500-ton barge laden
with explosive products finally moored in harbour 1, in front of
the GDF methane globe, endangering safety and in spite of
Grenpeace's stated wish that it return to its origin at the
petrochemical port. "The director of the Atofina factory decided
that the barge and its cargo were no longer under his
responsibility, but that of the transporter", commented Yannick
Vicaire, toxics campaigner for Greenpeace France. "It is a transfer
of responsibilities that is incompatible with the safety of
dangerous transports".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PVC is a chlorinated plastic that poses numerous environmental
and health problems. Numerous toxic additives used in PVC products
contribute to contamination of the environment and the dioxins
released by incineration of wastes to contamination of the human
body. The market price of PVC does not reflect this - all the costs
to human health and the environment are (or will be) paid by
someone else. Given that all uses of PVC are substitutable by safe
or less problematic materials, is there any reason to keep making
this dangerous plastic? "The risks to the workers of Atofina and
the public are inadmissible because there are enormous hazards with
no benefits to society from the production of this plastic", said
Vicaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We won't negotiate under threat" declared the head of Atofina
Lavera. The real threat, though, is not peaceful protesters but
Atofina's transports of VCM four times a week, exposing unaware
communities to high risks not even covered by a proper industrial
safety legislation. Fittingly, Atofina's parent company,
TotalFinaElf, is no angel either. It was responsible for the Erika
oil spill in 1999, the Total La Mède refinery explosion in 1992 and
is accused of serious human rights violation in Myanmar
(Burma).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our action on Thursday is only the first episode in a peaceful
struggle against the wrongdoings of the PVC industry", concluded
Vicaire.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

oil refinery in South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists were on the ship from 7am to 1pm, one of them
locked to the anchor chain off the side of the vessel. It was an
uncomfortable wait as the heat of the day set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobil, also known as ExxonMobil and Esso, is the subject of an
international Greenpeace campaign because it is the oil company
with the worst position on climate change. Mobil was behind the US
Government's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, denies that burning
fossil fuels causes climate change and refuses to invest in clean
renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Dow's 'Vision of Zero'</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/dow-s-vision-of-zero/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Means zero responsiblilty and zero answers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After a very successful international call-in day to Dow Chemical, it is clear that Dow does not care what the public thinks. Dow shut down its public lines and refused to answer questions from thousands of concerned callers.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/1/skulls-of-the-victims-of-the-d.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Skulls of the victims of the disaster used to investigate the effects of the gas leak on the brain
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow shut down its &lt;a href="http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/ethics.htm"&gt;'ethics' line&lt;/a&gt; because it could not handle the high volume of calls. It replaced human operators with a pre-recorded message directing people to a website. The site offered for answers on Bhopal was, of course, the industry version of the events it likes to describe as an 'incident'. Bhopal.com can only be described as a smarmy public relations site full of misinformation. If Dow thinks the world's worst industrial disaster is only an incident then it obviously is not living in the real world. Maybe it thinks expensive lawyers and public relations can hide the truth from the public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Zero answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some of the issues Dow refused answer questions on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Why did Dow pay up for Union Carbide liabilities on asbestos in the US but refuse to even consider doing the same for Bhopal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Why, despite Union Carbide's lease agreement stating it must hand the chemical factory back clean, did it abandon the site strewn with toxic waste?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Why is Dow now suing the survivors in Bhopal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Your reaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow received calls from concerned people as far a field as Germany, Canada and New Zealand. Here are some quotes from people who called Dow yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This makes me so upset. Not only do they poison nearly 4000 people, but went on to sue the survivors. All they are doing is hanging up on people, and referring them to email. Ya know why? Email is easier to ignore." &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1043220457/1043332943"&gt;DinaNCW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I just called the Dow "Ethic line". As you surely already know, they recorded a message saying that for questions and comments about Bhopal people can go to www.bhopal.com. I talked to a woman then, who just repeated the same sentence, and when I said that providing "infos" on a website was not fair, and I asked about the suit against the survivors, she replied that the only answer she or anyone else at that phone number were allowed to give was: go to the website, write to the email address." &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1043220457/1043225532"&gt;Paola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to know why Dow wasn't cleaning up the site and had even suggested that any cleanup be paid for out of the funds raised for the victims. The woman said she was going to hang up and did so after telling me to "have a nice day" &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1043220457/1043248516"&gt;Julie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I then asked why it was only available for Dow employees when death, disfigurement and disability had been inflicted upon the inhabitants of Bhopal. I will follow up with a letter to the Houston address given in the recorded message." &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1043220457/1043255808"&gt;greta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;No answers means more questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another call shows the effect of Dow's dodging valid concerns from the public has on perceptions of a company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just called the North America number (800-447-4369) at 11:45 (PST). Like many of you I got the standard line about Bhopal.com and I can voice my concerns in writing to the Bhopal.com information center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally I will write but I won't be sending anything to the above address; I think I will send a copy of my letter to all the 'top brass' at DOW." &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1043220457/1043265059"&gt;Mike Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	While Dow executives chatted with fellow business leaders at the World Economic Forum's 'Building Trust' annual meeting, we delivered a reality check. Thirty Greenpeace activists representing the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal (ICJB) transferred eighteen barrels of poisonous waste to Dow's European headquarters in Horgen, Switzerland. Others beat drums urging the US chemical giant to stop poisoning people and clean up its toxic mess in India.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Thirty Greenpeace activists, constituent of the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal, delivered eighteen barrels of poisonous waste collected from Bhopal, India to Dow's European headquarters in Horgen, Switzerland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 300 kg of poisonous waste is only a fraction of hundreds of tonnes that have been strewn around the derelict pesticide plant in Bhopal since 1984 when Union Carbide, which is now owned by Dow, fled the city after a gas leak at the plant killed 8,000 people and injured half a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the eighteen barrels of delivered waste represents a year that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it has been left to leak into the soil and ground water around the factory site and poison people who survived the gas leak. The death toll currently stands at 20,000 and is rising every day. Children born to survivors are suffering health problems and 150,000 people are in urgent need of medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow's audacity to discuss matters of trust while refusing to accept responsibility for the pollution they caused is sickening. Meanwhile, confidential internal Union Carbide documents recently released by US courts show that the company knew about the problems in Bhopal but misled the public and the Indian authorities by saying the site was clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We join the ICJB in calling on Dow to clean up the site, as well as provide people with clean drinking water, long-term medical care and full compensation. International legislation should be put in place to make sure companies such as Dow are held responsible for pollution or accidents their operations cause, wherever they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace boards single-hull tanker in Gibraltar</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-boards-single-hull/</url><text>
	The cleanup of some 25,000 tonnes of oil from the sunken Prestige oil tanker continues along the coasts of Spain, France and Portugal. But single hull tankers are still a permanent presence in the region. Greenpeace activists boarded the single hull oil tanker Vemamagna in Algeciras Bay, Gibraltar today climbing the mast with banners reading "Oil Hazard" in English and Spanish.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/1/gibraltar-authorities-detain-a.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/1/gibraltar-authorities-detain-a.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Gibraltar authorities detain a Greenpeace inflatable following a Greenpeace protest against the single hulled oil tanker Vemamagna anchored in Algeciras Bay, Gibraltar today.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Lopez de Uralde from Greenpeace says despite the sinking of
the Prestige, European policy regarding the transport of hazardous
substances has not changed substantially. "Another catastrophe can
occur at any time and Algeciras Bay is literally a time bomb
waiting to explode. We want an urgent and total ban on single-hull
tankers and the establishment of a new regime of unlimited
responsibility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Spanish government data, in 2001 over 56,670
merchant ships crossed the Gibraltar Strait. Ten percent of all
international maritime traffic crosses the Strait and around 5000
oil tankers travel the same route every year. That's about 10 to 15
oil tankers a day. Approximately 20 million tonnes of oil products
are transported annually through the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Gibraltar authorities believe Greenpeace activists pose
more of a threat than rusting oil tankers and have detained two
inflatable boats Greenpeace activists were using when they began
their protest. Onboard these boats were a total of 12 journalists
and eight activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibraltar's complicity with the oil industry is unacceptable.
Gibraltar is playing Russian roulette with the marine environment
allowing high risk practices as those being carried out by the
Vemamagna and by avoiding a ban on single-hulled vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want full and unlimited liability throughout the chain of
responsibilities, including the owners, managers and operators of a
vessel and of any charterers or owners of the cargo. Additionally,
Greenpeace is demanding that the EU immediately ban the use of
single hulled tankers and exclude ecologically sensitive areas from
shipping routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vemamagna is a 22 year old single hull vessel belonging to
the Vemaoil Company based in Gibraltar but is registered in
Malta.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finnish government takes a chainsaw to the last of their forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finnish-government-takes-the-c/</url><text>
	Some 30 countries throughout eastern and western Europe have no intact ancient forest left. Finland retains only about five percent of the old-growth  boreal forests that once covered most of the country, but now even that is under threat, and by the government's own forestry company.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Finnish forest slated for logging which will begin any day.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish state owned forestry enterprise Metsahallitus is
planning to start logging the old-growth forests of Malahvia, in
the north eastern part of Finland close to the Russian border.
Metsahallitus plans to commence both clearcutting and selective
logging in the area despite clear scientific evidence about the
high biological value of the Malahvia forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This old growth forest of almost 4000 hectares includes
unditched bogs, streams, lakes and ponds. Rare and declining animal
and plant species that depend on old growth forest conditions are
common in this area. The forest is one of Finland's important homes
for once numerous species like the Siberian Jay and Three-toed
Woodpecker which have declined alarmingly since the late 1940s.
Some of the species that make their home in the Malahvia forest are
already endangered and still more are on the verge of becoming
endangered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest of Malahvia is part of a green belt of old-growth
forests in Finland and an inseparable part of one of the most
important hot spots of boreal biodiversity in Scandinavia and
north-western Russia. Its natural features should be maintained and
enhanced rather than further logged and fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research conducted by authorities working for the
same government that plans to log this area, similar numbers of
endangered species are found in only a few places in Finland.
Reports by the environmental authorities go on to say that "...this
is a forest site of major importance even on a national scale,
whose diverse insect fauna and other endangered species will be
saved only if no further fragmentation takes place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local residents have appealed to the Finnish Ministry of the
Environment and the logging company Metsahallitus not to log the
forests in the area. But bulldozers already carved two forestry
roads into the area in December and logging operations are about to
start any day now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=475&amp;amp;s=for"&gt;Please

	In a warning to all irresponsible companies, Italian authorities recently arrested 18 executives and managers of the Italian chemicals firm, Enichem. The company was discovered to be pouring deadly toxic waste directly into the environment with the full knowledge of the company bosses. Ten Enichem employees have been jailed while the others are under house arrest.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Action at Enichem plant
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation began last September when a group of residents
observed an unusual red tinted waste stream flowing into the sea
out of a pipe used by the Enichem factories in Priolo and Gela,
Sicily. Local authorities pursued the lead, sampling the discharge
and tapping Enichem's phone lines. Listening to phone conversations
the investigators discovered that Enichem managers knew about the
illegal discharge but simply did not care - despite the fact that
mercury concentrations found in the waste waters were up to 20,000
times higher than legal limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enichem plants manufacture chlorine which is used in the
manufacturing of Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM). VCM is the building
block of the common plastic, PVC, but is also a potent cancer
causing chemical. The plants are located in a petrochemical complex
where health studies have shown a disturbing trend of illnesses and
birth defects in the nearby communities. Babies born near the
industrial area have a five times higher chance to be born with
birth defects. Heart disease around the area is also 5 times the
national average and there are increased levels of cancer among men
living in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local groups including doctors have taken legal action against
Priolo industries, but until now no one has attempted to reverse
the situation or better understand the role of industrial pollution
in the case of human health problems. In the past workers at the
Enichem plant have complained about exposure to harmful chemicals
from air emissions. Last year, public prosecutors shut down
electricity production inside the chemical plant for illegally
burning hazardous waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the Eni Group's web site provides a glimpse into
the display of hypocrisy and greenwash so typical of today's
corporate public relations: "The safeguard of health, the safety in
the workplace and in the management of productive plants and the
protection of the environment are major objectives for Eni in the
strategies and plans of the Group. This choice is in accordance
with the conviction that Eni's economic development is compatible
with the respect for nature and the well-being of people."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But words are cheap and do nothing to heal the devastation
caused by the birth of a malformed baby or a man stricken with
cancer in the prime of life. It certainly did not help the
surviving families last year when Enichem and Montedison were
acquitted of charges for mass manslaughter of 260 workers who died
from cancer and other illnesses as a result of exposure to VCM in
the town of Marghera in northern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enichem's claims of ignorance concerning the toxicity of the
chemicals it used and produced in Marghera merely reinforces the
desperate need to make corporations responsible and liable for the
safety of the chemicals they produce and release into the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For arrested Enichem executives Giuseppe D'Arrigo, Giuseppe
Rivoli and Gaetano Claves, there is now plenty of time to
contemplate whether it really was worth cutting costs and risking
other people's lives to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

	Another oil spill, slick black waters, dead birds, local fishermen's livelihoods ruined. However this spill was not caused by the usual suspects of shady operators running rusting tankers. This spill was cause by the world's biggest cement multinational Holcim based in Switzerland.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Holcim's workers with no proper equipment removing the oil spill caused by a technical fault at their plant in Kefraya, North of Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the evening of January 5th there was a spill of 50 tonnes of
fueloil at the company's plant in north Lebanon. The oil is used to
fuelthe cement kilns at the plant. When we exposed the spill the
followingday Holcim accepted responsibility. However the clean up
by the companyhas, so far, been completely inadequate, putting the
environment andthe workers at further risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to the spill has been very slow with the clean up
stillgoing on one week after the spill. Company workers on the
clean upteams lack protective clothing and there is no professional
supervisionto properly clean up the oil. Rocky shores are being
cleaned withoutthe use of the specialised techniques required and
neither the companyor the authorities have fully surveyed the area
to determine the extentof the spill and damage caused. The latest
'solution' proposed byHolcim is to concrete over the rocky areas
polluted by the spill. Maybea great use for some leftover Holcim
cement but not exactly aenvironmentally sound clean up
technique!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holcim knows that it would not be allowed to get away with such
asubstandard response in Europe, but the lack of regulations
andenforcement in developing countries are exploited by companies
likeHolcim where profit is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holcim already has a bad environmental track record. It
continues toburn hazardous waste as fuel in its cement kilns. This
is one of themost polluting methods to deal with hazardous waste as
it spreadspollution to the air and also into the final product,
cement. So ifyour home is built using Holcim cement, from kilns
burning hazardouswaste, there is a fair chance you also have
harmful chemicals in yourwalls. As an industry giant, Holcim should
be leading the cementindustry away from this environmentally
destructive and dangerouspractice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the latest example of how multinationals exploit
theenvironment and people of the developing world for profit. What
isneeded is international laws to hold corporations criminally
andfinancially liable for damage and compensation for victims
ofindustrial disasters and damage to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;Multinationals like Holcim, Dow and
&lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;Exxon&lt;/a&gt;,including the
individuals responsible for illicit or immoral decisions,must not
be allowed to hide behind legal clutter, or to undulyinfluence or
buy governments to avoid their responsibilities andpromote
self-serving policies.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Logging fuels African conflict</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/logging-fuels-african-conflict/</url><text>
	Greenpeace activists in Italy exposed the import of logs from Liberia in the port of Ravenna which are helping to fuel a civil war in West Africa. New evidence reveals that the president and chief shareholder of the timber company has helped import weapons into Liberia destined for use by Liberian-backed rebels in Cote d'Ivoire. These logs are responsible for more than just forest destruction.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/activists-paint-liberian-logs.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists paint Liberian logs with 'Logs of War' and 'Forest Crime' in the Italian port of Ravenna.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging is a lucrative business in poverty-stricken Liberia and
has long been one of the prime sources of government revenue.
Following a United Nations ban on all diamond exports from Liberia
in 2001, logging has become the single largest source of export
earnings for the Liberian government. But at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of excessive exploitation throughout western Africa,
Liberia's forest now represents almost half of what remains of a
rainforest belt that once covered the whole of Liberia, plus parts
of Sierra Leone, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Togo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forest is home to some 9,000 species of plants and more
than 1,300 species of animals. It supports the only viable
populations of the pygmy hippopotamus and represents the last
stronghold of the forest elephant in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberia's forest is also the lifeline of the country's
indigenous communities. The forest provides shelter for their
physical, cultural and religious life, including hosting shrines,
traditional bush schools and cover for streams. It is also a vital
source of foods, medicinal herbs and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial logging has already destroyed much of the accessible
lowland and coastal regions of West Africa's tropical forests. It
is estimated that almost 90 percent of these forests have already
been destroyed and what remains is heavily fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent reports by a Panel of Experts to the UN Security Council
reveal that the Liberian timber industry is involved in both
environmental destruction and human rights abuses. This includes
driving the destruction of the Liberia's remaining forests and
illegal arms trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 70 percent of the wood produced in Liberia is destined
for the export market. The key actors driving this destructive,
corrupt and destabilizing industry are the countries and companies
importing the timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberia's main log exports have traditionally been to Europe
with 12 percent destined for Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we confronted the Italian Timber Importer Federation
about the presence of Liberian timber on the Italian market. After
several meetings, the federation members agreed to stop the import
of timber from companies linked with the illicit arms trade and
illegal logging operations. Despite this promise a number of
Italian importers continue to import Liberia logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists uncovered such a shipment in the Italian
port of Ravenna coming from a company heavily linked with the
illicit arms trade to Liberia. The timber comes from the Liberia
company Maryland Wood Processing Industries (MWPI) whose president
has been linked to the illegal trade of weapons in the expert panel
report of the UN Security Council&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian timber industry has failed to take into account the
UN Security Council's evidence showing of the role of the Liberian
logging industry in fuelling regional conflict in West Africa. It's
time for Italian importers to live up to their words and
immediately stop buying conflict timber from countries like
Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian government said it would be in the front line
against terrorism and international insecurity, but at the same
time Italy is still importing timber which is fuelling the civil
war in West Africa and the illegal arms trade. Companies like MWPI
illustrate the link between war, conflicts on natural resources and
environmental destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Italian government to ban all import of
timber coming from Liberia until it can be shown that the timber
industry no longer fuels regional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help by not buying timber from Liberia and &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.com/forms/gpicontr.html"&gt;helping to
support our ancient forest campaign to protect the world's
remaining ancient forests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	An extraordinary communication from the United States to UN representatives around the world has been leaked to Greenpeace.(Full text of the leaked document here). In it, the United States warns that the simple act of support for a General Assembly meeting to discuss the war will be considered "unhelpful and directed against the United States."  They further threaten that invoking the Uniting for Peace resolution will be "harmful to the UN."
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists anchored a large banner to a boat today, reading 'When Will the U.S. Disarm? No War' and sailed it in front of the United Nations headquarters.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been actively lobbying at the United Nations
against the war, and many delegates have expressed both publicly
and privately their distaste for what they see as US attempts to
"strongarm" the world community to do as it is told. One delegate
was so incensed with the memo circulated by the US that he leaked
the full document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uniting for Peace resolution, which the US is trying to head
off, has a long history of stopping conflict. Ironically, it has
most often been invoked by the US to overcome vetoes by the Soviet
Union during the cold war. Under its terms, the full 191 member
United Nations General Assembly can gather to make recommendations
for restoring the peace when the Security Council is deadlocked or
unable to take action. Somewhat hilariously, one of the reasons the
US says the General Assembly should not take up the issue of war in
Iraq is that the "Security Council remains seized of this matter."
Seized is certainly the correct term: the engine of peace is simply
not turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who say that the United Nations has been harmed
by the Security Council debate on Iraq and the US coalition action
without authorisation. However, it can also be said that the UN
showed extraordinary strength in withstanding the pressure to
rubber-stamp an illegal invasion. The only course of action open
now to the global community is to demand the immediate end of
hostilities and a return to UN-sanctioned disarmament measures.
It's the right thing to do for world peace, it's the right thing to
do for the future of the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two weeks, Greenpeace Cyberactivists have been part
of the global outcry for an emergency session of the UN. We've sent
a record 60,000 appeals to United Nations representatives calling
for the General Assembly to denounce the war in Iraq and to call
for an immediate cease-fire. And despite the fierce US pressure, it
looks like our global demand will be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A press announcement by the Arab League Monday confirms that
they will be invoking the "Uniting for Peace" resolution to bring
all 191 member nations of the UN together. "The point of the
request is to save the lives of Iraqi civilians," one Arab diplomat
said to the Associated Press. "We will ask for a cease-fire and a
return to peaceful disarmament in Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of other nations have already gone on record saying they
will support the call for an emergency session. We urge the General
Assembly to meet swiftly and give shape to the global voices that
are demanding an end to this illegal war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=733&amp;amp;s=wr"&gt;Please
write to the Foreign Ministers of Cuba, South Africa, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Nigeria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Fiji, Mexico, Chile,
Germany, Russia, and France, and ask them to support 'Uniting for
Peace' You can write all of them by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ecs/s2?i=730&amp;amp;sk=std"&gt;If
you've already done that, you can send an e-card to your friends
and colleagues asking them to support the Uniting for Peace
resolution as well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/war/"&gt;And if you've done
both of those things, please help Greenpeace continue its work
against this war by becoming a financial supporter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	"Frustrated with the United Nations' consistent, blatant regard for the will of its 188 member nations, the US announced Monday the formation of its own international governing body, the USUN." Some would merely laugh off this satirical story in America's Finest News Source, The Onion. But as the Arab League calls for an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to halt the illegal, unilateral war on Iraq we must ask, is it really just a laugh?
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists stage action in front of Hong Kong Legislative Council, calling on the government not to be complicit in the illegal war on Iraq
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US, UK and Spain refused to get the backing of the UN
Security Council for a war on Iraq saying that France would clog up
the system with its veto. But now that the Security Council will
vote on a resolution calling for a ceasefire and to condemn the war
on Iraq, it seems certain that the US and UK will use their veto to
block the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking all over international treaties like sand in the
dessert, the US is ignoring one of the founding principles of the
United Nations. UN Charter Article 51 gives states a sovereign
right to start military action in self-defense only if they have
suffered an armed attack. There is no basis in international law
for the use of force as a preventive measure when there has been no
actual or imminent attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step the Arab League can call for an emergency session
of the UN General Assembly invoked under UN Resolution 377, known
as Uniting for Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolution 377 can be called either by a majority of the members
of the UN Security Council, or by a majority of the General
Assembly. It has been invoked 10 times in the last 50 years, when
the Security Council, due to a 'lack of unanimity' among the
permanent members, is unable to perform its primary task of
maintaining international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time that the US and UK governments are confronted by the
breadth and depth of global opposition to this illegal war. If a
resolution is tabled, an overwhelming majority of UN member states
will support it, reflecting both a desire to respect international
law as well as the overwhelming global public opposition to US
unilateralism and to the loss of life in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already reports that the US and the UK have been
threatening countries with reprisals if they invoke 'Uniting for
Peace'. But we must all take a stand together against a new world
order dictated by the US, and use every legal instrument available
within the UN system to stop the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we won't be laughing much longer when the US says "I
can't tell you how much easier it is to achieve consensus when you
don't have to worry about dissent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/aas/e?a=ufp&amp;amp;s=amb_s"&gt;Join
the coalition of the UNwilling&lt;/a&gt; calling for a emergency session

&lt;p&gt;The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal (ICJB) returned contaminated drinking water from Bhopal, India, to Dow Chemical's Texas headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists blocked the entrances to the Houston Dow Center after delivering 250 gallons of contaminated water taken from wells in Bhopal, the site of the world's worst industrial disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water, the same water that the people of Bhopal are forced to drink everyday, was removed from the scene by a hazardous materials team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestors from across the United States demanded that Dow meet with Bhopal survivors to discuss their legitimate grievances and that the company drop two civil suits it has filed in India against Bhopal survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blockade comes on the heels of a virtual sit in that started yesterday and will continue until Dow drops the court case against the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

	The leaders of the most powerful nations on Earth have failed us. The Security Council has failed us. War has begun.  The UN should not allow itself to be relegated to a strictly humanitarian role: it is their moment to stand up and give voice to the global demand to stop the fighting.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a need for the United Nations to rise to the
challenge it was conceived to meet, now is that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the majority of world opinion stands opposed to war, who
should represent those voices in the halls of the United Nations?
The Security Council was built on the premise that the strongest
nations, those with nuclear weapons, should have an unequal say in
what's right and what's wrong. The five permanent members of the UN
all hold vetoes, and while they may have been deadlocked over a
motion to authorise force against Iraq, they would be equally
deadlocked should anyone introduce a resolution condemning the US
for acting without that authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so the General Assembly, in which all nations participate
equally. Through a little-used mechanism known as Resolution 377A,
the "Uniting for Peace" resolution, the General Assembly may be the
last hope for disarming Iraq peaceably and stopping the US war
machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uniting for Peace resolution empowers the General Assembly
to meet in emergency session to address acts of aggression or a
breach of the peace when the Security Council has been unable to
act. Its was first used to bring about a cease-fire in the Suez
crisis of 1950, forcing Britain and France to withdraw from Egypt
within a week, even after they had vetoed calls for a cease-fire in
the Security Council. It has been used ten times since then, most
often at the request of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Assembly can meet immediately and recommend
collective measures to UN members to "maintain or restore
international peace and security," including the deployment of
peace-keeping forces. But more importantly, the General Assembly
can give political shape to the world-wide outcry against this war.
A war that has until now simply not been authorised by the gathered
nations of the world should now be forcefully condemned, and those
responsible for crimes against innocent victims be called to
justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe, as we do, that the very future of the world, and
of the United Nations, is being put at risk in the name of a
pre-emptive war, please &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/aas/e?a=ufp&amp;amp;s=amb_s"&gt;join the
call for the UN General Assembly to respond.&lt;/a&gt; Ask that the
Uniting for Peace resolution be invoked, that the war on Iraq be
condemned, and that peaceable means of disarming Iraq be
sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next hours may provide our last chance to change a dangerous
course of history. The United Nations must not allow a world order
based on multilateralism to be replaced with one in which the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mightiest and richest make the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/aas/e?a=ufp&amp;amp;s=amb_s"&gt;Take
action now -- ask the UN to convene an emergency session under the
Uniting for Peace resolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It could be just days before the US goes to war in Iraq and still supplies for the war machine are on route. The Rainbow Warrior blocked the US and Spanish military port of Rota in the south of Spain, trying to stop the US military cargo ship Cape Horn from leaving port for the Gulf.   The ship was boarded and several crew members were arrested.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior captain Daniel Rizzoti was arrested among others by the Spanish Guardia Civil. The Rainbow Warrior was boarded last night while protesting in front of Rota Naval Base.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we even finished our coffee this morning we were
surrounded by police boats and a helicopter was on the scene. At
around 8:30 we heard radio transmission that the Cape Horn, a
massive military cargo ship headed for the Gulf was preparing to
leave. It wasn't long after that we saw military tug boats heading
into the port to help maneuver the large vessel out of the
port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within half an hour we had four inflatable boats in the
water with activists, the Rainbow Warrior had started engines and
we were raising the anchor. By this time there were another three
military ships around us. To our surprise and delight they started
to head out to sea, where did they think we were going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the inflatables we headed towards the entrance of the
port, a narrow passage we can block and prevent the war machine
from leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small police boats and helicopter quickly caught up with our
activists while the military ships were already too far out to stop
us. We are going to stop this military cargo from supplying this
illegal and immoral war against Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 9:30 the Rainbow Warrior was in position in front of the port
entrance and we dropped our anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already two activists, an American man and Spanish woman, have
been arrested as they attempted to chain themselves to buoys on the
gate to the port. The police have also seized one of our
inflatables but the boat crew were able to avoid arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to stay and stop this military cargo ship. The
Spanish government is supporting a war on Iraq both politically at
the UN and on the ground here in Rota, but the Spanish people are
against this war. We are here stopping this shipment on behalf of
the 90 percent of Spanish people who oppose the war with or without
a UN resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

	The little known west African state of Guinea Bissau, sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, includes the Bijagos Archipelagos. The islands are home to a huge range of wildlife and are an internationally recognised wildlife reserve and important local fisheries. Sounds like a fabulous place to dump toxic ships, doesn't it?
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Ship breaking yard in India. The problem of ships containing toxic waste is exported to poor countries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archipelago has been protected as a UNESCO biosphere reserve
since 1993. It is known for a diverse range of wildlife, including
sea cows, hippopotamus, otters, six species of sea turtles and two
species of salt-water crocodiles. There are 700,000 migratory birds
and numerous local bird species living in and around the
archipelago. Fishing is the major source of income for locals in
Guinea Bissau. Despite this ecological heritage Spanish shipping
companies want to develop the island of Bolama as a scrap yard for
obsolete ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company DDY De Comercio Exterior SA has a preliminary
agreement with the Guinea-Bissau government to build the scrap yard
alongside the two national parks on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toxic campaigner, Marietta Harjono has seen first hand what
happens at scrap yards in Asia: "A shipbreaking yard will bring
some of the most dangerous substances known to science to Guinea
Bissau, and put the lives and environment of local people at
serious risk. We know from experience in India, Pakistan and other
developing countries that scrap ships contain hazardous materials
and oil residues. The shipping industry must not be allowed to send
hazardous waste to developing countries, and especially to a site
of such environmental importance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the companies involved claim the development will be
'sustainable', local groups say the companies chose Guinea Bissau
because it has not signed an international treaty to control the
export of hazardous waste to developing countries. Hardly bodes
well for the companies promises when they chose somewhere where
rules can be evaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these companies are serious about a sustainable solution for
scrapping ships then they should be supporting regulations under
discussion at the International Maritime Organisation to ensure
ship owners clean and decontaminate ships before scrapping. That's
a lot more sustainable than looking to exploit developing countries
and pollute the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Act:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=766&amp;amp;s=ship"&gt;Email
UNESCO now&lt;/a&gt; to tell it to protect the islands against the threat
of the scrap yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you connected to the shipping industry, a shipspotter, a
harbourmaster, a crew member or in any other way able to know the
positions of ships? &lt;a href="http://greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/finalvoyage.asp"&gt;We need

	It is spring in Spain, the sun is shining and the countryside is being covered in a blanket of green, fragrant yellow flowers are growing on gently rolling hills. No wait, those are not hills, they are ammunitions bunkers buried in the ground behind three razor wire fences guarded by video cameras and regular patrols on a joint US and Spanish military base.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior is in Cadiz in the southwestern part of Spain for its latest stop campaigning against war.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region may be springing to life, but the Spanish government
is marching head long into a war in Iraq with the US and UK where
half of the casualties could be innocent children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is now in Cadiz on the southwest coast of
Spain not far from the Rota naval base, a joint operation with the
US military. Everyday military and civilian ships are coming and
going from the port with supplies for the war, but you would't have
to look far to find opposition to the Spanish government's
involvement in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the little town of Rota built upon the wealth of the
base, there are many posters saying no to war. In fact, 94 percent
of the population of Spain is against this war, with or without the
backing of the United Nations. Only three percent support a war.
All over town in Cadiz as well there are posters and big hand made
banners on cotton sheets hanging off balconies saying "No a la
Guerra".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Spain are against this war, all the government
opposition parties are against the war. But the Spanish government
continues to support Bush and Blair and is backing them at the UN
Security Council hoping to pass a second resolution in the coming
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seems the government is not oblivious to the opposition,
as reported by the national Spanish newspaper El Mundo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Also, the presence in Cadiz of the Rainbow Warrior, the
flagship of Greenpeace, has made the Ministry of Foreign affairs
somewhat nervous. The constant transit of EU military ships through
the Straight could produce a great incident. According to Juan Jose
Navarro, in Cadiz, Greenpeace has not ruled out any protests at the
naval base of Rota. 'The government must abandon their shameful
warmongering stance,' says Carlos Bravo of Greenpeace."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/26064/carlos.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left"&gt;Carlos, a Greenpeace
nuclear and disarmament campaign for Greenpeace in Spain, &lt;a href="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1534/release1.0/www.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/170579/0/carlos.mp3"&gt;
talks more about the Spanish government's support for the war&lt;/a&gt;
and the overwhelming public opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

	Dow Chemical is going to court soon in India. Not as the defendants for their ongoing responsibility for the Bhopal disaster, but as the plaintiffs. They're suing (we're not making this up) the SURVIVORS of the disaster for protesting at a Dow plant.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/12/victims-of-the-bhopal-disaster.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/12/victims-of-the-bhopal-disaster.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Victims of the Bhopal disaster protest outside Dow's headquarters in Bombay. Dow wants US$10,000 compensation from the survivors for this peaceful protest.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also pressing for US$10,000 in compensation from the survivors for previous peaceful protests. Dow wants the courts to order the survivors to physically stay away from Dow plants and Dow employees. (The technical term for this legal ploy is the "out of sight, out of mind defence." OK, we made that up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pesky internet activists are showing Dow there is no escape, and providing survivors with a way they can stay far away from Dow plants and Dow employees, but still exercise their right to protest and demand accountability of Dow: a virtual sit-in at Dow's world-wide greenwash headquarters on the internet, www.bhopal.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dowethics.com/bhopal.com/go/visit.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This protest starts on Monday 10 March and will continue untill Dow drops the court case against the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow's unapologetic website, which includes an "incident review," denies that Dow purchased any liability for the disaster when they bought Union Carbide, which was the majority stakeholder in the Bhopal plant. The site also claims that "The legacy of those killed and injured is a chemical industry that adheres voluntarily to strict safety and environmental standards." You may want to read that sentence again just to be sure you got it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Virtual sit in?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual sit-in is simply an automated way of sending lots of traffic to a website. Activists around the world park their browsers on a page which does nothing more than automatically load the bhopal.com site several times a minute. In the same way that a real-world sit-in disrupts traffic, the virtual sit-in makes the target site less responsive and slow. Eventually, the site may become so crowded with protestors that it stops serving information completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sit in was the idea of the legendary internet activist group &lt;a href="http://www.theyesmen.org/"&gt;the yesmen&lt;/a&gt; who have already been giving Dow a black eye with &lt;a href="http://dowethics.com/r/Homepage/index.html"&gt;dowethics.com&lt;/a&gt;. Andy Bichlbaum from the group said: "We're going to continue representing Dow more honestly than they represent themselves until Dow decides to fulfill its responsibilites in Bhopal. And this protest is going to continue until Dow drops its court case against the survivors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The ongoing disaster in Bhopal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 1984 gas leak, which has killed 20,000 people to date, Union Carbide abandoned the factory site and fled India. For 18 years since, the toxic wastes left by Union Carbide have been bleeding poisons into the groundwater and affecting the health of the people living near the factory. Dow merged with Union Carbide in 2001 and despite paying up for Union Carbide's asbestos liabilities, it refuses to do the same for Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow has faced may protests since taking over Union Carbide but suing the victims represent a new low in Dow's attempts to gag its critics. Most of the survivors come from the poorest sections of Indian society. Despite this Dow is not only attempting to prevent peaceful protests at Dow locations but is asking for a monetary settlement from the victims. The amount it seeks represents an average survivors earnings over 10 to 20 years. The cause? Dow's "loss of business".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual sit-in, organised by the yesmen, follows on from their hugely successful spoof of Dow's website, currently located at &lt;a href="http://dowethics.com/r/Homepage/index.html"&gt;www.dowethics.com&lt;/a&gt;. Dow has been playing whack-a-mole with the site, launching several abortive legal attempts to shut it down, only to have new activists set it up in a new spot on the interent. The site takes a slightly more honest look at why Dow refuses to clean up Bhopal and why image is everything to Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this protest will help show Dow that the only way to really silence protest will be to spend a fraction of its huge US$28 billion annual turnover on cleaning up Bhopal?&lt;/p&gt;

	Genetically engineered (GE) crops, as any other living organism, grow and reproduce. That's why genetic contamination is a problem with the potential to multiply.  A proposal in the EU aims to put the burden of controlling contamination onto farmers seeking to keep their fields GE-free.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace marks a maize field with signs showing corn with a 'question mark' indicating that 1 in 200 maize crops  can be genetically contaminated if the draft EU seed directive is passed .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once GE crops are planted on a commercial scale, the measures to
avoid contamination can substantially increase the final cost of
conventional and organic products. The EU Joint Research Centre has
calculated an increase of costs as high as 41 percent for oilseed
rape seed production, and 9 percent for conventional maize
production in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would think that politicians would see it as their
responsibility to prevent genetic contamination from happening.
However, this doesn't seem to be the case in the European Union
(EU). An unpublished "Communication on Co-existence," which
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler will soon present, takes
the view that legislative action at European Community level should
be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the Commission's Agriculture Services considers an
approach where preventative action would be limited to coordinating
and advisory functions. They also assume that Co-existence measures
should be strictly limited to the economic aspects of genetic
contamination and propose that seeds contaminated below certain
threshold (0.3 - 0.7 percent depending on the crop) should not even
need to be labelled as genetically modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only comprehensive legislation can save the purity of seeds,
ensure the survival of uncontaminated conventional and organic
farming in Europe and ensure the right of consumers and farmers to
say "no" to GE products. Clear liability regulations following the
"polluter pays" principle must ensure that extra costs are borne by
the producers and growers of GE crops responsible for the
contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the leaked Communication argues that the burden of
Co-existence measures "should fall on the economic operators
(farmers, seed suppliers, etc.) who intend to gain a benefit from
the specific cultivation model they have chosen." According to this
view, farmers who have an economic interest in ensuring that their
products remain GE-free, would have to pay to avoid contamination
instead of those responsible for the contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call on decision-makers in the EU to adopt clear and
effective legislation to protect the agricultural assets of Europe
and prevent genetic contamination. Failure to do so could have
severe consequences: environmental damage to farmland and
biodiversity, economic loss for conventional and organic farmers,
and higher prices for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the overwhelming majority of consumers who want to buy and eat
non-GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	The "yellowcake" sample we delivered to Paul Bremer, head of the US civil administration in Iraq, is safely contained - but who knows how much is still left unsecured and unsafe in the local community.  We brought  Mr Bremer a container of the radioactive uranium found abandoned near the Tuwaitha nuclear facility and urged him to allow the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out a full survey and decontamination of Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace delivers a container of radioactive uranium'yellow cake  found abandoned in the community outside the Tuwaitha nuclear facility, to Mr Bremmer, head of US civil administration in Baghdad.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving outside the Office of Rehabilitation and
Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) - now located in one of Saddam
Hussein's palaces in Baghdad - we challenged Mr Bremer to accept
responsibility for the "yellowcake" and for the rest of the
radioactive material that is contaminating the environment and
threatening public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Administration insists there is no danger or health risk
to the villages, despite evidence of widespread radioactive
contamination in the area, after the facility was left unsecured at
the end of the war and was subsequently looted. Authorities allowed
the IAEA into Tuwaitha last month, but only to make an inventory of
uranium inside part of the nuclear facility, not in the surrounding
communities. They were refused permission to inventory any of the
400 highly radioactive sources known to have been at Tuwaitha
before the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been surveying the villages around Tuwaitha for
the past three weeks and has found frightening levels of
radioactivity including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge uranium "yellowcake" mixing canister with about 4-5
kilos of powder still inside, left open and abandoned on a field
near a village&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;radioactivity in a series of houses, including one source
measuring 10,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another source outside a 900 pupil primary school measuring
3,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;locals who are still storing radioactive barrels and lids in
their houses&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a smaller radioactive source abandoned in a nearby field&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;consistent and repeated stories of unusual sickness after
coming into contact with material from the Tuwaitha plant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;numerous objects, carrying radioactive symbols, discarded in
the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

None of this nuclear material is prohibited by UN resolutions or is
usable for nuclear weapons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community near Tuwaitha is suffering a nuclear disaster that
would be tolerated nowhere else in the world. Even the US
military's own radiation expert in Iraq agrees that a major
decontamination and health screening programme is urgently
needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would recommend the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
and the World Health Organisation get involved and do an
assessment. They've got involved in other instances like in Brazil
where sources have ended up being distributed in the community and
they actually assessed the risks from that. The faster it happens
the better," said Lt. Col Mark Melanson, radiation expert and head
of the US Military Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine unit in
Iraq, in a Greenpeace interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we we spoke with Dr Emad Aldin, Health Physicist, Iraq
Atomic Energy Commission, he agreed: "To deal with this crisis and
to solve this problem and pass through this mess we need all the
help from the United States as the occupying force, and the
international organisations like the IAEA and the WHO. If these
efforts are united that will solve the problem as quickly as we
hope."&lt;/p&gt;

	We gave two sacks of soy contaminated with Monsanto's genetically engineered (GE) varieties to Pascal Lamy (EU Trade Commissioner) and asked him to send them back to his US counterpart, Robert Zoellick. The right to say no to genetically engineered (GE) food should be available not just to Europeans, but to everyone around the world. We urge the EU to stand strong at the WTO meeting in Cancun in September, and not cave in to US pressure on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are a biosafety issue, not a trade issue.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy receives from Greenpeace Italy Genetic Engineering campaigner Federica Ferrario sacks of soy contaminated with genetically engineered (GE) varieties by the US-multinational GE company Monsanto.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From field to fork, the food we eat and the seeds we plant in
our fields are being targeted by multinationals, which are
attempting a corporate take-over of the entire food chain. They are
seeking to reduce everything to a trade issue, including
environmental and social concerns, which are brushed aside as
unfair trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the EU has just adopted the world's strongest rules
on the labelling of GMOs. To the GE industry and its backers in the
Bush Administration, the rules are a threat to their plans to
force-feed the world GMOs, because they not only help to identify
and exclude GE ingredients in Europe, but also serve as model
legislation for other countries planning to regulate GMOs. The US
is, therefore, challenging the EU's GMO policy through the WTO and
is expected to broaden its complaint against the EU's GMO
moratorium, to include opposing the EU's new GMO labelling
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By bringing this complaint, the US is also trying to use the WTO
to override crucial environmental agreements, like the first
legally binding global agreement that allows countries to reject
GMOs, the Biosafety Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When EU trade ministers next meet at the WTO ministerial meeting
in Cancun in September, they need to make the US understand that
GMOs are not an issue for the WTO to regulate. Instead, action
needs to be taken to implement and strengthen the UN Protocol on
Biosafety, which will enter into force during the Cancun meeting.
The Biosafety Protocol represents a much-needed tool, especially
for developing countries wishing to ban or restrict GMO
imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urge the EU Trade Ministers to recognise that protecting the
environment and people from the hazards of GMOs is not a trade
issue but a biosafety one," said Frederica Ferrario, Greenpeace
genetic engineering campaigner in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

	The European Parliament has adopted the world's toughest rules on the labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), despite  intensified pressure from the US and the GE industry. The new rules bring great news for EU consumers, farmers and food producers - all food and animal feed containing GMOs must now be clearly labelled. (In the US and Canada all such freedom and information is currently denied.) It will also now be possible to trace products from the field to the fork.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Tougher EU GMO regulations mean consumers will know what they are eating.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules are a slap in the face for the US, which is doing
its best to forcefeed the world genetically engineered food after
heavy lobbying from biotechnology multinationals like Monsanto. The
Bush government's bully-boy tactics include waving the WTO stick -
the US is challenging the EU's policy on GMOs under the WTO's
dispute resolution process, thereby also threatening to undermine
the Biosafety Protocol. The Biosafety Protocol is the first legally
binding global agreement that allows countries to reject GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU public has been massively opposed to genetically
engineered food, since the first shipment of GE soya arrived in
Europe in 1996. And it shows no signs of decline, with European
consumers consistently rejecting GE food. Until now though, EU
labelling rules had too many loopholes to really keep GE products
out of the shopping basket, since thousands of products, such as
oil, starch, and animal feed, didn't have to be labelled. This is
about to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the new rules are certainly a huge step forward, there
are still some significant loopholes. These include the fact that
EU consumers still won't be able to tell whether meat or dairy
products come from animals fed with GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern is that EU member states will not be obliged to
act against the contamination of conventional or organic
agriculture with GMOs. They "may", rather than "shall" take action
to prevent neighbouring farms from being contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GE industry is continuing to play around with exactly how
much contamination would require labelling. They want an upwardly
creeping threshold that will undermine the reliability of the label
and keep the doors open to further invasion of GE crops in the
future. We're therefore calling for measures to prevent any genetic
contamination in seeds, with legally binding anti-contamination
measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE producers like Monsanto should also be financially liable for
potential losses that farmers suffer as a result of genetic
contamination. Seems reasonable, doesn't it? But in the US and
Canada, it's the producers who are suing the farmers! In once case,
Monsanto sued a Canadian farmer for failing to enter into an
agreement to pay royalties when pollen from a neighbouring farm
drifted and propagated on his rape (canola) field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Preventing genetic contamination should now be the number one
priority for the EU. If nothing is done to protect conventional and
organic crops from genetic contamination, the new labelling system
will actually be at risk of becoming useless after a few years
because it will be increasingly hard to secure GMO-free supplies,"
says Eric Gall, Greenpeace's EU Advisor on genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer antipathy towards GMOs remains entrenched in the EU and
will determine the market. Only recently the British Retail
Consortium (BRC), representing 90% of high-street shops in the UK,
made clear that 'supermarkets are not going to give shelf space to
something that doesn't sell.' A recent Greenpeace survey among food
companies in Germany showed that 170 out of 216 companies asked for
produce without any GE ingredients. Only 18 companies do not want
to exclude GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	Rock star Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders fame) hoisted a fifteen metre banner over the stage and invited the audience in Valencia to meet her at the Rainbow Warrior. Representatives of the local socialist party joined her on board, presenting an initiative that would require the regional government to use timber certified as sustainably harvested.  Meanwhile, activists from countries including Argentina, Mexico, France, Sweden, and the US demonstrated outside their respective Spanish embassies.  Their collective goal:  free the Rainbow Warrior, and protect the ancient forests.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior boarded  by approximately 50 agents of the Spanish Civil Guard riot police in the port of Valencia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While timber extracted from the world's last remaining forests
enters harbours in Spain and around Europe, the Rainbow Warrior is
held at bay. Authorities in Valencia detained our flagship after a
non-violent, peaceful protest against the importation of illegal
and destructive timber over ten days ago. The Spanish Government
has demanded a bond of Euro 300,000 in exchange for the ship's
freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 13th, Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the
cargo ship Honour, which transported the contentious timber.
Because of this protest the Captain of the Rainbow Warrior, Joel
Stewart, and four other activists have been ordered to pay a fine
totaling Euro 630.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish authorities have also opened a case against the
Rainbow Warrior. "Not since the French response to Greenpeace's
protests against the nuclear tests in Muroroa, has Greenpeace seen
this kind of repression," said Joel Stewart. "The Spanish
Government should be going after the real criminals who are
destroying the world's forests and not challenging the democratic
right of peaceful protest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new European Commission Action Plan on Forest Law
Enforcement Governance and Trade does not adequately reflect the
severity of the illegal logging issue and falls short on the very
important point of implementing new legislation to ban the trade in
illegally harvested timber. Spain plays an important role in
stopping the trade in illegally harvested timber and should focus
its energy and resources on implementing proper legislations to
protect the lungs of the planet and not in persecuting people with
evidence and facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of the world's last ancient forests robs local
peoples of the resources needed for their survival. We are
campaigning to protect the world's remaining ancient forests by
promoting ecologically sustainable and social responsible forest
use and the establishment of protected areas. Protected forest
areas are dedicated to the conservation of their biological
diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and
are established and managed respecting traditional land
rights--particularly those of indigenous peoples. They are
protected from road building and industrial activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Take action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help the Rainbow Warrior get back to the business of protecting
forests, and &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=825&amp;amp;s=forest_skin"&gt;tell

            Greenpeace radiation expert takes measurments outside the Al-Majidat school for girls (900 pupils) next to the  Al-Tuwaitha nuclear facility.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A convoy of vehicles bearing Greenpeace banners that read "Al
Tuwaitha - nuclear disaster - Act now!" with a single activist
walking at its head, carrying a white flag, returned a large
uranium "yellow cake" mixing canister to the US military guards
stationed at the heart of the nuclear plant. The canister - the
size of a small car - contained significant quantities of
radioactive "yellowcake" and had been dumped on a busy section of
open ground near the Tuwaitha plant. Despite the military being
aware of its presence, locals say it has been left open and
unattended for more than 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If this had happened in the UK, the US or any other country,
the villages around Tuwaitha would be swarming with radiation
experts and decontamination teams. It would have been branded a
nuclear disaster site and the people given immediate medical
check-ups. The people of Iraq deserve no less from the
international community. That they are being ignored is a scandal
that must be rectified without delay," said Mike Townsley of
Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our radiation experts have found abandoned uranium "yellowcake"
and radioactive sources scattered across the community. Much of the
material was looted from the facility by villagers who used it for
house building and water and food storage. They did not realise the
potential danger. In a week long survey, as well as the "yellow
cake" canister, Greenpeace uncovered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;radioactivity in a series of houses, including one source
measuring 10,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another source outside a 900 pupil primary school measuring
3,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;locals who are still storing radioactive barrels and lids in
their houses&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another smaller radioactive source abandoned in a nearby
field&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;consistent and repeated stories of unusual sickness after
coming into contact with material from the Tuwaitha plant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;several objects carrying radioactive symbols discarded in the
community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The preliminary survey and this morning's action in front of
heavily armed US troops highlights the total failure of the
occupying forces to address the urgent need for a full assessment,
containment and clean up of missing nuclear material from the
Tuwaitha Nuclear facility.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupying forces have so far refused to allow the UN nuclear
experts, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to carry
out proper documentation and decontamination in Iraq. The US
authorities in Baghdad have insisted upon retaining responsibility
for protecting human health but consistently deny there is a risk
to the local population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team has only been surveying for eight days and has
discovered frightening levels of radioactive contamination. The
IAEA must be allowed to return with a full mandate to monitor and
decontaminate. They may believe they have accounted for most of the
uranium, but what about the rest of the radioactive material? If
the inspectors are allowed to come out from the shadow of the
occupying forces and into the community, they can do the job
properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Latest update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team went further inside the Tuwaitha nuclear facility with
the US army to deliver the radioactive canister. They then
accompanied the army to the house in the village where we found
radiation up to 10,000 times normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US army surveyed the area and confirmed the levels. They
removed the radioactive source and took it back to the Tuwaitha
plant. The head of the radiation unit for the US army there said
that the WHO and the IAEA should get there as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the IAEA tells us that their inspectors are
due to leave today as their limited remit - to make an inventory of
the uranium at Tuwaitha - is done.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Deadly asbestos exported to Asia</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/deadly-asbestos-exported-to-as/</url><text>
	Asbestos is cleaned from buildings in Europe because of the hazards to human health. But Europe still exports asbestos to Asia in the form of old ships full of hazardous waste which are scrapped on beaches by unprotected workers. We are acting to put an end to this practice.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/6/greenpeace-activists-scale-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/6/greenpeace-activists-scale-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists scale the EU building to call for an end to the export of hazardous waste in old ships to Asia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To highlight this European double standard climbers scaled an EU
building in Brussels which has recently been cleaned of asbestos.
Our campaigner, Martin Besieux was at the scene: "We're
transforming this building to call for mandatory regulations to
oblige ship owners to clean their ships before sending them to be
scrapped in Asia. "While Europe cleans buildings like this of
asbestos to protect its own citizens, it allows European ship
owners to send the same toxic substance in their ships to Asia.
When the ships are scrapped, the asbestos pollutes the environment
and is a health risk to unprotected workers who remove it from the
vessels with their bare hands. Can Europe continue to uphold such
double standards?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the culmination of a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item%5fid=282523"&gt;
three week tour&lt;/a&gt; of Europe by a delegation of people involved in
shipbreaking in Asia, to call for an urgent solution to the
environmental and health problems associated with the industry. The
shipping sector is still reluctant to assume the full liability for
the decontamination of their ships before they are exported. This
means shipbreaking countries are being polluted with known
hazardous substances such as dioxins, asbestos and PCBs. There have
been eight accidents involving contaminated ships at the Alang yard
in India alone over the past two and a half months, in which 20
people have died. Read about &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item%5fid=282523"&gt;
the experiences on the tour and view the pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the EU to prevent pollution and protect
workers and Asian ship breaking yards by adopting mandatory
legislation to stop the shipping industry sending ships containing
hazardous materials to Asia for scrap without cleaning them
first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The shipowners and shipping federations we've met during our
European visit have refused to take any responsibility or
individual efforts to clean their ships. So we've now come to
Brussels, the heart of European politics, to call for this much
needed initiative to help stop us being polluted by European
hazardous waste. If nothing changes we will continue to be exposed
to deadly toxics for many years to come," said Mr Salim, a
shipbreaker from Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to strengthen legislation in individual shipbreaking
countries - India, Bangladesh and China - have been undermined by
ship owners because they simply send their toxic vessels to another
country that does not have such regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Act now:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	When the tiny pacific nation of Palau ratified the UN Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety last Friday, the way was cleared for the world's first legally binding agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of countries to reject imports of genetically engineered organisms (GMOs). Entering into force on 11 September 2003, the Biosafety protocol recognises that GMOs are fundamentally different from their conventional counterpart since their release pose a risk to the environment, biodiversity and human health.
&lt;div&gt;

            The protocol will help nations decide freely if they wish to allow imports of GE crops.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Bush administration is leading an aggressive campaign to
force worldwide acceptance of GMOs, and is using the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) to challenge the EU's GMO policy to intimidate
developing countries from following the cautious EU approach to
GMOs. Two-thirds of the Biosafety Protocol signatories are
developing countries, however, and with the Protocol they will soon
have a much needed tool to defend themselves against this US war on
farmers, consumers and the environment. According to the Protocol,
importing countries can reject GMOs or impose higher safety
standards on the basis of the precautionary principle.&lt;/p&gt;

	Activists have quarantined a government-run farm in Canada to expose the risks of Monsanto's genetically engineered wheat. The approval of GE wheat would not only a potential environmental disaster but will clearly be a commercial disaster for North American farmers.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists swooped on a research farm, locking the front doors of the building and sealed the site with biohazard quarantine signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of GE wheat would bring little or no benefit for farmers, while it would cause significant ecological and economical disruption. Industry's promises of increased yields, decreased pesticide use and overall economic gains haven't materialised in other GE crops, and it's unlikely that they will do for this crop. Instead, many farmers growing already commercialised Roundup Ready crops faced yield losses, increased costs from problems with herbicide resistant weeds and became increasingly dependent on toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because wheat is grown on such a vast scale globally, any adverse impacts could be enormous. Thus, the environmental release and the commercial production of GE wheat for food should be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Radioactive barrel swap</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/radioactive-barrel-swap-in-ira/</url><text>
	For many local people, the need for water storage overrides the unseen threat of radioactivity.  We took clean water containers into the communities around the Tuwaitha nuclear facility near Baghdad and encouraged people to swap them for their radioactive ones, contaminated with uranium "yellowcake".
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/6/a-resident-of-al-wadiyah-carri.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/6/a-resident-of-al-wadiyah-carri.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A resident of Al Wadiyah carries home a clean water barrel which Greenpeace activists exchanged  for radioactive ones.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a US$3 a barrel offer from the US Army, many in the
community have retained the contaminated containers. Of the 500
barrels looted from the nuclear site since the war, about 150 are
still unaccounted for. A new barrel costs US$15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The affected people are not organised criminals but the poorest
of the poor, living in chronic poverty after years of neglect and
abuse at the hands of Saddam's regime and a decade of crippling
sanctions. We hope that by offering new barrels specifically
designed for water storage that we can return the last of the
contaminated barrels to the US military for safe-keeping inside the
Tuwaitha site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small Greenpeace radiation sampling team has been working in
the community living near the Tuwaitha nuclear facility for only
two weeks and has already uncovered frightening levels of
radioactivity there, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge "yellow cake" mixing canister, with approximately 4- 5
kilos of uranium inside, abandoned on open ground near a village,
which the team returned to the US radiation experts inside Tuwaitha
plant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;radioactivity in a series of houses, including one source
measuring 10,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another source outside a 900 pupil primary school measuring
3,000 times above normal&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;locals who are still storing radioactive barrels and lids in
their houses&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;another smaller radioactive source abandoned in a nearby
field&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;several objects carrying radioactive symbols discarded in the
community&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;consistent and repeated stories of unusual sickness after
coming into contact with material from the Tuwaitha plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

None of the material found can be used for conventional nuclear
weapons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupying forces claim responsibility for public health but
have refused to allow the experts - the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) - to carry out a public health and environmental
assessment around Tuwaitha and in other parts of the country. They
insist there is no threat to public health, which is clearly not
the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence we gathered in a very short time shows that
radioactive contamination could be spread throughout the Tuwaitha
environment, affecting a large number of people. This threat must
be taken seriously and a serious investment made into assessing the
true extent of the radioactive contamination and impact on public
health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAEA should be given a full mandate to search, survey and
decontaminate towns and villages around the Tuwaitha as quickly as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24th June, Lt. Col. Melanson of the US military stationed at
the Tuwaitha nuclear site accepted our delivery of radioactive
waste and said: "I would recommend the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organisation get involved and do
an assessment. They've got involved in other instances, like in
Brazil, where sources have ended up being distributed in the
community and they actually assess the risks from that. The faster
it happens the better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuwaitha nuclear storage facility, south of Baghdad, was
left unsecured by occupying forces after the fall of Saddam Hussein
and was heavily looted. In contrast, oil pipelines and the oil
ministry were immediately secured. Just days after the cease-fire,
British Museum officials were brought in to reclaim stolen
artifacts. It was nearly two months before IAEA inspectors were
allowed to return.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Not so sweet</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/raining-chemicals/</url><text>
	To most people, it is the pure sweet refreshing act of nature that sometimes soaks you when you least expect it but always washes away the dirt and refreshes the landscape. But along with the rain comes some nasty chemicals where you would least expect to find them.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/5/rainwater-in-europe-contains-t.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainwater in Europe contains toxic chemicals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research on rainwater in the Netherlands, Belgium, and
Germany has revealed that rain water is polluted with a huge range
of toxic chemicals. This pollution is particularly worrying because
the chemicals identified include known and suspected hormone
disrupters. This means they act like the hormones that we and other
animals have in our bodies. These hazardous chemicals disrupt the
correct functioning of the body and harm reproduction and
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Unborn babies are exposed to toxic chemicals" border="0" align="left" item_id="49852"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Chemicals
in rainwater are just another ingredient of the toxic cocktail of
chemicals that surround us in our every day lives. Last month we
revealed that toxic chemicals are present in homes across Europe.
Many of these pollutants come not from traffic fumes, industrial
chimneys or pesticides but are brought into our homes as unseen and
unlabeled chemical additives in everyday consumer products.
Industry down plays the risks of these chemicals and manufacturers
claim that the chemicals remained fixed in the products and that
consumers are not exposed. But these chemicals were present in the
house dust of almost every single house of the 100 we tested in the
UK and in homes in France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Time for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are highlighting the risks of this dangerous chemical
cocktail now because there is now a unique chance to bring these
chemicals under control. Current chemical laws that should protect
us from chemical contamination are weak and ineffectual. The EU is
currently drafting new chemicals legislation that would set a world
precedent in protection from unseen and unlabeled hazardous
chemicals in our home and in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must take the first steps to end the chemicals crisis. But
the chemical industry, with support from the US administration, is
lobbying hard to delay and weaken the proposed law and to protect
their profits rather than our health. Environmental, consumer and
health organisations are demanding that the new laws phase out the
most hazardous chemicals where safer alternatives exist. This would
ensure that products in our homes are free of hidden poisons. If
the EU acts now and implements strong laws, other areas of the
world will follow. If not, a dangerous global experiment on you and
me will remain unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Genetic engineering stuck in the Dark Ages of science</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/genetic-engineering-stuck-in-d/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;50 years after the discovery of the double helix, why are genetic engineers clinging to old science?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fifty years ago, in 1953, the structure of DNA was discovered and hailed as the "secret of life". A complete understanding of living organisms seemed to be certain. However, fundamental questions regarding how DNA and genes actually work remained unanswered.  Genetic engineering (GE), at its roots, is based on an over-simplistic theory from the 1950s. Modern science has since shown gene expression to be far more complex than imagined.
&lt;div&gt;

            Still living on a flat Earth
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology and tools to insert genes from different species
in a crude, random and often forcible manner into the genomes of
organisms were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and termed "genetic
engineering". Genetic engineering was called a "life" science; it
was the technology to design and shape living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current genetic engineering industry is based on a 50 year
old understanding of molecular biology: that a gene is unaffected
by its local surroundings on the genome. The outcome of
transferring a gene from one organism to another is thought to be
specific and predictable. However, this is now regarded by most
scientists as an over-simplified theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene expression is now understood to be regulated by a complex
cellular network. Gene expression is the result of many reactions
and interactions between elements such as proteins and RNA. The
significance of these interactions is increasingly being
recognised, but remains far from being fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scientific reality is being ignored by GE companies like
Monsanto, Bayer and Syngenta. Short-term, economic interests keep
these companies holding on to an old-fashioned and outdated
scientific understanding that no longer has a sound scientific
basis. This behaviour becomes reckless when these companies release
their genetic experiments into the environment and hide it in our
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some GE crops such as soya and maize, have been commercialised
and deliberately released into the environment and food chain in
the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprising and unpredictable effects have occurred in these
crops. In one example, GE Roundup Ready soya plants unexpectedly
split their stems in high temperatures, probably because of a
higher amount of lignin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE companies regard such unexpected effects as technical
problems to be overcome by more research or adapted technologies.
However, these unforeseen effects may be due to a more fundamental
reason, that the basis of GE is invalid. Recent science has shown
that the expression of genes in the DNA of cells is not nearly as
simple and not as fully understood as the GE industry would like us
to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

	Since the US and the UK are having such a hard time finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we thought we'd lend a hand by providing this easy guide to the nukes we know about.

            February, 2003: Greenpeace 'weapons inspector' outside the U.S. embassy in Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN Weapons Inspectors and citizen weapons inspectors are welcome
to use our map to check up on just where those elusive Weapons of
Mass Destruction have been hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information about these locations has been drawn from public
sources, so we didn't have to worry about invading any countries,
incurring civilian casualties, paying costly bounties for inside
information or mess around with torture or illegal detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the best part: if the US and the UK want to dismantle
some WMDs, they don't need to go on costly excursions to foreign
countries. We found plenty in their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://dynamic.greenpeace.org/wmdmap/map-image.jpg" alt="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" title="Greenpeace map of known nuclear weapons" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can view the map by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="breadcrumbs"&gt;Requires Macromedia Flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next two weeks, the parties to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) will be meeting in Geneva. Under the
terms of that 1970 accord, the world's non-nuclear weapons states
agreed to stay that way. In exchange, the countries that fessed up
to owning nuclear weapons at the time agreed to get rid of
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope the delegates to the NPT will have a quick look at the
map to easily identify the "bad guys" who haven't been disarming as
they promised. (Clue: &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;there are a lot of little
radiation symbols&lt;/a&gt; in France, the US, China, Russia, and the
UK.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a careful review of available data, you too can confirm
the blindingly obvious: none of the NPT's Nuclear Five have done
very well in scaling back their nuclear arsenals. They've failed
utterly to eliminate them. If the nuclear powers are seriously
concerned about the WMDs of India, Pakistan, Israel, and Korea,
they ought to look to the example they set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now call us old fashioned, but we believe that a key lesson of
the Iraq crisis is that international laws and treaties to prevent
proliferation must be strengthened, not weakened. All of us who
marched against the Iraq war want to see the North Korean crisis
and future proliferation problems solved by negotiation, not
pre-emptive military strikes. "In the long run, the most effective
means to halt proliferation is the rule of law applied universally
and even-handedly to all states, not unilateral gunboat diplomacy,"
says William Peden, of Greenpeace International's disarmament
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NPT declares disarmament the international norm - 182 of its
187 members have pledged never to acquire nuclear weapons. But some
of those states, such as Brazil, are becoming increasingly
aggravated with the failure of the Nuclear Five to live up to their
part of the bargain. North Korea recently left the treaty regime
and has declared itself to be a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25814/ace.gif" border="0" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/press/release?item_id=227966&amp;amp;campaign_id="&gt;
activists dressed as missiles&lt;/a&gt; appeared at the missions of the
nuclear weapons states in Geneva as the meeting began to demand
"inspectors" symbolically dismantle the cardboard arsenals.
Greenpeace also issued a &lt;a href="/international_en/multimedia/download/1/228484/0/GREENPEACE_CARDS.pdf"&gt;
deck of cards&lt;/a&gt; with the pictures of the known nuclear "bad guys"
to provide guidance to the NPT delegates about who needed to
disarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what we want to see out of this round of the NPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Korea should abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons and
rejoin the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the use of military force to resolve
proliferation concerns, and uphold the value of multilateral legal
mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should reject the "first strike" use of nuclear weapons,
and agree legally binding security assurances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All nuclear weapon states should commit to the goal of
eliminating their illegal nuclear arsenals and halting the
development of new nuclear weapons or the "refurbishment" of
existing ones.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;States should agree an emergency mechanism to deal more swiftly
and effectively with future crises such as North Korea's withdrawal
from the NPT.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The promotion of "dual use" nuclear technology, particularly
reprocessing and enrichment technologies, which is permitted under
the NPT, should be stopped and a comprehensive ban on the
production and use of all fissile material agreed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If there are nuclear weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we hope
the right people find them. But we're not exactly sure who the
right people would be, given their mission ought to be something
the US and UK are not very good at: dismantling them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

	This is my first time sailing on the Rainbow Warrior and in fact my first time at sea. We are on a mission of peace opposing the march of the war machine to the Gulf. The highlight so far has been seeing dolphins in the surf not far from the ship. One small dolphin surfed down the crest of a wave just metres from the starboard side of the ship. The low point has been seeing my lunch in reverse.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior web editor Tracy trying out a lobster-like survival suit for an abandon ship safety drill. All this talk of abandon ship did not make the rough seas any easier.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I even came on board I had heard about tricks that have
been played on land lubbers encountering seasickness for the first
time. One story involved telling visitors that if they wore a raw
potato on a string around their necks it would ease the
seasickness. Some people believed them and did it, one man who
wasn't even sea sick yet wore his potato as a preventative
measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on this ship, and I believe with much of the same crew
that the potato gag happened. Still some people on board claim that
it works, but I'm unconvinced. When I came on board I was
determined not to fall for any silly tricks. I have a strong
stomach, I figured I was going to take it standing up, keep busy,
not give into the grumbling of my belly and tough this thing
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we left the English Channel, and as the waves grew so did
the rumbling in my gut. It's been two days, I've slept little and
the only places on board I feel comfortable are in my bunk in the
lower level accommodations or on the bridge. But I have not been
alone, to the contrary. It seems to me there is really only one
person on board who has not been in some way incapacitated by the
rough sea and he also had trouble sleeping last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget about trying to watch a movie or catch up on some work on
the computer, that is what sent me scurrying to the toilet to
re-examine my lunch. In fact the mess, where everybody eats, is
probably the worst place on the ship. It is at the back, or stern,
of the ship where the motion has the most effect on me. I can last
about long enough to eat a meal and then I have to head for the
bridge and a bit of fresh air to make sure I keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bridge is a good place to be. You can see what is going
on rather than just feel it and that does help. It is also the only
place to go for some human interaction since most other people are
also hiding out in their bunks. And it is actually a beautiful
sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waves crash over the bow creating a wall of white water and
foam. The waves crash into each other peaking in a spray of water
at eye level along side the ship. It's somewhat hypnotic. Sitting
at the back of the bridge on a high bench, as the ship rolls and
pitches at one moment all I can see through the bridge windows is
sea, the next minute all I see is sky. It would be fantastic if not
for the queasy feeling in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was particularly bad, even by the other crew's
standards. I went to bed early hoping I could sleep but was woken
around midnight as I was being flung around my bunk, while other
things were being flung around my room. I got up several times as I
heard crashes and bangs and investigated what was moving then tried
to secure everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn't so successful at securing myself in my bunk. I tried to
sleep, and I did find one position that prevented me from being
thrown about, but it wasn't so comfortable: one knee at a 90 degree
angle with my knee against the side board, my back against the wall
and my leg stretched out with my foot braced against the wall at
the end of my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't even say that the rolling about was as bad as the
noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am used to the noise in my apartment which I wouldn't say is
quiet, but they are familiar and consistent noises. But on the ship
last night there were unpredictable, loud bumps and bangs
throughout the night. The crashing of the waves are the obvious
ones, but then what was that dull thud, and what about that hollow
thump. I couldn't even hear the regular drone of the engines or
generator underneath the noise of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 3:30am I gave up, I headed for higher ground. I wasn't
the only one who couldn't sleep, several crew had just been up
tying things down, cleaning up messes created by the violent
rolling. Some plants flew right out of their pots. How do you lash
down soil?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a few more things that needed cleaning up and securing,
grabbed myself some toast (still hungry since I never had the
chance to digest lunch) and headed for the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge is quite a different scene at night, all dark except
for the lights of the radar and navigation instruments. All I could
see of the storm around us was the white crest of the waves as they
fell on top of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few of us on the bridge shared tricks for sleeping in such
bad weather. Most people were putting their mattresses on the floor
perpendicular to their bunks since the rolling of the ship was the
problem. Serkan and Colin, the two tallest guys on board slept on
the tiny benches in their cabins. But it was Erik's suggestion that
got me a few hours of sleep last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting some clothes underneath one side of my mattress, the
bed was on an angle and I was held up against the wall of my bunk
without the strange contortions and I managed to get to sleep
eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation wasn't much better this morning, but the wind has
changed and being out on deck helping to raise the sails has
improved my mood and the butterflies in my stomach. I overheard
someone say this is going to last for a few days - oh please no! I
hope that we find a ship with supplies for the war soon, and I hope
it is in a quiet, calm harbour so we can stop them with the
determination in our hearts, not the forward motion of our
stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't have to go to sea to help stop the war, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=505&amp;amp;s=blue2s"&gt;you can
take action showing your opposition to the war by writing to
members of the UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and ask them to say no to
war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Parker was in charge of Dow Chemical. While not exactly corporate environmental enemy numero uno (that dubious honour goes to Lee Raymond, head of ExxonMobil) he consistently refused to consider helping survivors of the 1984 Union Carbide Gas disaster in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intrepid activists from the international campaign for justice in Bhopal had one goal in mind - to ensure Parker was not able to forget that Dow is now responsible for the ongoing suffering of thousands in Bhopal and a using only a fraction of Dow's huge annual turnover he could end the ongoing tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;23 October: Houston, Texas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker was out at a prime greenwashing opportunity at the Tenth Annual Houston Conservation Leadership Awards luncheon (a front group funded by dirty industry). Dow was sponsoring the awards to the tune of US$40,000 to brush up its image. While Parker espoused the wonderful contribution Dow makes to the environment our courageous activists were plotting to enliven proceedings beyond the mundane corporate backslapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech Parker was interrupted by a photographer who announced "We have someone here from Bhopal with a better award for you," she told him in front of 500 bemused guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booing from the Dow contingent at tables near the stage fell silent when Bhopali activist Kinnu appeared in her sari bearing two genuine Bhopali brooms. A flustered Parker was unsure what to do now his careful prepared speech was interrupted by some harsh reality. Kinnu told Parker that he was a liar to say that Dow had no liabilities in Bhopal. She told him that women living near the abandoned factory have mercury and other toxins in their breast milk and demanded that Dow take immediate action to clean up its mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker flapped for a moment, and then began repeating his old formula about remembering where he was in 1984 when he heard the news about Bhopal. Any activist who has written to Dow about Bhopal will be able to quote it word for word. During the commotion at the front, the 500 guests were being leafleted on why Dow should clean up Bhopal and some friendly words of advice - Investing a bit of capital in taking care of the Bhopal disaster would be so much better than this useless PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let hope at least a few guests left with a more realistic idea of Dow's contribution the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;15 November: University of Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Parker was gracing the University with a visit but just to make sure he doesn't forget, we were there to remind him of a few harsh truths. After his usual speech about morality, sustainability and how Dow is just the best damn company to work for in the world there was a gentle Q&amp;amp;A session lined up. Mr Parker got a preliminary question from the back about Bhopal. He gave the usual "I feel your pain, it was awful, I remember where I was when Bhopal happened, oh, but we have no liabilities thank you very much". However our student organiser, Azita, wasn't buying it, but Parker bought her sweet cherub smile and called on her next, expecting a soft question. Here is roughly how it played out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "Mr Parker, the liabilities in Bhopal can't be 'over' when people are still being poisoned every day?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I, uh, meant that our liabilities are over."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "Call me foolish, but I didn't think that corporations, could just determine when and if their liabilities are over. That's why we have courts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Um, yeah..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And you forgot to mention that your company is being sued in the Federal District Court of New York for contamination at the Bhopal site."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, we're actually trying to find a solution to this - we are currently in negotiations with Bhopal survivors -"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "No you're not. You see, I'm with Greenpeace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; (internal groan, face contorts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And we've been trying to ask you for almost a year to sit down with Bhopal survivor organisations and talk about the problems in Bhopal. And we've sent you over 50,000 postcards, emails and faxes to remind you to do this!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I....."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Azita:&lt;/span&gt; "And that's why I want to present you with this book (Dominique Lapierre's Five Past Midnight in Bhopal)so you can read how the people of Bhopal suffer while you drag your feet in dealing with your liabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Parker:&lt;/span&gt; (Begrudgingly takes the book. Gives Azita the look of death)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Facilitator:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, that's all the time we have today for questions for Mr. Parker. Thank you all for coming."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow contingent left the campus in a huff after their recruitment party was ambushed but not before they each got handed a copy of the technical guidelines to clean up the Bhopal site. Some nice bedtime reading maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we were not going to let Mr Parker get off lightly. After having being quoted as saying he will "be spending a few quiet moments of reflection" on the 18th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster. We decided to drop by to see if the quiet reflection lead to a change of heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;3 December 2002: Midland, Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 students from the University of Michigan along with environmental and social justice activists from around the state visited Michael Parker's house where they held a vigil to mark the 18th anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster. Rather than some quiet moments of reflection it appeared Parker was hosting a party instead. The activists were there to remind Mr Parker that they hold him personally responsible for the ongoing suffering in Bhopal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the vigil candles, Bhopal banners, tombstones, Parker "Wanted Posters" and other props didn't seem to distract the gleeful party goers, Michael Parker did step outside and debate the activists for approximately twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the now very familiar meaningless Bhopal waffle there were a few statements of interest from Mr Parker. He claimed he was "too busy" to see the suffering for himself in Bhopal. Pressed on the fact that the treatment of the victims is made harder by the composition of the gases leaked in the disaster being kept as trade secrets he claimed he know nothing of this and would ensure this information was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;10 December 2002: Midland, Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of announcing he intends to release trade secrets Mr Parker got canned by Dow. This firing was supposedly, 'solely in light of the disappointing financial performance of the company' and of course absolutely nothing to do with the growing criticism of Dow's stance on Bhopal. Some on the &lt;a href="http://dowethics.com/r/about/corp/newleader.htm"&gt;internet put a different spin&lt;/a&gt; on events...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Dow has a new CEO - William S. Stavropoulos. A change is good, it allows for a change or heart. William should know all about Bhopal as he masterminded the merger with Union Carbide. However since taking over he has been very silent on the issue of Bhopal. He seems mostly concerned with Dow's falling stock price. So we will definately be paying him a visit or two to demonstrate that resloving the issue of Bhopal would give him lots more time to concentrate on counting the corporate pennies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more unconventional interventions whenever William puts in a public apperance....&lt;/p&gt;

	Dubbed the Nobel Prize for the Environment, the Goldman Environmental Prize is being awarded to Von Hernandez, Greenpeace's Toxic's campaigner from the Philippines.  Von has fought for years to stop the spread of incinerators and other polluting practices to developing countries and now he is the first Filipino to win the Goldman prize. Von wins the award for his role in achieving historic legislation in the Philippines that bans waste incineration nationwide.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Von Hernandez, 2003 Goldman Environmental Prize Winner, Asia (Philippines).
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a generous smile and smooth singing voice, Von Hernandez
can immediately make you feel comfortable and inspired. He is as at
home lobbying governments in the Philippines and around the world
as he is in his home town organising community action against
polluting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of Asia's leading activists against waste incineration,
Von helped make history in 1999 when the Philippines became the
first country in the world to ban waste incineration nationwide.
Today, Von is on the forefront of a heated battle to hold the ban
in the face of government corruption and industry pressure. His
work has been held up as a model for waste incineration activists
throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von grew up in Manila and became active in the incineration
issue when he began working for Greenpeace as a toxics campaigner
for Southeast Asia. "At that time, my campaigning focused almost
exclusively on the dumping of hazardous wastes from the
industrialised world to developing countries. It did not take long
for me to realise that it wasn't just hazardous waste that was
being dumped in Asia, but also toxic technologies and products,"
says Von.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waste disposal is a municipal nightmare in the Philippines.
Every day Metro Manila produces 6000 tonnes of garbage, much of
which ends up in Hernandez's current hometown of Quezon City.
Quezon City is home to Payatas, the region's biggest dump and the
focus of international headlines in 2000 when a rain storm caused
the dump's mountain of garbage to collapse, killing at least 300
people and destroying more than 500 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With waste incineration being touted as the solution to Manila's
waste problems, Von and his allies jumped into action. They
informed local communities that waste incinerators are the largest
source of hormone-disrupting dioxins, one of the most toxic
chemicals known to science. The incineration process produces ash
with concentrated amounts of heavy metals, such as lead, arsenic
and cadmium that, when buried, pollute groundwater for generations.
These chemicals have been linked to birth defects, cancer,
respiratory ailments and reproductive dysfunction among people who
live near incineration plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report found dioxins in the breast milk of Filipino
women who live near and work in the Payatas dumpsite to be
extremely high - many times higher than the health limit set by the
World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Like hazardous wastes, dirty technologies like incinerators
tend to follow the path of least resistance," says Von. "Typical of
the attitude of irresponsible multinational companies, the
incineration industry will always find advantages in operating in
less regulated environments. Aware that environmental monitoring
and enforcement capacity is severely lacking in the global south,
with a little bit of public relations - obsolete incinerators can
easily be packaged as modern, non-polluting technologies for
handling waste - and this is exactly the trend we are seeing in
many Asian countries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Convenor of the Philippine Clean Air Coalition and
coordinator of Greenpeace International's Toxics Campaign in Asia,
Von helped turn the incineration controversy in the Philippines
into a national electoral issue in 1998. He helped organise mass
protests, testified in hearings, and waged a national public
education campaign in the media to draw attention to the
devastating health impacts of waste incineration and to highlight
proven alternatives to burning waste. Hernandez was instrumental in
securing widespread support for the campaign, including the support
of the Catholic Church, which commands enormous respect and
authority in a country where Catholicism is the dominant faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of campaigning Von faced strong industry pressure
and harassment. He has been threatened with libel suits, ridiculed
in the press by industry sympathisers, and blamed for the Manila
garbage crisis. Public officials who wanted to lift the
incineration ban even publicly threatened to dump garbage on Von's
doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his perseverance paid off when the incineration ban was
approved in the Clean Air Act of 1999. The ban is scheduled to take
full effect this year, but powerful members of Congress and local
government officials, some of whom have documented ties with the
waste management industry, are working furiously to have the ban
repealed so that proposals to install mega-incinerators and
landfills can move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I see the migration of incinerators in the Asian region as part
of the continuing translocation of the destructive Western
industrial development model, whose key hallmark is
over-consumption. As such, I see our victory against incineration
not only as a triumph against polluting technologies, but more
importantly as a key opportunity for developing countries like the
Philippines to break away from the traditional development paradigm
and chart a different course for managing its resources in a
sustainable way. In other words, this is an opportunity for
countries like the Philippines to avoid repeating the mistakes of
the West."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last year the people's clean air movement was dealt a blow
when the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in favour of Jancom
Environmental Corporation, a waste management consortium, and its
plans to build a mega-landfill and a huge waste incinerator to
service Metro Manila. While President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
ultimately used her authority to reject the contract, the legal
door has been opened, making the ban more vulnerable to attack.
Meanwhile, international financial institutions like the Asian
Development bank, the World Bank and the Japanese Bank for
International Cooperation continue to promote incineration projects
in the Philippines and throughout the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Von is leading the charge to promote cleaner
alternatives to waste incineration, including segregating garbage
at its source, composting and recycling - methods that have been
proven to create jobs and revenue for municipalities while
protecting public health. Following the success of the campaign to
ban incineration, Von moved swiftly to create the Eco Waste
Coalition to urge the Philippine government to adopt legislation
that would manage and allocate resources to more sustainable
methods of waste disposal. The Ecological Solid Waste Management
Act was adopted in January 2001. Von is now working with the
coalition to push for full implementation of the incinerator ban
and the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von is also global activist and his passion for the planet
reaches beyond his country. He was a rousing presence at the recent
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg where,
together with local allies and the Global Alliance for Incinerator
Alternatives, he held a "zero waste" forum that drew more than 100
environmental leaders from 20 nations. That same year, he was
instrumental in organising the first "Global Day of Action Against
Waste Incineration" which involved more than 125 organisations from
54 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our fight against incineration, landfills and polluting
technologies is actually a struggle against the negative and
destructive forces of over-consumption and dirty industrial
development," says Von. "It is essentially a struggle to shift the
dominant paradigm to one which is truly respectful of life and the
rights of future generations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in San Francisco to receive his award with the other
winners, Von was congratulated by the founder of the Goldman
Environmental Prize. This year's winners have looked beyond
themselves, often risking freedom or safety, to inspire their
communities to fight for environmental protection, said Richard N.
Goldman. We are honoured to recognise work that exemplifies how
much can be accomplished when ordinary people take extraordinary
action to protect the health of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Each year six grassroots individuals from six regions of the world are recognised as environmental heroes.

	We don't know if John Brady Kiesling is a member of Greenpeace, but we'd be proud of his company on any of our ships.  He's clearly earned his stripes at standing up against the powers that be.
&lt;div&gt;

            An Argentine anti-war activist wearing a Bush mask highlights the role of big oil companies such as Exxon/Esso in the impending war.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiesling is the career diplomat who resigned from the US Foreign
Service last week over plans to invade Iraq. We believe he has
taken a courageous and principled action which deserves worldwide
attention and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said his conscience would no longer allow him to represent
the Bush Administration in policies that are "incompatible not only
with American values but also with American interests," and goes on
to express a deep belief in America's potential as a force for good
in the world, and his deep disappointment in how it is "straining
beyond its limits an international system we built with such toil
and treasure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His central question to a president he says he can no longer
follow is "Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in
Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied Territories, to our
own advice, that overwhelming military power is not the answer to
terrorism?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0227-13.htm" target="_blank"&gt;full text of his letter of resignation&lt;/a&gt; to Colin
Powell was published in the New York Times on February 27th, and
has done the wildfire thing on the internet, rocketing up the ranks
at &lt;a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/track.asp?id=4503813" target="_blank"&gt;Blogdex&lt;/a&gt;, an outstanding barometer of what's
being talked about on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His letter is a stirring and articulate act of moral bravery,
and while it says nothing different than millions of people said
when they marched on February 15th, it does so with a different
authority. It comes from the ranks of those politicians who are
expected, like soldiers, to toe the line and salute the flag
without question. Kiesling broke ranks -the way few in history have
done, and the way many more should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The courage of saying "No" to war&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look back at the few examples of insiders who said no to
unjust wars, or to tyrants such as Hitler or Pol Pot or Saddam, we
always ask, with the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of the
waste of human life and resulting tragedies, 'Why did so many
follow? Why did more people not stand up and say no?'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope many people read this letter. We hope other American
diplomats read this letter and follow its lead either in stepping
up the pressure on the administration from within, or following
Kiesling's example and stepping down. We are encouraging newspapers
worldwide to reprint it, and for all who oppose this war to applaud
it. You can help by &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1046519318/index_html" target="_blank"&gt;taking action now&lt;/a&gt; to ensure Mr. Kiesling's
letter is widely read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Beware the oil barrons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the diplomat says that "The result, and perhaps the motive,
[of pursuing Iraq] is to justify a vast misallocation of shrinking
public wealth to the military and to weaken the safeguards that
protect American citizens from the heavy hand of government," he
echoes the famous, and still valid, warning of US President
Eisenhower to "beware the military industrial complex."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Kiesling leaves unsaid is that, in this day and age, the
most powerful player in that "complex" is big oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former diplomat makes a clear and compelling case for why we
should be worried about the political leadership of the United
States. But writing this off as the obsessions of an "ideological
and self-serving" president misses an important part of the
picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saddam Hussein would just be another run-of-the-mill tyrant,
probably unworthy of US attention, were it not for the vast oil
wealth he commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a darker force at work on US policy as well -- and it's
as dark as a barrel of Exxon crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help battle that force by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;joining the campaign
to stop Esso/Exxon&lt;/a&gt; from fuelling war by fuelling the world's

	After a long and intense struggle by environmentalists world-wide, the British Columbia government agreed to protect 20 of the Great Bear Rainforest's most ecologically important valleys from all industrial activity. Another 68 valleys were placed under a moratorium until informed decisions could be made how to best manage the forest. It was an unprecedented move by a government and a heart-warming victory for all involved. But two years later few of the promises have made it off paper and into the forest.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's report card time and members of the British Columbia government will not be taking this one home to the family.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the world praised British Columbia for forging a
great consensus - the Great Bear Rainforest Agreement. In April
2001, the long and intense battle over the fate of BC's Great Bear
Rainforest, the largest area of intact temperate rainforest left on
Earth, resulted in what many viewed as a great first step and a win
for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BC government, First Nations, rural communities, forestry
companies and people concerned about conserving ancient forests for
posterity all walked away in agreement. A comprehensive solution
unlike anything the world has seen could happen in British
Columbia, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of the agreement was a commitment to a new way
of logging on the coast, one that valued the coast's unparalleled
ecological diversity, and abandoned relentless and indiscriminate
clearcut logging. And many of the most crucial areas of
biodiversity were set aside for future protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, environmentalists suspended an international markets
campaign that resulted in high-profile customers like Home Depot
and IKEA agreeing to stop buying forest products from the Great
Bear Rainforest if clearcut logging continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, what has the British Columbia government done to
ensure this unprecedented "peace in the woods" remains intact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with other groups ForestEthics, Rainforest Action Network
and the Sierra Club of Canada all involved in forging the agreement
and working toward long-term solutions for the region, we have
evaluated the government's progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictory direction and a lack of open communication from
the government are raising concerns about the fate of the Great
Bear Rainforest. Cases of inconsistent government timelines and
breaches of process are numerous. It appears that internal strife
within the government itself is holding back progress.
Opportunities for lasting solutions could be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the province may be upholding, for now, the letter of
the agreement, the constant delays and frequent attempts to
undermine the process and their boosterism of unsustainable
development belies any real commitment to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, BC's market reputation is at stake. A lack of
strong direction and clear communication from the government
regarding their commitment to a conservation solution for the Great
Bear Rainforest creates a climate of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a new survey by IBM Business Consulting of buyers who
annually purchase more than $2 billion worth of BC wood found that
"there is clear evidence of a greenward shift in the market for
forest products, including those from BC. The shift is real, buyers
believe it will continue, and it will have a negative impact on
forest regions and producers that do not respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But extensive analysis by the David Suzuki Foundation, Global
Forest Watch and the Raincoast Conservation Society shows that on
the ground logging companies have not changed their practices,
despite commitments on paper to "conservation" and
"sustainability".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the agreement was signed, 72 percent of the logging was
done through clearcutting. In other areas the trees left standing
in logging sites are too few to sustain old-growth dependent
species and these meagre patches of forest cannot be described as
old-growth "habitat".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements to practices are virtually non-existent and
destructive clearcutting of the Great Bear Rainforest continues
outside of the agreed moratoria areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, British Columbia has the opportunity to lead the
world and create lasting conservation solutions, as well as capture
new market share for environmentally responsible products. Will the
coming months be a time of unprecedented progress or increasing
uncertainty for BC's coast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The Report Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Protection: D-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after the historic "peace in the woods" agreement,
none of the valleys have been permanently protected. In May 2002,
the BC government placed the valleys in "interim" protection.
However, this expires in less than three months, then the valleys
will have no protection from development and logging could resume
anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Credible Science: C+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong team of biologists and ecologists has been pulled
together, and good work is being done on the ecosystem-based forest
management. But the work of this team remains underfunded and
behind schedule. The delays are due to government's sluggish
delivery of critical scientific data and analysis, largely because
of ill-advised reductions in technical capacity. It is unlikely
there will be enough time to understand or adequately incorporate
the team's work in to the final decisions for the Great Bear
Rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Forest Policy: D-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the BC government announced a package of
forestry reforms to agreements that have governed the relationship
between communities and logging companies for more than half a
century. While communities saw their longstanding benefits from
this contract simply eliminated with little in return, the logging
companies' benefits were greatly increased and further
entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These momentous changes have been drafted with the forest
industry behind closed doors and with no community consultation.
The government's policy changes will increase corporate powers by
allowing forest tenures to be subdivided and sold, while companies
are released from their obligations to run local mills and sustain
local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Ecological Management and Planning: F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Central Coast the government has been sluggish
providing essential data and analysis to the scientists who, in
turn, has been unable to meet the timetable for delivery of
information. Instead of delaying discussion until they have
credible information to use, the government is forcing the planning
table to go over old ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the North Coast several issues are causing profound concerns
among environmentalists including the tight timelines for the
planning process, limited capacity for First Nations to engage
effectively in this process, the government's continued approval of
raw log exports from the area and the proposed rapid expansion of
aquaculture on the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the government temporarily reduced the rate of logging
by removing 1.5 million hecatres from the Annual Allowable Cut, but
this decision also expires the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Managing Change: B-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there have been some positive steps, BC's government has
slashed existing community economic development programmes on the
coast and the infrastructure for assisting economic diversification
has not been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While little has been done in coastal communities, there are
various initiatives taking place, including development of
potential investment models to help fund economic transition for
communities that want to undertake conservation-based planning. To
date, these talks, while they are promising, have been slow. A
committee is working on this project and the government and others
have committed funds to develop new models and securing
conservation investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;First Nations Rights and Title: D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government-to-government protocol, signed by eight coastal
First Nations and the province, establishes mechanisms for land-use
planning and commits the two parties to both a framework for
environmentally responsible development and implementing agreements
that would provide economic opportunities for First Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The province and First Nations agreed to develop a range of
economic strategies for forestry, tourism and fisheries guided by
principles of ecologically responsible management. In the past year
progress has been made to plan activities, but First Nations still
have not had any direct benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the province's changes to forestry regulations will
further infringe on First Nations' rights through the weakening of
provincial oversight mechanisms, without which it is questionable
whether the government can fulfill its fiduciary obligations to
BC's indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the government's commitment to massive expansion of the
aquaculture industry has proven to be an enormously contentious
issue in First Nation communities. While one or two First Nations
are receptive to, or engaged in, fin-fish aquaculture, the huge
majority are adamantly opposed to the siting of this high-risk
industry in their traditional territories.&lt;/p&gt;

	A decision by a French court to lift an injunction against the use of a parody logo on the StopEsso website was an important victory for free speech on the internet, a victory for the climate, and evidence that Esso's strategy to silence critics using the courts is futile.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Esso is sabotaging climate protection in order to continue its
dirty business and has attempted to use the courts to silence its
critics. Today that strategy failed," said Greenpeace's Stephanie
Tunmore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso France began legal action against Greenpeace in July 2000
over the StopEsso website, which uses a logo featuring a double
dollar sign ($$) in place of the double "S" in the oil giant's red
and blue logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, a French judge upheld Esso's bid to get the
logo taken off the Greenpeace France website. But after hearing
Greenpeace's appeal, Justice Lacabarats in Paris found that
StopEsso's use of the logo was allowable under the right to free
speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is Esso's own behaviour interfering in international action
on climate change that is damaging its reputation," said
Tunmore.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jo comes from London and cooks for the 20 people on board the Rainbow Warrior everyday. She makes us mouth watering dishes that keep everyone working hard on deck and in the engine room and contented at rest. How does she do it?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/2/jo-the-cook-onboard-the-rainb.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/2/jo-the-cook-onboard-the-rainb.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Jo, the cook onboard the Rainbow Warrior, enjoys a little sunshine in between cooking energy packed meals for the crew.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we spend our days keeping the ship in top shape and
running smoothly in between trying to stop the march of the war
machine, one of the things that keeps us going is Jo's amazing
cooking. If it weren't for all the work on deck, we would be
packing on the pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to fend for ourselves for breakfast, but by lunch we sit
down to a variety of dishes for meat eaters and vegetarians. We
line up in the mess, heap our plates full, sit down and for the
first few minutes everyone is silent. Then with our bellies full
the joking and laughing takes over before heading back to work for
the afternoon. The happy ritual is repeated again for supper
followed by some struggle for chocolate where the captain sometimes
uses his clout to take first pick of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does our adored cook Jo manage to feed all the crew and
guests on board the Rainbow Warrior and keep everyone happy and
hard working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tells it best herself. &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/no_war/crew/joe1.mp3"&gt;Listen to
her answer as she cooks lunch for the crew before the anti-war
action in Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt; (mp3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/no_war/crew/joe2.mp3"&gt;Listen to
Joe's explanation of how she got started cooking on a Greenpeace
ship and why she loves to do it&lt;/a&gt; (mp3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a quick way to cook for 20 peace activists and keep
them protesting? Try Jo's recipe for Creamy Mushroom Soup which
warmed the crew up after a cold night in Antwerp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coarsely chop two kilograms of mushrooms and sauté in a large
pot with a cup of butter. Mix in 100ml of flour. Then add five
litres of vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Add salt and nutmeg
and let the broth simmer for five minutes. Then add 625ml of heavy
cream. If activists are really cold, add 250ml of dry sherry. Then
take a hand blander to the mixture and puree into a fine liquid so
activists don't have to waste any energy chewing. Serve hot and
watch them smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceaction.org.uk/war/activists.htm"&gt;Meet
more of the crew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As we sailed into the Mediterranean Sea a few weeks ago, the first thing that struck me was all the garbage floating around the ship.  We were starting to identify the often sighted bottle-fish and plastic bag-turtles between beautiful pilot whales and dolphins. It's really not funny at all. It's the sad story of the Mediterranean.

            Amanda, Greenpeace cook for the MV Esperanza.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that after seeing so much waste in the sea there
would not be too much left elsewhere, but there is. Many of the
countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea have no working system
for recycling and reducing the waste they produce. So they burn
it!! This is creating even more problems with dangerous
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our ships we have very careful waste management and we live
by the words: reduce, reuse, recycle. Beautiful words and a
necessity for clean living not only on this ship but also on the
planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are presently in Tarragona in Spain, about a one-hour train
ride from Barcelona. We are here to create awareness, to spread
information about how toxics get released into nature, and
hopefully to inspire people to act against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a number of open-ship days, and Sunday at one point
as I looked out from the ship there was a loooong line of people
waiting to come and see our ship and hear about our work.
Brilliant!! There are some wonderful, hardworking Spanish
volunteers here to help us show people around and to tell them
about the ship and our work. Usually this is something I love to do
myself but my Spanish is more or less limited to "Ya soy la
cusinera" (I am the cook) and I'm afraid I won't inspire anyone
with those words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday (October 22) was a different kind of day; Greenpeace
made a non-violent direct action (as we often do) at the Constantí
incinerator in Tarragona, Spain. Thirty-three activists blocked the
gates. This place is a good example of a bad thing: these monstrous
burners should not be allowed. The air is filled with a strong
toxic smell, there is even a sign that warns of radioactive
waste(!!) and everything but the kitchen sink is getting
burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toxin-filled smoke is released into the air and the ashes
into the soil. The toxins now have an easy way to reach the ground
waters as well and - voila! -- they have managed to pollute every
element of the nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is in these emissions, one might ask? Well some
substances identified in smoke and waste from incinerators are
heavy metals, PCBs and dioxin, just to give a brief picture. And it
is not a pretty picture. These toxic substances are going straight
into the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can the politicians here live with this system? Some people
even promote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;incinerators as a green option to solve the growing waste
problem created by modern living. But you do not get rid of it. You
create an even bigger problem and greater health problems. All when
the solution quite easy. We need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Reduce Reuse Recycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ship we have our trash cleaned out, compressed and
sorted, but our garbage space is getting full and we need to get
rid of some of it so we asked a police officer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who was passing by the ship, if he knew of a way we could
responsibly dispose of it. He answered: there's an incinerator just
a bit away from here. Well, I don't think so!!!&lt;/p&gt;

	"Yea I hope you sail that [expletive deleted] Rainbow warrior up to a US warship, and I hope they blow you to kingdom come, Have a nice Day."

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I've been a Greenpeace supporter in
the past, but after seeing your ships trying to block [military
ships]... I will never send another dime to Greenpeace, which
really is a pity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I'm not surprised to see that your
international office is HQ'd in Germany! A perfect place for
sissies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For the record, Greenpeace International is headquartered in
Amsterdam, which is in the Netherlands.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're averaging around 300 emails a day here at Greenpeace
International headquarters about our stance against this war. Much
of it is unprintable hate-mail. Some of it expresses surprise and
confusion about why we're taking an anti-war position. Some of it
comes with membership cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Karen and Ludmilla in our Supporter Services Department, who
field and respond to this daily barrage, it can be pretty
depressing. Especially when they get asked what they know about
war. Karen grew up in Northern Ireland, surviving the worst of the
troubles. Ludmilla grew up in Czechoslovakia and witnessed the
Velvet Revolution. Their personal experiences of a totalitarian
regime and bloodshed were part of what led them to Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news isn't all bad. In some of our offices there's been an
oupouring of support for our stance against the war. And while the
mail is 90 percent negative, every now and then, a little spark of
encouragement comes along that they can forward out to our folks in
the field - the people on our ships who have been braving military
security, freezing temperatures, arrest and harassment to stand up
for what they believe in. Here's two examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"I want to congratulate you for the
action in Rotterdam concerning that ship with weapons for the next
Gulf War... I am really proud of belonging to and supporting such
an organization as Greenpeace. Keep fighting and try to show the
world that the US themselves do not fulfil many of the conditions
they try to impose on Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"As an American opposed to the
planned murder of many thousands of Iraqis at the hands of our
government, I salute and congratulate Greenpeace on the blocking of
the Military Port in Iraq protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;I've long been a Greenpeace
supporter, and remember the active part Greenpeace played in
demonstrations in [Washington] DC against the first Iraq war, and
heard that afterwards that the organization took a real hit in the
form of less people giving money or joining Greenpeace-- So all
that much better that Greenpeace is taking a principled stand on
Iraq and getting out and DOING something about it-- You are setting
a terrific example for the rest of us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message above bore a subject line of "Donation and why."
It's the kind of support that keeps us going, both emotionally and
financially. We rely on individual donations from nearly 3 million
people world-wide who give knowing we're going to do the right
thing, even when it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Have you donated lately? If you believe we're doing the right
thing in opposing this war, the best way to let us know is by &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/war/"&gt;joining us&lt;/a&gt;. Still not
sure? Read on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;But what about Saddam?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't support Saddam Hussein. We don't back any governments
or political leaders. When we decided to take a stand against this
war, it was because we see a far greater danger in the concept of
preventive war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has always been characterised by taking action
against global threats. We hope this is why most of our supporters
signed on in the first place. Regardless of whether this war is
prevented or not, and if not, regardless of who wins and how long
it takes, we honestly believe -no spin, but really in our hearts
believe - that it is wrong, and that in the long term the world
will be a much worse place in which to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one nation to take arms against another because it
&lt;i&gt;believes&lt;/i&gt; that nation to be a threat undermines the
foundations of peaceful coexistence, multilateral institutions like
the United Nations, and an "entire web of laws, treaties,
organisations, and shared values," to quote &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0227-13.htm"&gt;John Brady
Kiesling's letter of resignation&lt;/a&gt; from the US diplomatic
core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it may be to those who view Saddam as a cipher of
evil to step in and remove him militarily, one has to ask what's
next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the US conducts a preventive war on Iraq, will it set its
sights on Iran? North Korea? And if the US can wage a preventive
war to protect its national security, shouldn't India or Pakistan
have the same right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step on a slippery slope. It ends with the
United Nations in tatters and the rule of might making right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What does Greenpeace have to do with war?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a reason that Greenpeace has the word 'peace' in its
name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were founded on a disarmament issue, when a boatful of
hippies sailed to stop a nuclear weapons test in Amchitka, in the
Aleutian Islands off Alaska, in 1972. In the decades following we
sailed, walked, and flew against nuclear weapons testing in all the
Nuclear Weapons States, ran campaigns against missiles and
landmines, and stood up against war and its consequences in the
Persian Gulf and Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've not been present or outspoken against all wars, just as
we've not been present or outspoken against all crimes against the
environment. But from our earliest days, Greenpeace has been about
preserving the future of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four issues directly inform our campaign against this war:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3940"&gt;End
the nuclear threat&lt;/a&gt;: We support the elimination of weapons of
mass destruction. That means the US and other nuclear weapons
states living up to their commitments to disarm -- not just the
states that they oppose. Maintaining a world of nuclear "haves"
which take military action against "have nots" is not the way to
end the nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3937"&gt;Stop
climate change&lt;/a&gt;: This conflict is becoming a war because our
world is dependent on oil. The right path is to secure energy
independence for the US and all nations through renewables -- not
to secure more and more sources of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3941"&gt;Eliminate
toxics:&lt;/a&gt; War is the ultimate toxic cocktail. If we see the kind
of oil spills and fires that we saw in the last gulf war, along
with the chemical contamination of a conventional war, the region
will suffer another major environmental catastrophe. That's not
even to speak of the possibility of either side using chemical or
biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/campaigns/intro?campaign_id=3943"&gt;Ensure
corporate responsibility:&lt;/a&gt; This war is brought to you by the oil
companies. In particular, Exxon has been driving US dependency on
oil by actively opposing the Kyoto protocol and denying climate
change to be a reality. If the US were on a path to renewable
energy, it wouldn't need to go to war to secure its oil supplies.
As we've said elsewhere, Saddam would be just another
run-of-the-mill tyrant among many in the world today were it not
for the fact that he may sit on up to a quarter of the world's oil
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposing war with Iraq is not a departure from Greenpeace's
agenda -- it's part of a continued opposition to policies and
actions that threaten our world's future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Conscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days of the cold war, our disarmament policies led to
accusations from both sides: in the West that we were funded by the
KGB, in the East that we were funded by the CIA. There was a time
when our policies against nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific
almost forced us to shut the doors of our Paris office for lack of
national support. And our actions against whaling have always
crippled support for Greenpeace in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters to us is not that we're popular, but that we're
following our conscience, and that enough people of conscience
agree with us to keep us going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you support that principle, and you support our view that
this war is wrong, please &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/war/"&gt;support Greenpeace.&lt;/a&gt;
Karen and Ludmilla could use some new pen-pals.&lt;/p&gt;

	As United States policy turns from deterrence to dominance, John Passacantando, director of Greenpeace in the US, is asking George W. Bush some hard questions. But the toughest question for Bush is how will he explain a war on the Iraqi people and a growing world hatred of the US to his own children?

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Dear President Bush:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently your administration released a report entitled "The
National Security Strategy of the United States of America," which
proposes shifting the strategic priorities of the United States
from deterrence to dominance. As a result, many of us are
struggling to understand what this strategy might mean for our
country, our soldiers, our jobs and our safety at home and
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trying to understand why you are pushing for a war with
Iraq. We are trying to understand how to raise our families if the
American values of compassion, humility and understanding are to be
displaced by domination, arrogance and stubborn holding forth of
American needs and way of life first and foremost, despite the
consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you, I have two daughters. At some point in our lives you
and I both will be held accountable to them regarding how we have
fulfilled our roles as parents as well as how we have engaged and
changed the world that they will inherit. I am certain that we can
both agree on one thing - if we leave behind a polluted, damaged
world with a legacy of conflict and suffering, we will be deeply
ashamed. So I would like to focus today on the environment and the
prospect of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for Greenpeace, a 30-year old organisation that is
committed to non-violent direct action in order to secure a green
and peaceful world. We oppose the use of violence by all nations
and believe that each and every one must abide by international law
if we are to avoid the massive human carnage seen in the 20th
century. Sadly, both Iraq and the United States have flouted
international law, and it is the infractions by the US that set the
negative example for other nations that we trust and respect. The
result is the undermining of collaborative efforts to isolate
nations like Iraq that have threatened the use of weapons of mass
destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the environment, I am frustrated that your
administration has ignored pleas from across the country to protect
our environment. Yet I am grateful to live in a country where the
president must face the voting public in democratic elections.
Corporate lobbyists may make many walks down the West Wing of the
White House, but we the people still get to walk into that voting
booth every four years to make our voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, there are a number of key questions that must be
asked if we Americans, as activists, parents and engaged citizens,
are to understand our collective role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know why you opposed making our automobile fleet more
energy efficient when doing so would give us far more energy
independence from the Middle East. I want to know about the profits
that Vice President Cheney's former employer, Haliburton, made
during the 1990s providing oil services to Iraq. I want to know
about your campaign contributors like ExxonMobil and exactly how
much business they conducted with Saddam Hussein's regime in the
years since the last Gulf war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know how you plan to divvy up the windfall that you
expect Haliburton and the US oil companies to receive if you are
able to put a friendly regime in Iraq. According to Lawrence
Lindsey, one of your own top economic policy advisors, such a
regime change would double or triple the amount of oil produced
daily in Iraq, adding up to five million barrels a day. With
profits of approximately $5 per barrel, US companies currently
precluded from operating in Iraq could make up to $9 billion per
year. This figure does not include profits to oil services giants
like Haliburton, which would benefit greatly from the rebuilding of
oil wells, pipelines and storage and shipping infrastructure in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this much money at stake, it is hard not to ask some
disturbing questions. Should you decide to declare war, and Iraqi
citizens and American soldiers die in the effort, will these oil
profits be repatriated to the families of the victims? Will the
dollars be used to develop the renewable energy and energy
efficient technologies so that we will never have to fight another
war for oil? If the answers to these questions are negative, then
would we not be sending in troops simply to benefit the oil
industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know if you will be willing to support weapons
inspections, backed by the force of the United Nations, for both
Iraq and the United States. Given our own anthrax attacks at home,
there seem to be worrisome quantities of biological weapons agents,
and even pharmacological weapons, being created in the United
States, far in excess of the quantities agreed to
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most difficult question of all is what to tell our
daughters about Us dependence upon oil and your reluctance to help
us kick this deadly habit. I had a conversation in my kitchen with
my two daughters - Sophie, age 7, and Mollie, age 4 - the day after
the one-year anniversary of the September 11th attacks. They wanted
to know why people would want to kill us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughters were born, I thought the toughest conversation
I would ever have with them would be about boys. Now that
conversation is lower on the list of difficult subjects. This war
on terrorism is a very challenging one. It is about fanaticism and
people so angry and desperate that they resort to suicide attacks.
But even those topics I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don't know how to explain is why the United States is
simultaneously so admired and so hated by people the world
over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a country that prides itself on the ingenuity of its
people, on our ability to create whole new industries overnight
with speed, flexibility and confidence. And yet the Bush
administration chooses to keep our military stationed around the
world to protect oil supply lines back to the United States. We
choose to drive gas guzzling cars and SUVs and to anger much of the
world in the process. We choose to cede the future of super
efficient vehicle manufacturing to competitors around the world. We
choose to live the way we have grown accustomed to living, rather
than to adapt and get smarter. And we choose to indignantly stand
our ground as our 4.6 percent of the world's population emit 25
percent of the global warming pollution. These are not easy facts
to explain to today's younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end it comes down to hope. My daughters still believe
that any situation, no matter how bad or difficult, can be fixed by
an adult. As a result, I keep slogging away, keeping hope alive,
believing that someday we will break through and redirect our world
onto a far more peaceful path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mr. President, the crux of the issue is this.When all the
pollsters, advisors and consultants have gone home, you will have
to speak from your own heart and explain the mistakes of the past.
What, sir, are you going to tell your daughters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;John Passacantando is the executive director of Greenpeace USA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The wood oozes glamour and prestige in the gleaming showrooms of the north. But its plunder drives the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, corruption and even murder.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/greenpeace-amazonia-campainger.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Amazonia campainger Paulo Adario surrounded by illegal mahogany logs in the state of Para, Brazil.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wood is mahogany, but it's also known as "green gold". For
good reason. One log earns an astonishing US$ 130,000 by the time
it's transformed into the solid mahogany dining tables sold at
high-class stores such as Harrods of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With stakes so high, it's no surprise current measures to halt
the illegal mahogany trade are failing. Despite Brazil's moratorium
on the harvest and export of mahogany since last year, prospectors
still fly hundreds of kilometres looking for isolated mahogany
trees, then bulldoze illegal access roads through pristine
rainforest. The over-exploited wood continues to flow into elite
showrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahogany logging is the thin edge of the wedge driving massive
forest destruction throughout the heart of the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are solutions. The major players in the illegal
mahogany racket are well-known and relatively few. All that's
lacking is international resolve to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A tale of two kings...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two mahogany kingpins control more than 80 percent of
mahogany exports from Pará state, Brazil's largest mahogany
producing region. They are behind the mahogany mafia which
organises the illegal exploitation and trade in "green gold".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mightiest, Moisés Carvalho Pereira, is said to make an
astonishing US$ 1 million per day during the mahogany logging
season. He is said to be aided by an even more powerful friend; the
Brazilian senate's former president has been linked to the illegal
mahogany trade through Moisés.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Moisés buys logs from Kayapó Indian lands, which is
illegal, the Indians are paid just US$ 30 per cubic metre. The
mahogany is sold on the international market for more than 45 times
that amount. Moisés uses so-called legal paperwork to cover up and
launder the illegal mahogany. Local corruption and lax controls
make this deception easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kingpin Osmar Alves Ferreira also has a long history of
involvement in illegal mahogany coming from Indian lands. In 2001
Greenpeace exposed how Ferreira opened up an illegal road into the
Terra do Meio (the Middle Lands), a relatively undisturbed region
sheltering jaguars, alligators, spider monkeys and other animals
threatened with extinction. The road transports mahogany to a
sawmill run by a frontman for Ferreira, where Greenpeace found
illegally logged mahogany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Five nations...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does all this illegal mahogany go? Just five countries
- the US, Dominican Republic, UK, the Netherlands and Germany -
import virtually all the Brazilian mahogany exported from Pará
state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, which is the world's largest mahogany import market,
about half of the mahogany comes though exporters connected to the
two mahogany kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;And four importers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers should shun suppliers linked to illegal operations. But
they don't. And just four companies - DLH Nordisk, Aljoma Lumber, J
Gibson McIlvain Co Ltd and Intercontinental Hardwoods Inc - account
for more than 85 percent of the mahogany trade linked to the two
mahogany kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DLH is particularly notorious. In 2001, it bought mahogany from
all five export companies linked to the two mahogany kings. DLH has
also been linked to other forest crimes in central and west Africa,
including buying from companies linked with arms trafficking in
Liberia. The company controls half the international Brazilian
mahogany market, and supplies the US, UK, the Netherlands and
Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whether they know it or not, retailers are also aiding and
abetting in this high level crime. They include high-class outlets
like the US's Ethan Allen, Ralph Lauren and Harrods in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Hostages to deception and murder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging is illegal on Brazil's Indian lands, home to the
nation's largest remaining mahogany reserves. Yet by 1992 mahogany
logging penetrated all 15 Indian lands in Pará state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loggers' modus operandi is to fell the trees, then negotiate a
price with the Indians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, a fair and legal contract between Indians and
loggers has never been known. Once drawn into deal making, Indians
like the Kayapó have found themselves in debt bondage to sawmills,
forced to pay their debts with more mahogany logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unknown numbers of Indians have been murdered, a result of often
violent conflicts that flare up as they try to protect their land
from loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the picture of illegal mahogany logging in the
Brazilian Amazon is bleak, there is good news. Brazil extended the
moratorium on the exploitation, transport and commercialisation of
mahogany until February 2003. But this temporary measure is not
enough. Leading mahogany experts believe that mahogany will be
commercially extinct in the wild within the next two years if
current trends continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If international trade in mahogany is not going to lead the
species to commercial extinction, a rescue package to manage
mahogany in a sustainable way and effective international measures
to control the market are urgently needed. This kind of protection
is possible through CITES (the Convention on the International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, CITES member countries will meet in Santiago, Chile
and mahogany is high on the agenda. Nicaragua has submitted a
proposal, on behalf of all Central America countries, to list
mahogany on Appendix II of the convention. This listing would
require guarantees of legal origin and proper harvest management of
the species that does not threaten its survival. This would be the
first step from words and good intentions towards concrete action
to protect mahogany and the rainforests of Central and South
America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the pressure from the industry on governments is intense.
The mahogany trade is big business. The mahogany kings in Brazil
stand to lose a lot of their illegal and destructive business if
the CITES proposal is approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help put pressure on the Brazilian government to support
the listing of Mahogany on CITES Appendix II and show the
international community that the exploitation and marketing of
"green gold" of the rainforest can happen without plundering the
future of the Amazon or the millions of people that depend on
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Take action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists are celebrating Spanish nuclear regulators' "death sentence" for the Jose Cabrera plant in Zorita, that nation's oldest nuclear reactor. But the landmark September decision did not come easily. Ageing and ailing though they may be, Spain's nuclear reactors have lofty friends.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists on the dome of the Zorita nuclear power plant.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governing Partido Popular party has strongly promoted people
like Loyola de Palacio and Teresa Estavan Bolea, people who want
you forget this is a dangerous, expensive and polluting
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Palacio's fervent pro-nuclear message resonates far beyond
Spain. She uses her position as EU Energy Commissioner and Vice
President to boost nuclear power as a way to tackle climate change.
She doesn't seem to understand that substituting one disaster for
another is hardly a solution; in May she proudly cheered Findland's
logic-defying decision to build a new reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back on Spanish soil the unabashedly pro-nuclear
Estavan Bolea uses her position as Chair of the Spanish Nuclear
Safety Council (known by its Spanish acronym CSN) to try to soften
nuclear legislation, and promote like-minded people to key
technical decision-making positions in the Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain has no new reactors planned, so Estavan Bolea concentrates
her efforts on breathing new life into current plants, hoping to
extend their lifespan to 60 years. She fought fiercely and
unilaterally to add an extra ten years to the operating license of
the 34-year-old Zorita plant, located 50 kilometres northeast of
Madrid. Operated by the Union Fenosa power company, it has
technical problems, including rust and cracks in its reactor
vessel, and has released radioactive material into the air, toward
the nearby Tajo River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Estavan Bolea proved no match for opposition to the obsolete
plant, which included Greenpeace and other social and political
groups. One highlight was the widely-reported April storming of the
plant by six Greenpeace activists. They scaled its dome to protest
the plant's decrepit state and highlight security risks. A CSN
investigation into the plant followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landmark September decision marks the first scheduled
closure of a Spanish nuclear plant for technical and safety
reasons. The affair put Estavan Bolea's obvious pro-nuclear bias
under the spotlight, as her shameless pro-nuclear song dragged the
CSN's reputation to historic lows. A regulatory body controlling an
industry as dangerous as nuclear power must base its decisions on
technical realities, not political motives. The CSN urgently
requires legal reform, increased transparency and citizen
participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dark cloud for activists is the CSN decision to allow the
Zorita plant to operate until 2006, prolonging its risk to public
health and the environment. Still, the reactor's death sentence
should give pro-nuclear forces pause before they attempt to prop up
other ageing Spanish reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Once a ship, now toxic waste</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/it-s-no-longer-a-ship/</url><text>
	It’s no longer a ship.  It used to be a car ferry, but then there was a fire.  The fire burned for a week.  Then the ship, the Greek owned Silver Ray, was declared a “construction total loss”.  In other words, now it’s not a ship.  It’s a 200 metre long floating toxic waste site bound for a scrap yard.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/projecting-images-of-poor-cond.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/projecting-images-of-poor-cond.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists use a banner, hung on the Silver Ray (soon to be scraped) and projector to show the poor conditions at shipbreaking yards.   In the foreground is the Argus.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Greenpeace activists who have been on board since last
night, it's also an opportunity to say how shipbreaking is done
wrong, and how it can be done right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They hung a banner from over the ship's side. It wasn't your
regular Greenpeace banner - it had a big blank space in the middle.
Activists projected images in the blank space - showing what will
happen if this ship is sent for scrapping before the toxic
materials are cleaned out. The screen showed people picking up
asbestos with their bare hands, oil in the paint and the
water…business as usual at ship breaking yards in places like
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they activists deployed a new banner, "Toxic waste: Clean
up now", and (after some negotiations with the police) they stayed
on the deck overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning more activists arrived with two independent
experts - one specializing in asbestos, and the other in general
toxic contamination. The specialists took samples from the ship to
begin assessing the toxins on board. The work only continued for an
hour before the police arrived and ordered everyone off the
ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ordered, the specialists left, but an analysis of the samples
they took with them will be ready next week. For now, four
Greenpeace activists remain on board the burned out Silver Ray, and
others are using the Argus (a Greenpeace boat) to visit crews on
other ships in the Antwerp harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ship owners must provide public inventories of hazardous
materials on their ships as a matter of routine and guarantee
dangerous substances are safely removed before vessels are
scrapped. By failing to do this, they're exposing thousands of
workers in Asia directly to poisons and causing catastrophic
environmental problems," said Frank, a Greenpeace campaigner on
board the Argus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sailors, and other people who work around ships, can be a big
help in Greenpeace's work to protect the workers and environment at
ship breaking sites. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/spot-a-ship.asp" target="blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; if you are in a position to aid our

	Mostly, Lucy spends her time at a desk on the fifth floor of the Greenpeace office in Amsterdam, but somehow she has smuggled herself on board the Rainbow Warrior.  Now, for 16 days, she will scrub toilets, paint decks, help out with cetacean spotting and otherwise lead the good life.

            Lucy on board the Rainbow Warrior
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, 9th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aberystwyth, despite being unpronounceable to at least 98
percent of the global population, turned out to be a pretty nice
town. I had spent the last couple of weeks having conversations
with the Greenpeace Crew Manager that went along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Tanya, where shall I meet the ship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Aber er..er abersinthwit or something um pardon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aber..oh god Absynth-thingy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absynth-who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets just call it the A-place. It's in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So having survived Birmingham and a three hour train ride
through the gorgeous green and lumpy Welsh countryside, it came as
quite a relief last night to finally see the Rainbow Warrior, my
home for the next 16 days, anchored off the Welsh coast. I had
obviously found the right, A-place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, John the logistics coordinator and general
man-with-a-plan had it all under control from then on. At
Aberystwyth Marina, we met up with the five scientists from the
Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society who were coming on board to
carry out a five week survey of cetaceans, that's whales and
dolphins, along the welsh coast. They had a huge pile of equipment
which we helped cart down the jetty on trolleys. As I pushed my
heavy trolley down the steep slope, it took on a life of its own
and made a bid for freedom towards the murky waters beneath.
Luckily, a few of us together managed to restrain it and prevent
the survey equipment from a cold swim. It would not have been a
good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my first time on board the Rainbow Warrior. Although I
have been working for Greenpeace for three years, I have never
actually made it on board our international superstar flagship
before. As our rib (rigged hulled inflatable boat) pulled up
alongside the familiar white-on-green Greenpeace logo, I noticed
that everyone in our little troupe of RW novices was grinning with
excitement. It felt like we were climbing on board a celebrity.
This is a ship that has inspired people around the world, that was
rammed and stormed by French commandos while it was opposing
nuclear testing, that this year opposed a nuclear waste shipment
and protested against forest destruction...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I toppled dreamily overboard in a fit of nostalgia, I was
brought back down to earth - or rather sea - by George, the first
mate. There was a list of things that we needed to know about life
on board that we should learn fast if we were to avoid being made
to walk the plank by the rest of the crew. Most important was
water. Despite being surrounded on all sides by the stuff, fresh
water is in short supply on ships. So long hot Radox baths are out.
ONE shower a day said George, in capital letters, TWO minutes only
each time. I nod and try and look tough and rugged, a bit like Xena
Warrior Princess. I can tell its not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on board we meet the rest of the crew and Derek, the
Captain, who has been a Greenpeace captain for seven years. We are
given a tour of the ship from Claire the Radio Operator and High
Priestess of Teccie-ness and on the way we meet Dave the Dolphin -
a wooden carving that sits on the Bow (the front of the ship) that
was donated to us by a sculptor in Germany. Legend has it that he
hid a time capsule inside Dave, with messages of hope for the
future. We also meet a small and scary ceramic gnome with no nose
that lives on the bridge (the place from which the Captain and
mates steer the ship). Ruth, one of the other deckhands, appears to
be quite attached to him, but I think he has evil eyes and should
be thrown overboard immediately. He definitely looks
suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some great food prepared by the ship cook, Marco, we head
down to our cabin to make up our beds. I clamber into a top bunk
and get rocked to sleep by the gentle swell. It is only 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 10th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/sunrise.jpg" alt="Sunrise." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;At 7:30 we get a wake up call from the crew member
who has been on watch duty. We groan a bit, but in fact three of us
have been awake for at least an hour, paranoid about missing the
call and getting in trouble for oversleeping on the first
morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always have a problem getting out of bed, but this morning the
problem took on a whole new dimension since I had to figure out a
way to get out of my high bunk, which has wooden walls around the
sides to stop you falling out if the weather gets rough. It was
pretty easy to get into, but manoeuvring yourself over the wall and
down to the floor is more tricky, especially with your eyes sticky
and ankles and knees stiff from a night of sleeping. I jump and
crash to the ground. If the boat sinks because of an inexplicably
shaped hole in the cabin floor then you know who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eat breakfast and at eight I report to Simon the Bosun, who
is the deckhand's boss and therefore master of my life over the
next couple of weeks. Despite the many horror stories I have heard
about cruel and evil bosuns who work their deckhands to pulp, Simon
turns out to be a very nice guy with no cat-o-nine-tails
immediately obvious. (Yes, I know. Of course, I would say that
that, since I have another two weeks left on the boat under his
command. But honestly, he seems like a very reasonable man. And if
at any time during the rest of this diary it sounds like I'm
sucking up to him, then it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the
fact that he is my boss. Really.) So anyway, charming and handsome
Simon tells me to start by helping out with the cleaning that
happens every day between eight and 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six other deckhands - Henri, Ruth, Mariana, Ed, Will
and Meredith - and they are all walking around in overalls and
t-shirts covered in paint and grease stains, like badges of honour.
Next to them, my old but clean jeans and sweater look pretty
amateur. Luckily I find some 5th hand overalls in the hold (bottom
of the ship) which are pre-splattered with vast amounts of grease
and paint. In fact, they are more paint than material. I put them
on and feel immediately better. I feel as if I have been working
incredibly hard for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back to the mess (that's the room we eat in) I am
slightly concerned to find the other deckhands vying over who gets
to clean the toilets. Apparently it's one of the better jobs. This
is not a good sign. Figuring that as the most junior deckhand on
board I have absolutely no chance of winning the toilet cleaning
contest, I look around for something else to do and one of the
deckhands explains to me about the garbage system on the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every tiny piece of rubbish on board is separated: glass,
plastic, aluminium, paper and organic waste all get sorted into
different bins so that as much as possible can be re-used or
recycled. The person in charge of all this is called the Chief
Garbologist, a position which I immediately aspire to just because
the name is so great. I help clean the pantry and the wet room, and
then go back to Simon for more tasks. He sends me down to the
engine room to do some painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine room, in the belly of the ship, is hot, noisy and
smells strongly of, well, engines I guess. We have to put ear
protection on before going in because the noise is so loud. It's
bizarre, because the ear masks distort and magnify the sounds that
your own body makes, a bit like going under water. If you swallow,
it sounds like someone has just flushed a toilet. If you yawn, it
sounds like a running tap. Or perhaps that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine room is being painted all the colours of the rainbow,
and I wonder if this is Greenpeace just taking it a bit too far.
But Mario, Chief Engineer, explains to me that this is standard
practice on ships, with different pipes being painted different
colours according to what they carry. Blue pipes carry cooling
water. Green pipes carry seawater. It makes sense. After a coffee
break at ten, we add face masks (to protect us from breathing the
fumes) to our ear protectors and begin to look more like extras in
Dr. Who than Greenpeace deckhands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch is at 12 and, as with all the food so far, is fantastic.
Marco, the cook, manages to create options for vegetarians and
vegans as well as meat eaters. It makes a huge difference to have
meals that you really look forward to. Everyone eats together in
the mess, and everyone does their own washing up in the pantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/scientists.jpg" alt="Research." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;In the afternoon, Simon lets me help out the guys
from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS from now on)
with their research (can the flattery be working already?). This
afternoon they are setting up equipment and checking their
methodology. I am asked to take up a survey position on one side of
the boat and to section of sea for any sign of dolphin and
porpoises. What's the difference? I ask Mark, the Science Director
of WDCS. He tells me that in this part of the world, dolphins are
bigger than porpoises and porpoises have different teeth and fins
to dolphins. They also behave quite differently: Harbour porpoises
are more shy and you are only likely to get a quick glimpse of
them, often hiding behind a wave. Bottlenose dolphins are much more
likely to come and investigate a passing ship and see what s going
on. Bottlenose dolphins also have the habit of Bow riding. That's
when they swim alongside the front of the boat and use the water
currents caused by the ships movement to push them along. Basically
they hitch a free ride. It looks like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stand at my post and look. And look. I don t see anything.
Apart from sea. It's weird, because if you stare at the sea for
long enough it starts to look different. It's like one of those 3-D
pictures that you have to stare at for 20 minutes, before the
ziggly lines turn into a picture of the Coliseum. Or Jane Fonda.
The sea stops being an endless mass of the same thing and you start
to see patterns and details. It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/dolphin.jpg" alt="Just visiting." width="135" height="180" hspace="3" align="right"&gt;After an hour or so of looking there's a shout from
the other side of the boat. Three bottleneck dolphins are bow
riding! We all leg-it up to the front of the boat and look down at
them swimming effortlessly along - surfacing and diving back down
and surfacing gracefully again. It's magical. This is what we are
all here for. The dolphins stay with us for a few minutes and then
suddenly they are gone. Just like that. We look and look, hoping
they'll come back, but they have obviously lost interest in us.
Perhaps we'll see them again later on in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another hour or so its raining and cold and even my
Peruvian balaclava cannot protect me from the cold any longer. I
head inside and warm up. I'll be in bed soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 11th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day starts like yesterday, with a 7:30 wake up call and a
sleepy breakfast. Today I am shown how to clean the toilets (or
Heads as they are called on ships. I haven t figured out why yet. I
hope it hasn't got anything to do with the frequency of throwing
up). Then its back down to the engine room, this time for some
serious scrubbing. We have to prepare some walls for painting, but
they are behind a whole load of pipes and equipment and they are
difficult to reach. Its dirty work and by 11 am Henri and I have
aching necks and shoulders from contorting ourselves into strange
positions. Just then, George comes down to find us to let us know
that there are bottlenoses bow riding again. We race upstairs and
arrive just in time to see them disappear again. They're here and
then they re gone again said Will, fellow deckhand like Keizer
Soese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/mark.jpg" alt="Mark." width="135" height="180" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;In
the afternoon I'm back in position surveying the sea, just off
Aberystwyth. Mark has had his hat stolen by the wind and is mildly
distraught, since it had sentimental value. "I have two spares
though", he confided. It's cold and we are being spat at by the
rain, but I have a Greenpeace survival suit on and feel invincible,
in a telly-tubby kind of way. But I don't see much and after a
couple of hours head back into the warmth of the mess to drink hot
ribena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go for a nap at seven, with the full intention of getting up
again in an hour or so. Ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, 12th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up at about four being thrown about in my bunk. The sea is
getting frisky. Half an hour later I hear an extremely loud Clang
Clang Clang and wonder if this is what sinking sounds like. I
realise slowly that it is the anchor being hauled up, which means
that we are on the move. The waves are so strong that we are being
dragged towards the shore. We need to find calmer waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try and breathe with the movement of my bunk and focus on
taking each wave as it comes. In my sleepiness I know that I should
take a sea-sickness tablet, but they are in my cupboard, which
means getting out of bed. And getting out of bed means taking a
flying leap into the darkness and onto a moving target (the floor).
I feel that as long as I stay in the safety of my bunk, I'll be
OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at 7:30 the Knock comes and I have to get up. I have a bad
feeling about this. We are all thrown around as we struggle into
our clothes and head up to the mess. Breakfast is definitely out,
so I try to get on with the cleaning. But all I can manage is
putting away teaspoons because I feel hot and sweaty and dizzy. I
ask Henri as calmly as possible where I should throw up (there is
strict ship etiquette for this, I m sure) and she directs me to the
bucket in our cabin or the heads. I lurch down the corridor, trying
to smile at the Captain en route, and get as far as a toilet. You
can imagine the rest for yourselves, so I'll spare you the details.
Surprisingly, I feel better almost straight away and collapse
asleep on the day bed in our cabin. When I wake up a few hours
later, the sea is calm and the sun shiny. It's a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, 13th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day off for the crew. Watched movies in the mess and played
guitar. Food has taken on a whole new dimension since yesterday's
events, and I'm beginning to wonder if it really is such a blessing
to have a great cook on board. His lasagne smelled wonderful, but
it really takes the pleasure out of eating when you are wondering
whether you'll be seeing the food back again in a couple of hours
if there is rough weather. Some cruel sadist has even brought some
chocolate hobnob biscuits on board, surely the best food ever
invented in the history of mankind. The Temptation. But oh,the
Regret?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, 14th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about living on board a ship is that you have to learn
a whole new language. Apart from the terms "Port, Starboard, Stern
and Bow" which I learnt in the Brownies aged about six, I am a
total foreigner when it comes to nautical language. The crew eats,
drinks, plays chess and plots in the "mess". That's easy to
remember. I wonder which word came first - "mess" or "messy"? A
staircase is a "companionway", locks on outside doors are known as
"dogs" and "leech" is ship speak for the back edge of a sail. It's
all very confusing and only slightly less painful than learning
Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Manuel in Fawlty Towers lots of the time - I had a
conversation today that went something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what's going on: "Clip on the bow
line"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: "Uhh?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what's going on: "The bow line"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (trying to say it in a more intelligent sounding way):
"Uhh?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what is going on and being very
patient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, not the one with the Monkey's Fist. The other one."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (Confused. Then experiencing moment of dull comprehension,
like the chimps in 2001: Space Odyssey): "Uhhhh!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person who understands what is going on: "OK, now release the
Elephant Nozzle"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: "Uhhh???"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on. Sometimes I wonder if they are making it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the Heads (which, if you have been paying attention
carefully, you will know means "toilet") there is a glossary of
ship speak on the wall, presumably for us to study during quiet
solitary moments. I figure that this will be the solution to all my
problems. Until I attempt to read it. A "Baggy Wrinkle", it tells
me, "prevents sails from chafing on shrouds". And a "Preventer:
prevents gaff from swinging inboard". Whose shroud? Whose gaff?
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?? I resolve to keep quiet and just nod and
smile a lot from now on. That usually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a happy afternoon taking winches apart in order to
grease them. They are quite tricky since they have all sorts of
springs and ball bearings which are liable to jump out and spring
or roll away across the deck into the great unknown. Luckily Ed, a
fellow deckhand, knows what he is doing and warns me about the
dangers. Ed even knows how to put the winches back together again,
which is more than can be said for me. Though since there are 21
winches on board, all of which have to be greased, I guess I will
learn sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up having another early night - 10pm seems late around
here. As I climb up into my bunk, it hits me that our cabin feels a
bit like being at a boarding school. Or rather a weird cross
between boarding school, boot camp and Glastonbury all at the same
time. Four girls share the cabin, which has two bunk beds, a sink,
a small table and a big stereo. We each have a cupboard to put our
stuff in, and the other cupboards house towels and sheets for the
rest of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are scary notices on the wall which warn us not to run in
the alleyways, not to talk loudly in the alleyways, not to slam
doors and not to shower between 7:30 and 9am. There is actually
good reason for all of this: ships work 24 hours a day since
someone always has to be on watch, which means that there is also
someone sleeping at any time in the day. It's hard to remember when
you get (or, in my case, jump with flailing arms) out of bed in the
morning that somebody has been on watch from four until eight and
is probably just settling down to get some well-earned kip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also lots of stickers on the walls with campaign
slogans and "I woz here" messages from former inhabitants of our
bunks. Its great tracing the history of the ship and the people who
have been on board back through the sticker graffiti. As I snooze,
I wonder about the scores of activists and Greenpeacers who have
lain in exactly the same bunk over the last 13 years, and the
stories that they could tell. Unfortunately, I find myself getting
distracted by the question of the square meter area that would be
covered by their aggregate beards. I'm going to have nightmares.
It's time to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, 16th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bleary-eyed morning starts with the news that Jan - one of
the WDCS researchers - decided to go for a swim at 6:30 this
morning. In the Irish Sea in mid October. She just jumped in. To me
the idea of immersing myself in icy water in the small hours is
only slightly less appealing than being slowly eaten alive by a
team of wombats, but others on board did a good job of pretending
not to be impressed by her barmy bathing behaviour. "Bit warm in
there for me," said Justin, "I like to break the ice when I go for
a dip". Fortunately, Jan is leaving the ship today so will not here
to make the rest of us feel inadequate for the rest of the
tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inflatable is going to take Jan and Justin ashore to return
their normal lives and I am allowed to go along for the ride. Simon
(remember him? He's the witty, strong, handsome one) is driving and
once we pull away from the ship we go pretty fast, bouncing along
on the waves with a light spray in our faces. At Pwllheli we drop
off Jan and Justin and collect Tom, another scientist, who is
coming on board for a couple of days. Heading back to the ship, we
thump up and down on the sea again and I feel the wind in my hair
and lick the salt from my lips. Life on the ocean wave feels pretty
good right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I help with painting the hold. The hold is a
big area in the belly of the ship where all sorts of things are
stored, including bikes, kayaks and of course hundreds of banners.
We are using this period of time in which there are no actions to
completely repaint this area from floor to ceiling. Allegedly this
is because we want it to look nice for "Open Boat" days - when we
open up the boat for the public to come on board to see the ship. I
happen to know that it is actually because Dimitri (2nd Mate) and
Mario (Chief Engineer) want to have a grand table-tennis hall in
which to wage their ping-pong battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I consider myself to be quite a careful person, within
20 minutes of starting painting I am about 90 percent covered in
paint. I have paint in my hair, paint on my shoes, all over my arms
and ...oooh, itchy eye... yep - paint all over my face. A nice grey
stripe across my eyebrow so that I suddenly bear more than a
passing resemblance to Adam Ant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by painting the floor, and then move onto the mast and
shelves. We have to squidge into all the nooks and crannies and the
contorted positions we end in up would make a yoga guru proud. When
we break for coffee, I spend half of the break trying to scrub the
paint off my hands. In the Mess there is a message on the
noticeboard saying "No bare hands on the Cheese". Apparently there
are literally fingerprints on the Edam. There was another notice
that read "No dirty working clothes in the Mess", but some bright
spark changed the "clothes" to "class" fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/bottlenose_dolphins.jpg" alt="Bottlenose dolphins." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;Later in the afternoon there is a shout that a
family of dolphins is bow-riding. There is the usual scramble to
get up to the front of the ship and about 18 bottle-noses are
swooshing elegantly through the water, criss-crossing each other's
paths and then falling in with each other's movements in perfect
synchrony. They hang around for about 15 minutes and then all
disappear together, in one movement, as if they are attached by
invisible threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight is the night that I finally get to wash my hair. I have
been saving up my two-minutes-per-day of shower credits, so I
reckon tonight I am entitled to up to six minutes of hot liquid
bliss. When I'm done and am feeling all new and shiny, Mark points
out to me that I still have large streaks of surf grey paint
covering about a sixth of my head. I decide not to worry about it.
At least its gloss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 17th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's back down to continue work on painting the hold. We are
bemused to find that a part of the floor that we didn't get round
to finishing yesterday is this morning wet with surf grey paint. It
turns out that Dimitri, frustrated by the slow progress towards the
completion of his ping-pong palace, came down here at 4:30am last
night to hurry things along a bit. I guess he must really like ping
pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the floor is still covered with a pile of ropes so we
need to move them to an already-painted area. They are arranged
into huge coils to keep them under control. You really do not want
to get one of these ropes tangled up - they are enormous and very
heavy - and unravelling a serious knot would probably take several
strong crew and a long time. I feed the ropes to Ed, who curls them
neatly into coils. Although it sounds easy enough, the weight of
the ropes make my puny shoulder-muscles ache. A bit pathetic I
know, but then again the diameter of the rope is about twice that
of my upper arm, so perhaps its excusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get on with covering the floor, shelves and ourselves with
paint throughout the day, singing along to Morcheeba and the
Levellers, which through our facemasks sounds like the noise a
vacuum cleaner makes when you suck up a sock by mistake. By the
time we've finished, Ping-Pong Paradise is looking pretty smart and
we are feeling quite proud of ourselves. Apart from the fact that
one of us always manages to forget about a wet bit of floor and
tread in it, so that there is always just a bit more rollering to
do to cover up the footprints. This continues
Laurel-and-Hardy-style for a while, so I wonder if we will ever
actually make it to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marco has cooked the best pizza in the history of Italian mamas,
and I wolf it down, pushing thoughts of tonight's dire gale
warnings as far into the back of my head as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 18th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After none of the predicted gales and a stunning sunrise, we
begin the morning's work as usual with half an hour of cleaning.
This morning I pick up the brush for cleaning the toilets with not
so much as a murmur of dissent from my fellow deckhands. The same
thing happened yesterday, and I am beginning to get suspicious.
Despite two consecutive days of toilet cleaning, I can't honestly
say that I have discovered the joy in it yet, and when I look back
to vying over the toilet cleaning during my first days on board
(first deckhand: "I'm cleaning the toilets", second deckhand: "No,
I am, I am" third deckhand "Ooooh let me, let me") I suspect that
this may well be a scam they pull on all naïve new deckhands. It
certainly worked on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25845/simon.jpg" alt="Simon investigates." width="180" height="135" hspace="3" align="left"&gt;There is a strange knocking noise coming from
somewhere below the ship, and the Captain is worried that we may
have something - perhaps a buoy or a lobster pot - snagged
underneath. Simon, our hero, volunteers to do some investigative
snorkelling, and becomes the second person in three days to leap
into the chilly waters of the Irish sea. When he surfaces again, he
reports that whatever it was has unsnagged itself: the lobster-pot
crisis has been averted and we can all return to our chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there is enough wind to put the sails up and the Warrior
looks fantastic with the white sails billowing in the wind. It's a
gorgeous day, with blue skies and bright white candyfloss clouds,
and I try and sneak in a few photos of the crew and scientists
between painting. There are lots of birds around - gannets,
kittewakes, razorbills, guillimots, and cormorants - which squawk
and soar and feed on great balls of fish in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's Friday night, and Will decides to organise a pub quiz to
make up for the fact that we can't get to a real pub tonight. My
team - the Randy Risso's - is coming a close second as we go into
the final round - the "name that dolphin fin" questions.
Unfortunately, since Will has chosen the . . . er . . lesser known
species such as the Indus River Dolphin and the Vaquita dolphin to
test us on, everyone in the room scores zero, and the Randy Risso's
go home empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;

	As two British nuclear freighters near the Irish Sea with their deadly cargo of weapons-usable plutonium, a flotilla of small sailboats are getting into position to peacefully protest their passage.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Jim Corr of Irish pop group the Corrs, takes the helm of a Greenpeace inflatable while lending his support to the Nucelar Free Seas Flottila.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior, is also in the Irish
Sea to support the flotilla. Together they will ensure that the
passage of this deadly and dangerous shipment will get as much
global attention as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish the UK and Japanese governments had enough integrity and
backbone not to put people around the world in danger by shipping
weapons usable-plutonium past their coasts. The huge groundswell of
protest from 80 en-route governments, many thousands of individuals
and seafarers wishing to stop their oceans becoming nuclear
highways, has so far fallen on deaf ears. The upcoming peaceful
protest in the Irish Sea will perhaps be the one that breaks the
silence and elicits the response that we all want; cancel all
further shipments, phase out nuclear power and invest in clean,
safe energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla is to make
sure this shipment does not pass unnoticed - to hopefully raise
enough of a ruckus to make this the last shipment and to get the
Sellafield nuclear plant shut down. As the nuclear ships approach
and the flotilla and the Rainbow Warrior have been readying
themselves for action, there has been an amazing outpouring of
support from the Irish government and people. The Irish navy will
be sending a patrol boat to monitor the shipment, and the Irish
Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, made a surprise visit to the Rainbow
Warrior on Wednesday to express his support and admiration for the
members of the flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipper Cormac Kavanagh explained his motivation for joining the
flotilla, "What else can we do? We would all prefer not to have to
do this, but what would we say to our children if the worst came to
the worst? I just could not say 'I didn't care enough to take
action',"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We owe the people who care enough, like Cormac, to take action,
a huge debt. The nuclear industry has been flying in the face of
global protest against their activities for long enough - it is now
time for us to make them listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us by &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/ship_crew.html"&gt;witnessing
the passage of the nuclear titanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

you can join our &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf3&amp;amp;s=vf"&gt;virtual

	One of the most dangerous and unnecessary shipments ever to have taken place reached journeys end on September 17th 2002 when it docked in the UK port of Barrow. The effect that this shipments 18,000 mile, 75-day passage, through some of the worlds heaviest seas had on the governments and peoples of en-route nations, and those who want to protect the fragile marine environment through which it sailed, could be likened to the running of a knife through an open wound.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/surrounded-by-japanese-police.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/surrounded-by-japanese-police.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Surrounded by Japanese police and coast guards Greenpeace inflatables protest beneath kites from  the Mv Arctic Sunrise
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar transports of plutonium waste material have taken place
before and have been protested and condemned by en-route
governments, communities and non-governmental organisations.
However, the global outpouring of protest ignited by this latest
shipment surpasses previous levels by quite some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty governments sent strong messages opposing the shipment
including very strong statements and support for the protests
against it from the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Ireland,
Helen Clark and Bertie Ahern. Three groups of seafarers, united by
their love of the sea and indignation at how the sea and those that
depend on it were being risked, formed protest flotillas at
strategic points along the potential routes the shipment could
take. Many thousands more 'landlubber' individuals, as concerned as
the 'real' flotilla protestors but boatless, or without sea-legs,
joined Greenpeace's virtual flotilla to protest the oceans becoming
nuclear highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, three global events and some major industry scandals
punctuated the plutonium transport's perilous passage around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these events was the Korea/Japan World Cup. We
suspect that BNFL and the British and Japanese Governments timed
the ships' arrival in Japan to coincide with the tournament, in the
hope that media attention would be diverted. We leave you to judge
whether this suspected strategy worked or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the second two events only helped to focus more
attention on the shipments. The ships passed by South Africa only a
week before the World Summit on Sustainable Development. This shone
a spotlight on the absurdity of the ships, with their cargo of
dirty and dangerous energy, passing the world's largest ever
environmental conference, which was supposed to be agreeing
timelines for 2 billion of the world's poor to receive clean, safe
energy. The final event, less than a week ahead of the ships'
arrival in Barrow, was the first anniversary of 9/11 - a time when
everybody's thoughts turned to security amidst the threat from
terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the nuclear industry in both Japan and the UK
has been reeling from serious financial and safety scandals. TEPCO,
the Japanese utility due to load plutonium MOX fuel into its
Fukushima and Kashiwazaki-Kariwa reactors, admitted it had
falsified safety data on its reactors for the past decade. Heads
rolled, and the impact on public confidence in the industry
resulted in the immediate announcement of a freeze in any plutonium
MOX use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, British Energy, the major nuclear utility alongside
BNFL and a key customer for BNFL's Sellafield reprocessing plant,
announced it had joined BNFL in effectively being bankrupt and
asked the UK government for a bailout. City watchdogs are now
investigating the financial probity of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these developments can only severely undermine confidence
in the nuclear industry's claims about the safety and need for
plutonium programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was it about this shipment that focused global concern
as never before? A combination of the following probably gets you
your answer, but we welcome &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/"&gt;further suggestions&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- a groundswell of anger from those affected has been building
up from past shipments;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- this was the first shipment of weapons-usable plutonium post
9/11, or;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- the fact that those responsible for the provision and
perpetuation of nuclear power, of which the plutonium trade is an
essential part, suffered an annus horribilis of cover-ups,
bankruptcies and insolvencies, safety lapses and failures in plant
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What possibly became clearer to a wider public than ever before,
as the shipment progressed, was that The Pacific Pintail and
Pacific Teal were becoming potent symbols of the nuclear industry's
failure as all of the above stories played out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the results, we hope, will be that many more people will
not only question the need for further dangerous shipments to take
place, but that they will go further and question the need for
nuclear power at all. In saying this, we fully recognise that
nuclear power cannot just vanish overnight and has to be phased out
gradually. There are huge stockpiles of plutonium in the UK, Japan
and elsewhere which have to be stored safely and nuclear plants
have to be decommissioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are certain about, and hope that many more are also
aware of as a result of the global coverage the issue received, is
that any further investment in the provision of nuclear power
should be switched immediately to the provision of clean, safe
energy. The only funds invested in the nuclear industry from now on
should be spent on closing it down safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>nuclear</value><value>ireland</value><value>japan</value><value>nuclear power</value><value>bnfl</value><value>sellafield</value><value>reprocessing</value></taxonomy><date>2002-09-19 00:00:00</date></item>

            Greenpeace activists and Bhopal residents placed a monument at the Dow headoffice in Terneuzen, Netherlands.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of socially responsible investment firms, with combined
assets valued at $13 billion, are urging Dow Chemical Company to
address the ongoing economic, health and environmental liabilities
stemming from a poisonous gas leak in Bhopal, India in 1984, which
has killed and injured tens of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investors, Trillium Asset Management, Domini Social
Investments, Calvert Group and others, sent a letter to Dow's Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Parker and board Chair, William
Stavropoulos, asking them to "continue dialogue with
representatives of Bhopal citizens groups, to take their claims
seriously, and to work towards a mutually acceptable solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter comes as the chemical industry is gathering in New
York for the 13th annual Salomon Smith Barney Chemical Conference,
which will feature a presentation by Parker. "I can not think of a
more fitting occasion to deliver this letter than at a conference
in which the future of the chemical industry in the U.S. will be
discussed," said Steve Lippman of Trillium Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On the 18th anniversary of arguably the world's largest
industrial disaster, and at a time when the public has never been
more concerned about corporate responsibility, Dow must address the
ongoing problems of the citizens of Bhopal. Even after all these
years, children born to survivors suffer debilitating illnesses,
and mothers exposed to contaminated drinking water carry mercury in
their breast milk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2001, Dow Chemical purchased Union Carbide, the
owners of the pesticide plant in Bhopal during the accident.
Already this year, Dow has settled asbestos lawsuits filed against
Union Carbide in the US - part of the liabilities it assumed as a
result of the Carbide buyout - but it has so far refused to take
any responsibility for the pending liabilities connected to the
Bhopal disaster. This includes a Class Action in New York and an
ongoing criminal case in the Indian courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the asbestos litigation, Dow's stock fell a dramatic
£7 billion dollars due to investor fears of further damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warrant for the arrest of Union Carbide's ex-CEO Warren
Anderson on charges of "culpable homicide" has been out since 1992,
charges that were reaffirmed by the Central Magistrates Court,
Bhopal, in August. India's Home Affairs Minister and Foreign
Affairs Minister confirmed in October that India will formally ask
for Anderson's extradition from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India's Central Bureau of Investigation also announced in August
that it would move to name Dow Chemical in the Bhopal criminal case
in place of Union Carbide. The Indian State of Madhya Pradesh, of
which Bhopal is the capital, followed this by saying that it would
ask the Indian courts to compel Dow Chemical to pay for the clean
up of the contamination polluting the soil and ground water around
the abandoned factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal has long been
pressing Union Carbide, and now Dow, to provide for adequate health
care for gas survivors, and to clean up hundreds of tonnes of toxic
waste that was abandoned at the factory site by Union Carbide when
it fled Bhopal after the disaster. Two days ago, on the 18th
anniversary of the disaster, over 200 women from Bhopal made a
procession through central Bombay and delivered soil and water
contaminated by the toxic waste at the site, to Dow Chemical's
headquarters in India. The women also delivered 4,000 brooms to the
company with a message to Dow that it must clean up its mess in
Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow, whose $28 billion in annual sales make it the world's
largest chemical manufacturer, has recently associated itself with
a number of prominent 'sustainable development' initiatives,
including the World Business Council for Sustainable Development
and the chemical industry's own 'Responsible Care' programme of
self-regulation. 'Responsible Care', which was developed through a
partnership of Union Carbide and Dow in the immediate aftermath of
the Bhopal disaster has, as one of its abiding principles, the
promise "to work with others to resolve problems associated with
past handling and disposal practices".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poisonous gas leak at the Bhopal pesticide factory in 1984
left 8,000 people dead within three days. To date, more than 20,000
have died from ongoing health problems associated with exposure to
the lethal gases, and up to 150,000 survivors are chronically ill.
Much of the abandoned factory remains, with tons of toxic chemicals
left on site, leaching into the soil and contaminating some of the
communities' drinking water. Survivors do not have adequate health
care, and received an average of USD$500 each from a settlement
negotiated by the Indian government with Union Carbide without the
survivors' consent. The sum is barely enough to cover medical
expenses for five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's not surprising that investment firms are becoming
increasingly concerned about Dow's continued failure to accept its
pending liabilities in Bhopal. Questions over its integrity and
ethics are bound to increase while people in Bhopal will continue
to be poisoned daily. Dow needs to respond to these concerns by
acting as the good corporate citizen it claims to be and cleaning
up Bhopal," said Delcio Rodrigues, Greenpeace International
campaigner in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Charges dropped and apologies offered</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/charges-dropped-and-apologies/</url><text>
	Specialists and trained activists from the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal were brutally assaulted by the police last week when they entered the derelict Union Carbide factory site trying to contain a fraction of the tonnes of hazardous waste lying abandoned at the factory site. But now charges will be dropped and the brutal treatment acknowledged.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

            Bhopal activist Nity Jayaraman arrested  in Bhopal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digvijay Singh, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, has instructed his officers in the presence of an ICJB delegation to drop all charges against the activists. He also apologised for the unwarranted brutal treatment meted out to the survivors and their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashida Bi of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationary Karmachari Sangh believes the heavy handed police action suffered by the activists at the hands of the Bhopal police must never be repeated again. "We have already been robbed of our rights to live in a safe and healthy environment when disaster struck 18 years ago. At the very least, we expect the government to uphold our rights, and not compound our agonies by repressing even our right to demonstrate our grievances in a peaceful way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police also impounded the activists' equipment making it impossible for the international specialists to pursue their peaceful intentions of bringing the world's attention to the ongoing crime in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 18 years, the victims of Bhopal are not deterred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this the anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster, gas affected victims and their supporters led a huge rally through the streets of Bhopal. The people called upon Dow Chemical, the owners of Union Carbide, to assume all liabilities and responsibility for the Bhopal disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants are demanding that Dow Chemical takes immediate action to address the demands of the survivors, which include, economic rehabilitation, long term health care, clean drinking water and clean-up of the factory site. They also want Dow to face criminal liability charges as the owners of Union Carbide in the ongoing case pending in the Bhopal district court and ensure that prime accused Warren Anderson, former chairman of Union Carbide appears to face trial in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to take this campaign to the doorsteps of Dow wherever they may have offices worldwide until they accept full responsibility for this disaster. Dow cannot hide and it cannot forever evade its liabilities in Bhopal or elsewhere for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nic Clyde of Australia, one of the activists arrested last week, successfully delivered a 'Clean-up Kit' to Dow Chemical in Sydney this morning with a letter reiterating the demands of the ICJB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara Buakamsri, of Thailand another activist arrested last week, delivered contaminated soil and water from Bhopal to the Dow Chemical factory in Map Tha Put Industrial Estate, as part of the worldwide protest to challenge the world's biggest chemical company. He also handed a petition letter to Mr. James R Fitterling, Managing Director of Dow Chemical Thailand urging the company to show responsibility for the poison gas leak which has already killed 20,000 people and is still causing the death of at least one person per day from gas exposure related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

	Why would the owners of a 210 metre oil tanker try to elude activists, mislead journalists and try to sneak into the port of Rotterdam? Do they have something to hide?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/12/activists-deliever-oil-waste-f.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists deliever oil waste from the Prestige oil spill to Crown Resources, the owner of the oil that covered Spain's northern coast.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last day reports and rumours have speculated the route
of the single hulled oil tanker chartered by the same company
responsible for the oil spill off the coast of Spain. Most accounts
by the media quote the owners or the chartering company stating
that it would go to Antwerp. That the oil tanker has been besieged
by Greenpeace activists first in Estonia and then through the
straights of Denmark and Germany. The company wanted to avoid
further embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our activists have not been fooled by these misleading
reports and have caught up with the tanker in the port of
Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists approached from the open side of the ship, three
activists are now chained to the mooring line, two are chained to
the buoys. They brought with them a banner that is now hanging on
the side - OIL HAZARD - and they are getting ready to the paint a
message on the hull of the Byzantio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police have already arrived on the ground and a Greek
representative of the owner of the ship has been intensively trying
to convince our campaigner that the Byzantio is in top condition,
the best ship and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 26 year old Byzantio is a single hulled vessel, one of
hundreds worldwide. These ships pose a serious risk to the marine
environment. The ship was chartered by the Russian-owned trading
company 'Crown Resources' to transport 53,000 tonnes of oil between
Tallinn and Rotterdam. Crown Resources is the same company that
charted the Prestige oil tanker which recently broke up and sunk of
the coast of Spain spilling thousands of tonnes of oil into the
sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in Switzerland are also protesting outside of Crown
Resources bringing waste from the spill off Spain to their
headquarters and telling the company to: Clean up your mess
now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we stop the ongoing threat of oil shipments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union Ministers will meet tomorrow in Brussels to
discuss measures to improve maritime safety to reduce the risk of
accidents. But these measures may not be sufficient to prevent
another disaster. The EU Commission has published a list of 66
vessels that have been classified as highly dangerous, ironically,
neither the disastrous Prestige, nor the Byzantio appear on this
list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians must wake up and realise that tackling this mess
goes beyond mere suggestions. Now is the time for European
governments to take action and stop these old rust buckets from
causing more damage to the oceans. Now is the time for immediate
implementation of effective safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to see full and unlimited liability throughout the chain
of responsibilities, including the owners, managers and operators
of a vessel and of any charterers or owners of the cargo. The EU
must immediately ban the use of single hulled tankers and exclude
ecologically sensitive areas from shipping routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the only foolproof protection for our seas is to give up our
addiction on fossil fuels, end the cycle of pollution and switch to
clean, renewable energies such as solar and wind power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Byzantio has so far made it safely to Rotterdam, but where
will it go next? And for how long with the rust buket tankers that
follow it be safe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently two tankers in Tallinn, Estonia where the
Byzantio loaded up last week. The 22-year-old, Express and
21-year-old, Burgas are flying flags of convenience like the
Byzantio and have loaded the same dangerous cargo, 80,000 tonnes
and 50,000 tonnes of heavy oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another two are due to leave Baltic ports later this week from
Tallinn and Klaipeda, in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these tankers are bound for Asia than they will follow the
same route as the Prestige, past the oil coated coast of northern
Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Help us by taking action now to
support this action. Demand that the European Union tighten up the
loopholes and flag of convenience laws that allow deadly cargoes to
sail past our fragile coasts legally. Demand an end to the tragedy
of oil spills.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1037731467/index_html"&gt;Join
the discussion of the spill in Spain.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Take action online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a protest message to Crown Oil and demand that the EU
tighten up regulations on old, dangerous oil tankers. &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Click here to keep other ships in
port.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

urgent donation&lt;/a&gt; to our efforts to stop oil spills and move the

	What did we learn from the cold war, the disarmament movement of the last three decades, and the intricate history of arms control?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame reset-padding"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/160.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/160.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="hidden"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we should have learned is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development, production and use -- or threatened use -- of
nuclear weapons is a vicious cycle. Weapons of mass destruction
don't buy greater security. They don't bring stability. Mutually
Assured Destruction didn't end the cold war. The escalation of
nuclear arsenals stopped when the perception of hostility and
threat was diminished, buffered by a global perception of the moral
and political limitations of nuclear weapons as tools of
diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's especially important that we remember those lessons now, as
the world community ponders a war which is allegedly against
weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War on Iraq would bring enormous financial benefit to western
oil interests, and we remain convinced that US strategy is not only
about routing terrorism or stopping weapons of mass destruction but
also about dominating fossil fuel supplies.. But let's take, for
the moment, the argument on its own merit, that the US is going
after Iraq out of fear of the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, and particularly nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has opposed the development, production and use of
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction since its
inception more than 30 years ago. The testing and production of
nuclear weapons has already wreaked havoc on ecosystems and human
health; the use of nuclear weapons by accident or through conflict
could spell -- at best -- severely radioactive sacrifice zones with
many thousands of people affected, or at its worst -- the end of
our planet's ability to sustain life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that nuclear disarmament by all nations is a
fundamental prerequisite of a sustainable future for Earth in the
21st century. It is therefore imperative that the international
community - including the Bush Administration -tackle the question
of nuclear proliferation and nuclear disarmament in a coherent
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-scale attack on the nation of Iraq for seeking to acquire
nuclear weapons would be without precedent. The US did not threaten
to attack Israel, India or Pakistan for acquiring nuclear
weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three military strategies available to prevent
proliferation: counter-proliferation strikes, nuclear deterrence,
and military assault to create a "regime change". All are
flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military counter-proliferation -- the Israeli strike on Iraq's
Osirak reactor in 1981 is an example -- may deal temporarily with
the technical manifestations of proliferation,yet it raised the
very tensions which drive weapons programs in the first place.
They're also only as good as the intelligence they're based on. In
the case of Iraq, the IAEA dismantled a clandestine programme to
obtain nuclear weapons. If the US believes that the threat of a
military counter-proliferation response is an effective deterrent,
how can the US claim that Iraq has relaunched that clandestine
programme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nuclear deterrence was a viable strategy, it would be working
now. In Cold War logic, deterrence would dictate that Iraq -- or
any other state -- would be cowed by the overwhelming superiority
of the US nuclear arsenal and military machine. This clearly isn't
the case. For a regime facing destruction whether it uses a nuclear
weapon or not, even a single nuclear strike is easily rationalised
as legitimate self-defence, and an appropriate response against a
nuclear-armed aggressor. Can the US successfully disarm Iraq by
invading the country, taking over its infrastructure, and placing a
puppet regime in power? Possibly. Will a regime change bring peace
to the region and deter other states or agents from pursuing
weapons of mass destruction? Of course not. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Iran. It's a country with a chequered history of relations
with the US. It's politically inconvenient for the US to notice at
the moment that Iran is also moving swiftly toward nuclear
capability, just as it was politically inconvenient for the US to
note Saddam Hussein's use of biological weapons against his own
people in a different time. To Iran, the lesson of an invasion on
Iraq will be to ensure the swift development of its own weapons of
mass destruction, and to develop them while America is focused
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strategies will not succeed. A toolbox of responses is
required, but clearly the first and fundamental question is one of
leadership and political will. President Bush has said that the
real issue in Iraq is not the acceptance of UN weapons inspectors,
but verifiable disarmament. This is true. The problem is the
enormous inconsistency of such a statement coming from the
possessor of more then six thousand nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal non-proliferation regime has been undermined year
after year by the "official" nuclear weapon states, which by their
behaviour clearly show they believe nuclear weapons are necessary
for their security. The nuclear weapons states have effectively
thumbed their noses at the United Nations and international
agreements with an alacrity equal to that of Iraq's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and the other "official" nuclear weapon states have legal
obligations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. They should be
leading by example. Instead, the US Senate has refused to ratify
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Bush administration has
undermined the proposed verification protocol of the Biological
Weapons Convention. And arms control with Russia has devolved into
politically convenient bilateral deal-making rather than
transparent, legally binding and verifiable disarmament agreements
that actually destroy nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush Administration cannot reinforce the non-proliferation
norm by edict. It cannot act with any credible authority to
eliminate the weapons of mass destruction of others without
addressing its own. The case against these weapons must be a moral
one, not a strategically convenient one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, diplomacy. Pressure from other Arab states as well as
western countries is clearly important, particularly as a
contribution to a more effective and positive US Middle East
policy. Solving the Palestinian issue is a necessary prerequisite
for any movement by Israel to join negotiations on weapons of mass
destruction in the region. The US can play a key role in resolving
that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, containment followed by engagement. Continued pressure
on Iraq must include a comprehensive approach to the problem of the
proliferation of nuclear technology and know-how, particularly but
not exclusively from Russia. There must be a containment of the
feasibility of the weapons programme. But there must also be a
containment of the ambition behind it. Furthermore effective
measures need to be taken to stop the spread of weapons usable
material ,and technology, thus further reducing the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what we need is a new theory of deterrence when it
comes to nuclear weapons. At its root, deterrence is and always has
been a matter of perception: the perception of threat, imagined
response, and a close calculation of exactly what either of two
combatants believe they can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morality and what's deemed acceptable behaviour by states and
their leaders is also a perception, and one which changes over
time. As we move toward a globalisation of civil society, we need
to build a world-wide moral deterrence against the possession of
nuclear weapons. The cornerstone of any state's claim to moral
authority, and any leader's, must be based on their accountability
to civil society. They must abide by global agreements for the
global good, they must conform to the most global definitions of
acceptable behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of a state to exert its will upon the world
community should be measured in its demonstrable commitment to the
common benefit of that community. The authority of its leaders, at
home and abroad, must rest in a new, global and inclusive
definition of the public trust. That would mean nuclear weapon
states would commit to, and begin, the process of eliminating their
nuclear weapons in the certain knowledge that such weapons are
incompatible with sane and sustainable security policies from a
global perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any state thinking about acquiring nuclear weapons would have to
be deterred by the strength of global repugnance -- at both the
state and individual levels, to the acquisition of nuclear weapons.
Any leader driving a state in that direction must know that they
will face a credible worldwide outrage,untainted by hypocritical
inconsistencies, and with a moral authority that will be daunting
to their futures as leaders, domestically and abroad. This moral
outrage needs to be effectively backed by agreed obstacles and
sanctions that can be applied in an impartial and objective
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the Bush Administration is unenthusiastic
about the use of multilaterialism in general and the United Nations
in particular as tools for conflict resolution, preferring instead
to use its military power to ensure that its strategic objectives
are met. This is perhaps the biggest challenge for the
international community of the 21st century. We can no longer
afford to continue as a planet made up of self-interested nations
and national leaders. A world in peril needs world leaders,
accountable to the needs and moral imperatives of our common
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every inhabitant of Earth were a voter, what future would
nuclear weapons have in a global plebiscite on their
elimination?&lt;/p&gt;

            Two  barges transporting over 200 logs of illegal wood were impounded by IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency) after a three days blockade by 40 small river boats in the Jaraucu river.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- IF YOU UPDATE THIS FEATURE PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE LINK IN THE "Illegal logs seized after attack on peaceful protest in the Amazon" NEWS PIECE TITLED "FIRST HAND ACCOUNT".  THANKS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&gt;





&lt;p&gt;These dairies are from activists who are part of a Greenpeace
support team working with forest dwelling people in Pará state as
they strive to create the Verde Para Sempre (Forever Green)
extractive reserve. Half the size of Belgium, the reserve would
help end illegal logging, preserving the forest and the way of life
of those who live in harmony with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;24 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total outsider's perspective&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five days down the Rio Negro and Amazonas on the only blue and
orange riverboat out of Manaus. The Veloz, strung full of hammocks,
high tech equipment and towing the recently released and renamed
Anaconda (a nine meter inflatable jet boat formerly the Ocean
Raven).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of you know a lot of hard work goes into getting to this
stage as we set off down river and leave the relative security of
Manaus. There is an obvious acceptance by some of the more seasoned
veterans aboard that from here on you have a main objective, but
essentially it's adapt and survive. As far as a legal brief goes -
well what's the point! When the opposition are essentially the law
and blatantly disregarding it. No subtle spin doctors or public
relations work here, just a kick in the teeth and a bullet if you
push it. Sounds a little over dramatic maybe? Exactly what I would
have thought three weeks ago, but hey you live and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way down river there was a little work for the Anaconada,
a sandbank stranding with the Veloz, occasional use as a stern
thruster and regular pickups and deliveries en route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little nine metre boat has been trapped under a mountain of
Brazilian paperwork for the past three years and is now free and as
the only jet boat (to our knowledge) in the Amazon it represents
something special for the campaign. A bit of an edge in our favor
in a place where the words Greenpeace and international press means
nothing. It's an important tool and equally as important as a
little psychological booster. Never to be under estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five days down river we rendezvous with 50 local boats of
varying shapes and sizes, each one packed with local farmers,
fishermen, forest dwellers and their families. We will create a
blockade to stop illegal shipments of timber to the town of Porto
de Moz, which is timberville, the mayor being Mr. Lumber
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main aim of blocking the river will be achieved by a steel
cable with a line of small wooden boats moored along the cable and
an instant community springs to life. There is the school boat, the
party boat, the kitchen boat, you name it - a small community
strung out across the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most Greenpeace expeditions up or down river, medical
assistance is on offer to the locals and our onboard doctor was not
short of work. The first evening saw a 30 mile dash with the
Anaconda to Porto de Moz with a four month pregnant haemorrhaging
patient, first time I've seen a drip administered at 28 knots in
the dark, very impressive, hats off to all those doctors and medics
out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veloz, crewed by the most "up for it group" of locals, soon
became part of the action team, each one a prime candidate for
Greenpeace ships but me thinks they're far too sensible for
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day we restrung the cable, there was much talking
between local organisers and Greenpeace and a log barge stacked to
the rafters full of illegal timber. The barge was coaxed to the
river bank by the local boats and sat there for the best part of
seven hours being visited by local group leaders and
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture this... little river boats only 10 metres long packed
full of family members, kids, parents, grandparents etc. and at
0100 hrs the log barge decides to send it's 4000 tonnes at two to
three knots towards the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anaconda, various loose local boats and the Veloz helped pin
the barge to the shore just metres before the blockade. This whole
situation at night had a very large potential to become very ugly,
frustrated locals took their chance to hit back at the local mafia
and fighting broke out. Some key people, and who knows how much
good luck, stopped people from being killed that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very real situation out here and the word control is one
that you don't use lightly because it is easily taken from you by
the environment itself and by the corrupt system that's trying to
destroy the environment...no other words for it. I was scared,
scared for myself and for the little people at both ends of this
big argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we saw another logging barge and the arrival of the
federal police who are so ridiculously under-funded as to make them
ineffective. The agents were taken out to the barge prior to its
arrival at the blockade, again illegal timber, the confirmed owner
is the local mayor of Porto de Moz. It was stopped and helped
alongside the first log barge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day a planned trip into Port de Moz with the blockade
and two shipments was cancelled after an initial drop off of press
lead to violent assaults by the people of the logging town and one
activists needed to buy himself out of a very bad kicking, if not
worse (sorry he did not get a receipt), and the advice of the local
police, all six of them said people could die if we entered the
town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was good old plan B. Get out with no serious injury or
loss of life, having achieved the objective. This in itself was
another logistical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manaus and Porto de Moz are two different worlds. I think the
folks in the Manaus office have some commitment, but at the
blockade were people who are living in the lion's mouth and
prodding him with a stick because that's all they have. The
consequences? Well, some of them may not see the end of the end.
That's a fact and some high profile organisers will have to leave
the home they are fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing much changes in the fight between the haves and have
nots in this world, but this has been my most real experience of
this age old problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again over dramatic? Not from what I have seen. My most scary
experience, but more for the people we leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big hugs to all from a place where bullet resistant vests are
life jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I still know nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RP is an outboard engine mechanic in the Amazon to get the
Anaconda into shape after spending the last year in a customs
wharehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;23 September 2002,Santarem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are back in Santarém, in relative safety. But the last couple
of days have seen our worst-case scenario come true. What
happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the blockade a barge finally came down the
river, fully loaded with huge hardwood logs. So far only a few
houseboats full of workers have had to stop at the blockade, but
this was the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barge pushed on and the captain was warned of the blockade a
long way off, indeed he must have known anyway. But he pushed on
and entered the 500 metre safety zone without stopping the engines.
The threatening steel monster came dangerously close and only at
the very last moment we managed to push it into the river bank to
stop it from running over the houseboats. It turned out that the
captain and owner of the barge was the brother of the Mayor of
Porto de Moz and one of the largest loggers here. After some
negotiating between the leaders of the blockade and the captain, he
agreed to stay here until the end of the blockade. However, as it
turned out, that was not his real intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2 am the engines of the tugboat suddenly roared into
action and the barge started to move towards the chain of small
wooden boats tied onto a steel cable across the river. All alarms
roared and everybody was wide-awake. I had been dozing in my
hammock on the upper deck of the Veloz when things went wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the railing, I could see the barge in the gleaming white
light of the Veloz's spotlight making for the line of little boats.
Dave, our jet-boat driver, was already there pushing the 400 horse
power inflatable Anaconda against the bow of the barge trying to
stop the advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engines roared, shouts and screams cut through the night, lights
jumped through the darkness like lasers, a multitude of smaller
boats headed for the barge or circled around chaotically. Some of
the locals had already climbed on the barge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave managed to slow down the barge but was unable to stop it.
The barge was approaching the houseboats from were we could hear
shouts of panic as men, women and children tried to get their boats
loose from the cable. The Veloz came to Dave's aid and rammed the
barge from the side, pushing her into the bank again gaining some
more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a welcome surprise to us, as the Veloz is a rented ship
and the crew under no obligation to endanger either the ship or
themselves. But they are on the side of the communities and their
struggle and did not hesitate to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this moment to jump down from the deck onto the barge and
from there we hurried to the tugboat. The locals were furious as
they saw the captain heading his 4000 tonne barge right into their
families. They stormed the captain's cabin and fights between the
captain and his crew and the community people broke out in the
bridge. We few Greenpeace activists on board tried in vain to calm
the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the steering wheel of the tugboat was fiercely pulled and
pushed this way and that, the barge finally cut through the cable.
But all the efforts managed to buy enough time for the five small
wooden boats with more than 80 people on board in the path of the
barge to flee to safety. With the tugboat now totally out of
control, but the engine in neutral, Dave managed to stop the
advance and the barge was finally secured on the river bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a second confrontation took place out on the
river. When the cable broke all the small boats broke loose from
their line. The logger's lead boat used the confusion to get
through the blockade. It was followed by some of the larger
community boats and from the bridge of the tugboat I could watch
them trying to outmaneuver each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was spent in tight apprehension until
finally the federal police arrived and secured the barge and the
captain. Soon after, the Mayor of Porto the Moz and brother of the
arrested captain arrived, furious and uncompromising. His family is
one of the major players in local logging owning the two main saw
mills in the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials from IBAMA, the Brazilian Environment Agency, were
flown in with the Greenpeace plane from Santarém and confirmed that
all timber on board the barge was illegal and seized it. Meanwhile
a second barge came down the river, it was stopped by the police
and the timber also seized by IBAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mid-day it looked like the action was a complete success: two
barges full of illegal timber have been apprehended and seized by
the combined efforts of local communities, Greenpeace and the
federal police. And they both belonged to the family of the
Mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the more than 40 boats of the local people were moored
around the barges and the big Veloz overlooked the scene. We
planned to escort the two confiscated barges into Porto de Moz with
the full convoy of boats, once the IBAMA officials had ended their
work of measuring the timber on board. But once again the loggers
played their own unfair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the authorities had given their OK, the two captains
of the barges started their engines again and headed down the
river. The small police crew had to accept the fait-acompli and so
the whole flotilla of boats started too and we all accompanied the
barges towards Porto de Moz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the journalists went ahead in a Greenpeace speedboat to
catch a plane from Porto de Moz back to Belem and Sao Paulo. But
when they got to the town, the mayor had incited people into a mob
and they violently attacked the journalists and Greenpeace
activist. Only with police protection could they all leave the
airport safely, but even the police van was attacked, the doors
forced open, videotapes destroyed. The mayor also took part in the
violence. It was a close call, but eventually the journalists and
activists managed to escape to the river and headed back towards
our convoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They radioed ahead to warn us of the tense situation in town and
it was immediately decided to stop our convoy and not go ahead with
the barges. The barges of course continued, but we all stopped and
discussed our uncomfortable situation. Police arrived from Porto de
Moz shortly after the shaken journalists and activists, and warned
us, that if we continued into town, they could not guarantee our
safety and we could be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the boats from the various communities in the area
sailed home one by one. The journalists and the community leaders,
who feared for their lives, stayed on board the Veloz and we all
left via an alternative route. Later, we heard that one of the
community boats was seized by the mob and burned to ashes, one of
the men heavily beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are in Santarém from where the journalists can take their
flights. The news about the events have gone out to the whole
country, and Greenpeace is currently holding meetings with federal
police and IBAMA to discuss the situation. All of us here on board
have very mixed feelings as we leave the locals behind, some at
their own homes, some in secret places to guarantee their
safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lawless country, it seems, and the authorities are
unable to control the logging mafia. For the time being, we have
all escaped safely and there were "only" three injuries. But it is
clear that this campaign is a different ball game than any of the
other Greenpeace work that I have participated in so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another two days of sailing up the Amazonas back to
Manaus and these should be relaxing days again. But the images of
the violent events of the past days are in all our minds and have
changed the way we look at things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Santarém, 23 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are back in Santarém, in relative safety. But the last couple
of days have seen our worst-case scenario come true. What had
happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the blockade a barge finally came down the
river, fully loaded with huge hardwood trunks. So far only a few
houseboats full of workers have had to stop at the blockade, but
now this was the real thing. The barge was pushed on and the
captain was warned of the blockade a long way off, indeed he must
have known anyway. But he pushed on and had already entered the 500
m safety zone without stopping the engines. The threatening steel
monster came dangerously close and only at the very last moment we
managed to push it into the margin of the river to stop it from
actually running over the houseboats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the captain and owner was the brother of the
Mayor of Porto de Moz and one of the largest loggers here. After
some negotiating between the leaders of the blockade and the
captain, he agreed to stay here until the end of the blockade.
However, it turned out, this was not his real intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2 a.m. the engines of the tugboat suddenly roared into
gear and the barge started to move towards the string of boats tied
onto the steel cable across the river. All alarms roared and
everybody was wide-awake. I had been dozing in my hammock on the
upper deck of the Veloz when things went wild. From the railing, I
could see the barge in the white gleaming light of the Veloz's
spotlight making for the little boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave, our jet-boat driver, was already there pushing the 400 hp
Anaconda against the bow of the barge trying to stop her advance.
Engines roared, shouts and screams cut through the night, lights
jumped through the darkness like laser swords, a multitude of out
boarders and smaller boats headed for the barge or circled
chaotically around. Some of the locals had already climbed on the
barge. David had managed to slow down the barge but was unable to
actually stop her. And she was getting to the houseboats from were
we could hear shouts of panic as men, women and children tried to
get their boats loose from the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Veloz came to David's aid and rammed the barge from the
side, pushing her into the margin again, further gaining some time.
This was a welcome surprise to us, as the Veloz is a rented ship
and the crew under no obligation to endanger either the ship or
themselves. But they had all long sided with the communities and
their struggle and did not hesitate to help. I used this moment to
jump down from the deck onto the barge and from there we hurried to
the tugboat. The locals were furious as they saw the captain
heading his 4,000 tons barge right into their families. They
stormed the captain's cabin and fights between the captain and his
crew and the community people broke out in the bridge. We few
Greenpeace activists on board tried in vain to calm the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the steering wheel of the tugboat was fiercely pulled and
pushed this way and that the barge had finally cut through the
cable, but all the efforts had managed to buy enough time for the
five boats in direct line of the barge (with more than 80 people on
board) to flee into safety. With the tugboat now totally out of
control, but the engine in neutral, Dave managed to stop the
descent and the barge was finally secured on the margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime a second "sea battle" took place out on the
river itself. When the cable burst all boats obviously came free
and the logger's head boat used the confusion to get through the
blockade. She was followed by some of the stronger blockader's
boats and from the bridge of the tugboat I could watch them trying
to outmaneuver each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was spent in tight apprehension until
finally the federal police arrived and secured the barge and the
captain. Soon after, the Mayor of Porto the Moz and brother of the
arrested captain came too, furious and uncompromising. His family
is one of the major loggers and own the two main saw mills in the

all timber on board the barge was illegal and seized it. Meanwhile
a second barge came down the river, was stopped by the police and
the timber also seized by IBAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

managed to escape to the river and headed back towards the convoy.
They radioed ahead to warn us of the tense situation in town and it
was immediately decided to stop our convoy and not go in with the
barges. The log barges of course continued, but we all stopped and
discussed our uncomfortable situation. Police arrived from Porto de
Moz shortly after the shaken journalists and activists, and warned
us, that if we would continue into town, they could not guarantee
our safety and we could be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

Police and IBAMA to discuss the situation. All of us here on board
have very mixed feelings as we leave the locals behind, some at
their own huts, some in secret places to guarantee their safety.
This is a lawless country, it seems, and the authorities unable to
control the logging mafia. For the time being, we have all escaped
safely and all in all there were "only" three injuries. But it is
clear that this Greenpeace campaign is a different ball game than
any of the other Greenpeace work that I have participated in so
far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another two days of sailing up the Amazonas back to
Manaus and these should be relaxing days again. But the images of
the violent events of the past days are in all our minds and have
changed the way we look at things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Porto de Moz, 18 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past two days we picked up a number of
community-leaders and people from various little towns and
villages, who will form the essential part of the planned action.
The boat is anchored in the middle of the bright green Rio Jaraucu,
a tributary of the Xingu, and is now really full, with no quiet
corner left. Even the hammocks are so crowded that is seems like
being on a commercial passenger boat, third class. The campaigners
arrived as well, and so did the press team. This means that the
solar-powered office on board is also full, as everybody needs to
use the computers or the communications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Prainha, Pará, Brasilien, 16 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it was rather windy and the boat had to battle against the
waves as we slowly get closer to the sea. We stayed very close to
the southern shore most of the time, in order to avoid the worst.
But eventually we had to cross over to the north side, a crossing
which would take as much as an hour and is potentially dangerous if
we went parallel to the waves… the boat rolled heavily as the waves
hit us from the side. Just before darkness fell - and it is
certainly not advisable for these kind of boats to drive at night
when there are waves - we reached the little port of Prainha, not
much more than a cluster of houses, but some dating from the 18th
century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Santarém, Rio Tapajós, 15 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have reached the town of Santarém, which actually lies on the
Rio Tapajós, just off its confluence with the Amazonas. This river
is very green in color and where it meets the brown Amazonas you
get the same effect as in Manaus with the two rivers running side
by side for a long time before finally mingling into one. These
"meeting of the waters" are common throughout the Amazonas region,
where there are two distinctly different types of river: the "black
rivers" with dark and acidic but clear waters, and the "white
rivers" - muddy but far more noutrios waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dock in front of Santarém, the two churches of colonial
baroque style facing us, waiting to pick up some more people before
continuing our journey downriver. Time to rest, play dominos or
check on the equipment. We have come some 600 kilometers since
Manaus and are about halfway to our destination. Most of us on
board are Brazilians from Manaus or São Paulo, but we also have
activists from Scotland, New Zealand, Canada and Austria. Together
with the boats crew we are currently about 25 people on board and
so far everything is very relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tommy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Amazonas River, 13-14 September 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some hectic days of preparation we finally left the port
of Manaus, the metropolis in the heart of the Amazon, late on
Friday night and set off down the Rio Negro, on the banks of which
Manaus lies. But only around the first bend the Rio Negro meets the
Rio Solimões and together they form the actual Amazonas river. By
day this "meeting of the waters" is one of the major
tourist-attractions here, as the black and still waters of the Rio
Negro flow side by side with the yellowish and turbulent waters of
the Rio Solimões without mixing for many kilometers. Now, at night,
we only got a glimpse of the spectacle in the bright beam-light of
our ship, which the captain switches on now and then to look for
dangerous tree-trunks floating in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace boat for this particular expedition is a typical
regional river-boat, built of wood, with hardly any draft but two
decks. This enables the ship to navigate in even very shallow
water, but the price is the relative instability when it encounters
waves or a storm. This is our home and office and general base for
all activities for the next couple of weeks. She is 23 meters long,
six meters at its widest and we all sleep in hammocks strung on the
open upper deck. It's a lively picture with all the different
hammocks in bright colors. There is a constant breeze which makes
the equatorial heat of the day bearable, but at night it can
actually be a bit too cool. So we all have a light blanket with us
in the hammock, together with a pillow. With these accessories and
the knowledge how to properly lay in a hammock (diagonally!) they
are comfortable at night and inviting for a lazy snooze during the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our first days are indeed peaceful as we sail down the huge
Amazonas. This river is at times up to 20 kilometers wide, and
often it is hard to make out the shores. Countless side-branches
crisscross each other with islands and sand-banks in between,
making navigation a nightmare - unless, of course, you are a local
pilot like our long-time captain Flavio, and know the whole country
by heart. Then you don't need any technical help but just drive the
boat for days without once having to look at a chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second night we also pass by the village of Obidos,
where the Amazonas is at its narrowest: only 1600 meters wide. It
is also at its deepest here, at 100 meters the bottom of the river
is far lower than the Atlantic these waters will eventually reach.
Here we leave the Brasilian state of Amazônas and enter Pará,
timber-country!&lt;/p&gt;

	In the seaside town of Tallinn, Estonia, 20 Greenpeace activists prevented the next oil disaster from leaving port until port authorities arrested them and let the ship go.  Chained to the mooring lines of the rusting, 26-year old Maltese-flagged, Greek-owned tanker Byzantio were some of the same activists who last week were cleaning up after the Prestige oil spill in Spain.  They would rather have stopped this oil from leaving port than be cleaning it up on another beach.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/11/greenpeace-activists-stop-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/11/greenpeace-activists-stop-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists stop the single-hulled oil tanker 'Byzantio' in the port of Tallinn, Estonia, preventing it from leaving with its cargo of 50,000 tonnes of oil.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon learning of the ship's location and planned route,
Greenpeace scrambled to assemble an international team to stop the
ship within 48 hours. Hoping to keep the tanker from taking on oil,
the team raced against time to get equipment, inflatable boats, and
survival gear together for a possible extended conflict, with team
members assembling from offices across Europe. They arrived to find
the ship fully loaded with oil, 41 feet deep in the water, and with
its engines warming up for departure. They arrived in the nick of
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Byzantio is chartered by the same company that contracted
the ill-fated oil tanker Prestige that sank off the north-western
coast of Spain earlier this month. The French government has called
the ship a "floating dustbin" and demanded additional inspections
by the Estonian government. The Estonian inspectors found "no major
defects" according to press reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No MAJOR defects? That doesn't appear to have satisfied the
French government, who have ships on standby to escort any unsafe
tankers into French ports for additional inspections. Insanely,
ships like the Prestige and the Byzantio can pass safety
inspections and be deemed perfectly safe, due to the laxity and
loopholes of shipping regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The world has been able to see the unimaginable amount of
damage to the environment that oil tankers such as this cause to
the environment. It would be direct governmental negligence to
allow one more hazardous ship to leave port," said Pernilla
Svenberg of Greenpeace. "The Prestige catastrophe is clear proof of
the threat ships like the Byzantio are for the environment. With
the experience of the Prestige behind us, European governments must
ban these ships from our seas. We can't afford to wait 13 more
years."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 years is the UN's "accelerated" schedule for phasing out
single-hulled oil tankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many aging and unsafe oil tankers, the Byzantio is
registered under a flag of convenience - a place where regulations
are soft and inspectors are often willing to turn a blind eye to
irregularities. The Byzantio flies a Maltese flag. Recently, the
Paris Memorandum of Understanding, one of the world's leading port
inspection authorities, placed Malta on safety "black list" for its
failure to fulfil basic safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European ministers responsible for transportation, energy and
telecommunications are scheduled to meet in Brussels on December 6
and maritime safety and environmental issues are expected to be
high on the agenda. Denmark, the current seat of the EU Presidency,
is expected to present several initiatives to tackle the issue of
dangerous shipments. "This is a chance for European governments to
stop these hazardous shipments," concluded Svenberg. "They
shouldn't waste it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air disasters commonly lead to the grounding of similar planes
until safety checks and assurances can be made. Why should the
shipping industry be any different? The loss of life in the
Prestige disaster may not have been human, but it was devastating.
No unsafe tankers should be allowed to sail until the EU ministers
meet to review the regulations, tighten them up, and stop these
ships from sailing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And until Greenpeace is convinced that our elected officials are
going to make our seas safe from oil, we don't believe ships like
the Byzantio should be allowed to sail. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Help us by taking action now to
support this action. Demand that the European Union tighten up the
loopholes and flag of convenience laws that allow deadly cargoes to
sail past our fragile coasts legally. Demand an end to the tragedy
of oil spills.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Eighteen years is a long time to wait for anything. If you are waiting for the day your drinking water is free of poisons, a time when you have more than a few dollars compensation to help relieve the pain of chronic illnesses and an environment not littered  with toxic wastes, then it is an eternity. When the company responsible for 18 years of suffering is the world's richest chemical company there is a clear message - Dow clean up Bhopal now!
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Victims of the Bhopal disaster protest outside Dow's headquarters in Bombay.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors of the Bhopal disaster are definitely not ones to suffer in silence while Dow ignores its responsibility. Hundreds of women survivors marched today to the Indian headquarters of Dow and delivered polluted soil and water from around the abandoned factory with the traditional message of "Jhadoo Maro Dow Ko" or "Dow, clean up your mess".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women also carried 'Jhadoo' or tradional brooms (a feared symbol of Indian women's power) collected from across the country to symbolize the demand that Dow should clean up Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Champa Devi, who survived the Bhopal disaster and led the women in the procession, said: "We're delivering this toxic soil and water to Dow to urge the company to save thousands of lives in Bhopal by cleaning up the dangerous chemicals that have been dumped in Bhopal. Ever since the horrific night of the gas leak we, the people who survived, and our children, have been slowly poisoned by them. They've seeped into our water and have now been found in mother's milk. It's time Dow stopped killing us and put an end to our tragedy by cleaning up the site. Until it does, we cannot move on with our lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In India, the broom is a woman's symbol of power. Being struck by a jhadoo is the ultimate insult, and we feel that Dow deserves this treatment. By delivering jhadoos to Dow, we're telling the company to clean up its mess in Bhopal or be prepared to be swept off the planet," added Champa Devi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soil and ground water in and around the deserted Union Carbide pesticide factory is contaminated by hundreds of tonnes of hazardous waste. The company left the waste strewn around the site when it fled the city in 1984 after a gas leak at its Bhopal pesticide plant caused the world's worst industrial disaster, killing 20,000 people to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one person a day still dies from gas exposure related diseases and 150,000 are in urgent need of medical attention. Hundreds of families living near the site still routinely use the poisoned water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking over Union Carbide in 2001 Dow has only offered sympathetic words to the people suffering in Bhopal. Why is it so reluctant to spend a fraction of their huge profits to finally clean up Bhopal and close this dark chapter in the history of the chemical industry?&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning a group of 20 Greenpeace activists took over the facilities of a major Greek soybean import and processing company, Greek Oil Mills, to prevent genetically engineered (GE) products from entering the food chain.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Climbers drop a 200-square meter banner from the main building of the Greek Oil Mills plant to demand an end to imports of GM soy for food and animal feed.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists blocked the loading and unloading machinery, hung
a 200-square meter banner from the main building and took samples
all over the installation. Samples of soy flour, soybeans and
animal feed were then analysed on a field lab at the Greenpeace
ship MV Esperanza, anchored at the bay, and tested positive for
genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE products enter the European market through loopholes in the
existing legislation that do not require labelling of animal feed
and refined oils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek Oil Mills produces and sells mainly oil and animal feed it
imports through its own dock facing the Evoikos Bay, some 250 km
north of Athens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has served Greenpeace with a legal notice informing
that it intends to charge 2000 euros for each hour the factory
remains occupied, but the activists remain in place until Greek Oil
Mills commits to stop importing GE soy products and to provide the
food and animal feed markets with certified non-GE soya.&lt;/p&gt;

	One of humanity's most important staple foods, wheat, is being targeted by genetic engineers.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/wheat.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/wheat.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Wheat.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheat forms an important part of many people's diet around the
world. It has enormous economic, nutritional and cultural
significance. The commercial introduction of genetically engineered
(GE) wheat would have significant environmental and economical
consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The impact to farmers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of GE wheat would bring little or no benefit
for farmers, while it would cause significant ecological and
economical disruption. Industry's promises of increased yields,
decreased pesticide use and overall economic gains haven't
materialised in other GE crops, and it's unlikely that they will do
for this crop. Instead, many farmers growing already commercialised
Roundup Ready crops faced yield losses, increased costs from
problems with herbicide resistant weeds and became increasingly
dependent on toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Market rejections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major markets for US and Canadian wheat exports have already
expressed their rejection of GE wheat. According to Canadian Wheat
Board (CWB) estimates, customers representing two-thirds of
Canada's wheat market do not wish to purchase or receive any GE
wheat. If commercialised, 100% segregation of GE wheat will be
impossible to achieve in practise, making contamination during
transport and handling inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Monsanto is hedging on when the GE wheat will be
marketed, it's herbicide resistant Roundup Ready wheat seems to be
closest to commercialisation in the USA and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;The end of natural wheat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the environmental threat of increased use of toxic
herbicides, the gene flow to wild related species, non-GE wheat or
unrelated organisms, secondary impacts on biodiversity as a result
of altered management practices and impacts on non-target
organisms, are of serious concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because wheat is grown on such a vast scale globally, any
adverse impacts could be enormous. Thus, the environmental release
and the commercial production of GE wheat for food should be
prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

	The pressure placed on developing nations to repay foreign debt often leads to ruinous resource exploitation. Some tropical nations become host to vast shrimp farms, many funded by World Bank loans. This wetland destruction not only causes social and environmental ills, it also violates human rights set out under the UN. Greenpeace is highlighting the perverse role of the World Bank now at an international wetland convention.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists at the Ramsar conference hold banner reading 'World Bank: Stop mangrove destruction' to protest World Bank lending to the shrimp aquaculture industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ramsar Convention meeting in Valencia, Spain is the perfect
place to highlight the World Bank's role in wetland devastation.
Ramsar is an international agreement to conserve and promote the
wise use wetlands. Lamentably, some of the mangrove wetlands being
destroyed for conversion to World-Bank funded shrimp farms are
actually sites protected under Ramsar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Devastating delicacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivated shrimp, the devastating delicacy found on dinner
plates in Europe, Japan and the USA, is the primary cause of
mangrove and wetland destruction throughout the tropics. Fragile
and endangered, mangroves grow in saltwater wetlands along coastal
areas -- the saltwater equivalents of the rain forests. Hosting
ecosystems incredibly rich in biodiversity, mangrove forests are
one of the world's most productive types of ecosystem and form
important breeding grounds for fish and other water creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;From the mollusk to the manatee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangrove forest roots are bulldozed into the mud to make way for
intruding shrimp farms. Once mangroves are ripped out, the coast is
rendered unstable, triggering erosion, harming coral reefs and
seagrass beds, and eliminating habitat for creatures from the
humble mollusks up the chain of life to the meek manatee. Profuse
amounts of artificial feed, pesticides and chemical additives,
including chlorine, are poured in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Human rights violated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans from the World Bank and other lending institutions fuel
capital-intensive shrimp production. The World Bank's role in
shrimp farm funding directly counters that of Ramsar. The World
Bank has recently funded industrial shrimp aquaculture expansion at
sites in Belize and Honduras that include Ramsar protected
areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects funded by the World Bank also violate human rights
under the UN. Resolution 1989, Article 4 of the Human Rights
Commission to the UN states that payment of the external debt by
developing countries should not jeopardise human rights and
environment. But this is exactly what happens when the World Bank
funds shrimp aquaculture projects that destroy mangrove forests
vital for sustaining local communities in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Activists unite at Ramsar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Too many wetlands are being lost to this ongoing disregard by
both the World&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank and the shrimp aquaculture industry," said Lider Gongora of
Red Manglar, an environmental group striving to preserve mangroves.
The Mangrove Action Project, PREPARE and other visiting activist
groups also joined Greenpeace to protest the World Bank's role in
mangrove destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Greenpeace activists unfurled a giant banner which read
"World Bank: Stop Mangrove Destruction". Greenpeace and the other
activist groups united in a call for Ramsar to study the impacts of
shrimp aquaculture, and told Ramsar to demand an end to funding of
industrial shrimp aquaculture by the World Bank and other
multilateral lenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is working with local activists in farmed shrimp
producing counties and at the United Nations to prevent further
damage by shrimp farming.&lt;/p&gt;

	They're hoping you won't notice, but a decision that could open Europe to the Trojan horse of genetic contamination is being quietly rushed through the European Union (EU).
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Corn grenade: the winning image from the Greenpeace Seeds of Trouble competition
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal, under the Standing Committee on Seeds, would allow
0.3 to 0.7 percent GMO (genetically modified organism)
contamination of seeds, depending on the crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers may sound small, but they would permit the release
of seven billion GE (genetically engineered) maize and rape plants
every year, enough to fill 45 thousand football fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contamination would in fact be spread out over almost eight
million hectares of European farmland, unmonitored and unidentified
by the farmers growing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial vote on the proposed directives could take place in
early November. But why is this issue of high public importance
being decided by a small technical committee of agricultural
bureaucrats behind closed doors? Why have European Parliament
requests to involve elected MEPs in the decision-making been
ignored?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer: because these new seed thresholds are at the request
of Monsanto and the GE giants who cannot openly sell GE crops in
Europe, and want to sneak them in instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once allowed in, such pollution would be all but impossible to
breed out again. Pure seed lines of conventional crops could be
polluted in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You just sort of surrender," said Don Westfall, pro-GE crop
vice president of Promar International, a major US food industry
consultancy. He also stated to a Canadian Newspaper that "the hope
of the industry is that over time the market is so flooded that
there's nothing you can do about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But surrender is not an option. Zero tolerance is the only
correct attitude toward the potential consequences of GE pollution
of conventional seeds, a message the EU is now hearing loud and
clear from &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=seeds&amp;amp;s=blue2"&gt;Greenpeace
cyberactivists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why legislate "zero tolerance" for GE pollution? Too little is
known about GE crops to be sure that they are safe for humans,
animals or the environment. There is already serious concern about
their role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, and the
creation of super weeds, just two of many potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed directives also spell economic disaster for organic
farmers. Organic production does not accept GE contamination of
crops. Europe's organic farmers could be forced to give up either
their principles or their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn't guess it from the new directive, but ample supplies
of seeds with no detectable GE pollution exist (the lower threshold
of pollution detectable by current tests is 0.1 percent
contamination). With so much unpolluted seed available, it is pure
folly for the EU to set this artificially high threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU agriculture ministers must refuse the bad seeds. They must
instruct their officials not to allow any detectable contamination
of seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

	Zambian president Levy Mwananwasa's rejection this month of US food aid shocked the world. With child malnutrition soaring to 59 percent in his drought-stricken country, how dare he turn down this generous gift of maize?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/genetically-engineered-ciba-ge.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/genetically-engineered-ciba-ge.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Genetically engineered maize.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because the US donation was an ultimatum: "eat our
unwanted genetically engineered food or die." Perhaps because
Mwananwasa knows that the future of his country's agricultural
production is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does Greenpeace stand on this? According to the Bush
administration and industry propagandists, it is the
environmentalists who are holding a gun to the heads of the
starving. Not so. We say that as long as supplies of
non-genetically engineered grain exist, nobody should be forced to
eat genetically engineered (GE) grain against their will. If the
choice really was between GE grain and starvation then clearly any
food is the preferable option -- but that's a false and cynical
picture of the choice in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration has joined up with industry to paint a
picture of ghoulish green devils whose environmental principles are
insensitive to the needs of humanity. But is the US government
acting out of concern for the starving of Africa, or acting on
behalf of a multinational industry with a sales and image problem?
Genetically engineered organisms are not being forced upon Africa
because there is no choice. They're being forced on Africa because
the US can't sell them abroad, has an economic interest in reducing
its grain surplus, chooses to deny the existence of non-GE grain
supplies, and is developing a deep imperial disdain for the
opinions and laws of other countries which contradict their own
interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading5"&gt;Exploiting the hungry&lt;/p&gt;

The worldwide rejection of American GE crops has saddled the US
government with increasing surpluses of corn and soy. Since 1996,
the US has been subsidising exports by dumping these genetically
engineered surpluses into the UN World Food Programme (WFP).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFP policy helps smooth the way for the US because,
astonishingly, it isn't currently obligated to tell its 83
recipient nations whether their food aid contains genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) or ingredients derived from them. Yet
many poor nations have GMO bans, and they have clearly demanded
advance warning about genetically engineered imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disgracefully, hunger and desperation have become the Genetic
Engineering industry's best tools to penetrate the developing
world's food supply. They bet that starvation will overcome many
"developing" countries' resistance to genetically engineered food.
And not only will these people eat genetically engineered grain,
they will inevitably plant them, even if it violates their
country's regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the potential impacts of these artificial organisms on
human health cannot be dismissed, an even greater danger lies is
the contamination of natural species and the high likelihood of
unforeseen and potentially disastrous consequences on food supply.
"Safe zones" which remain GMO-free are prudent and profitable now.
They may someday be the only way back from a disastrous,
uncontrolled experiment gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading5"&gt;What's at stake for Zambia&lt;/p&gt;

Zambia made a brave choice to preserve their agricultural heritage
and its future. But their resistance to GMOs will prove futile if
the country and its neighbours find their conventional crops
polluted by genetically engineered organisms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of Mexico learned this lesson the hard way. They
too took a cautious approach and forbid the planting of genetically
engineered maize. But they did import such maize from the US for
food, and some of the grain distributed as food aid was illegally
planted by campesinos in need of seed. Researchers later discovered
that genes from the genetically engineered maize had crossed over
to conventional plants, contaminating Mexico's globally important
centre of diversity for maize. Centres of origin and centres of
diversity such as this are the genetic wells from which breeders
draw on old varieties to create new ones. They are places where the
natural genetic future of a crop is still unfolding - places where
we should not be writing experimental lines into unique copies of
the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africans fear genetic contamination because they can trade on
the GE-free value of their grain and organically-raised livestock.
Profitable EU markets could evaporate if the slightest GE
contamination rears its head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While starvation may be Southern Africa's greatest immediate
threat, GE foods are still an unknown quantity when it comes to
health safety. American consumers have served as unwitting guinea
pigs for years, but scientists are still debating how to adequately
test GE foods for safe human consumption or monitor for effects. No
long-term studies exist, and particularly none that consider the
weakened state of a malnourished population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research picture is even murkier when it comes to
understanding the effects of genetically engineered organisms on
animals and the environment. Already we have seen major ecological
threats from GE crops, with few if any studies appropriate to
Southern Africa's subtropical ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet over the next six months, GMO-laced US supplies will make up
at least half of World Food Programme food aid to thirteen million
Southern Africans facing severe food crisis. In addition to hunger
and AIDS epidemics, these stricken populations may someday add
environmental costs of genetic pollution and financial loss of
exports to their list of woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading5"&gt;The solutions&lt;/p&gt;

Starving people still deserve the dignity of choice. The US should
follow in the European Union's footsteps &lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/reports/ex-summary?item_id=40519&amp;amp;language_id=en"&gt;
(see table)&lt;/a&gt; and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid,
buying it locally if they wish. This practise can stimulate
developing economies and creates more robust food security. Ample
non-GE maize is now available and the Zambian government should be
permitted to use aid dollars to buy it. Imported food aid should be
only the last resort.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Africans truly have no other alternative, the controversial
GE maize should be milled so it can't be planted. It was this
condition that allowed Zambia's neighbours Zimbabwe and Malawi to
accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current storm of controversy, one wouldn't guess that
clear rules for moving GMOs around the planet already exist -rules
violated by the current traffic in GE food aid. Food aid
organisations must wake up to the Biosafety Protocol, the UN treaty
that obligates signing nations to assess the impact of these crops
before they import them. On top of that, the parties to the London
Convention on Food Aid have consistently noted that it is
preferable to provide monetary resources, rather than aid-in-kind,
to support regional buying of appropriate foodstuffs. These are
options that must be provided to the southern African governments
in this time of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Zambia's president had the audacity to suggest that
he wasn't going to trade away his country's agricultural integrity
to the GE industry unnecessarily, pro-GMO interests have launched a
vigorous propaganda war. Their target is anyone who suggests that
genetically engineered organisms have no place in food aid. Their
accusation? That the fears of environmental campaigners about
genetic engineering are resulting in starving people in Africa
going hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a lie and part of a consistent strategy to convince the
world that genetic engineering is the answer to the world's hunger
problems. It's not. World Hunger is simply being used as the answer
to the Genetic Engineering industry's image and marketing problems.
Real solutions to hunger are being developed and practiced
sustainably by small farmers all over the world as &lt;a href="http://www.farmingsolutions.org/"&gt;Greenpeace and Oxfam's
Farming Solutions website&lt;/a&gt; shows. The real victims of the GE
industry's PR strategy are the very people whose interests they
pretend to have at heart - the worlds most vulnerable people who
are being abused to market an unwanted and dangerous
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

	After only three days, the river blockade mounted by local communities in the Amazon has stopped two illegal logging barges carrying over 200 logs. The barges have been impounded and the owner fined almost 200,000 Brazilian Reals - nearly US$ 60,000.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/two-barges-transporting-over.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Two  barges transporting over 200 illegal logs were impounded by IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency) after a three days blockade by 40 small river boats in the Jaraucu river.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The communities' successful protest supported by Greenpeace
activists on the ground is the first of its kind in almost 20 years
as the people that depend on the forest for their livelihood stand
up against forest destruction and demand the creation of an
extractive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extractive reserves are protected areas designated for
conservation and sustainable use of the areas' natural resources by
the people who live in the area. The three-day protest was inspired
by Chico Mendes, a world-renowned activist, who was murdered 14
years ago trying to protect the Amazon rainforest. His model of
protest, known as empates or physical blockades of forest areas,
was widely used in the 1980's. Chico Mendes also developed the
model for extractive reserves in the 80s with other traditional
forest dwellers and the National Council of Rubber Tappers and was
later adopted by the Brazilian federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time a blockade of this type has been carried
out since he died. The communities' goal is to create Verde Para
Sempre (Forever Green), the largest extractive reserve in the
world, which would help stop forest destruction and promote the
sustainable use of natural resources. The proposed area is 1.3
million hectares, almost half the size of Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 40 small riverboats anchored across the 100-meter wide
Jaraucu river - the main channel for the transport of illegal
timber in the region this time of year. The blockade saw this first
transport over the weekend as metal barge carrying 113 illegally
harvested logs was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skipper of the tugboat, André Campos, is the brother of the
Mayor of Porto de Moz, a small town at the mouth of the Xingu
river. The barge tried to ram the blockade at high speed. A
Greenpeace inflatable boat was able to deflect the barge into the
riverbank, saving five small boats from destruction, and 86 local
people, mostly children and elderly people, from serious injury or
death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barge crew reacted violently and three people were injured.
Protesters from Greenpeace and a journalist from the Brazilian TV
network Record, also had to be rescued from the local airport at
Porto de Moz by police after coming under threat from the logging
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibama (the Brazilian Environmental Agency) agents seized the
illegal logs on board the first barge and then later, together with
Greenpeace and community members, impounded a second barge with 90
illegal logs onboard, also owned by a member of the Campos
family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulo Adario, Greenpeace Amazon Campaign Coordinator, is on the
scene and describes the area as no man's land. "It's criminal that
officials who are entrusted with public safety, like the Mayor of
Porto de Moz, instead protect only their commercial interests,
while the people of the region live in fear as their environment is
destroyed. Eighty percent of the worlds' ancient forests are
already destroyed, and the very people who could preserve the
remainder are subjected to intimidation and violence."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Japanese and Norwegian whaling fleets have returned from their summer hunt in the north bringing their total catch this year to 1268 whales, more than any year since the commercial whaling ban was widely taken up. But there is also good news. The endangered status of three  whale species has been officially recognised.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Nisshin Maru, one of the Japanese catcher vessels, transferring a Minke whale to the factory ship in the Southern ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling fleet returned to port this week after a
three month hunt in the North Pacific ocean catching 100 Minke
whales, 50 Bryde's whales, 39 endangered Sei whales and five Sperm
whales, a total of 194 whales, in addition to the 440 Minke whales
caught in the Southern ocean earlier this year. This is the first
time in more than 25 years that Sei whales have been hunted. Sei
whales were heavily exploited during the last century and are now
classified as an endangered species by the Convention for Migratory
Species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian fleet has also returned from whaling in the North
Atlantic ocean with a catch of 634 Minke whales. Together the
Japanese and Norwegian catch is the largest annual catch since 1988
when most whaling under objection to the moratorium ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the Japanese whaling fleet celebrated the return of
their catcher vessel the Nisshin-maru at a small ceremony in its
home port of Kushiro, Japan, countries meeting in Germany over the
Convention for Migratory Species (CMS) agreed by consensus to list
seven whales species as endangered or needing conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMS, which conserves migratory species over the whole of
their range, brings conservation benefits for whales making it
easier to develop a coordinated approach to the conservation of
these highly migratory species wherever they go and provide a
framework for the development of future regional agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fin, Sei and Sperm whales received an Appendix 1 listing,
recognising them as endangered. They join the Blue, Humpback,
Bowhead, Southern Right and Northern Right whales which are already
on the list. Minke, Bryde's, Pygmy Right and Orca whales received
Appendix 2 listings, recognising that their conservation status
would significantly benefit from international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway, which hunts whales commercially, recorded a formal
reservation to the decision but did not insist on a vote. Japan,
the world's largest whaling country, is not a member of Convention
for Migratory Species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listing of these whale species by the CMS recognises that
the status of many populations is uncertain and the fact that whale
populations are now threatened by a bewildering array of
environmental threats including climate change and toxic pollution.
For example, new surveys indicate that the numbers of Minke whales
in the Antarctic have more than halved since the previous survey in
1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the endangered listing of some whales, the Japanese
and Norwegian governments will continue their whaling programs
unless they begin to feel the heat of international pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 15 years, the Fisheries Agency of Japan has
subsidised the hunt for whales through a private organisation set
up by Japan's whaling industry under the guise of "scientific
research".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploiting a loophole in the rules of the International Whaling
Commission that allows countries to issue permits to kill whales
for lethal research, the whale meat from this 'research' ends up
for sale on the domestic market at a value of about four billion
yen each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hunt has nothing to do with science, it is all about making
money. Last summer's hunt in the North Pacific concentrated on
filling the Bryde's whale quota, the species with the highest
commercial value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But trade in whale products would make the industry even more
lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments will meeting Chile in November for the Conventional
of International Trade in Endangered Species and the Japan
government is using this as another opportunity to attempt to open
up trade in whale products. The Japanese government is proposing to
downlist northern Minke and Bryde's whales which are currently on
Appendix 1 prohibiting international trade in these species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the site in the coming month to find out what you can do
to stop the downlisting and prevent the trade in endangered whale
species.&lt;/p&gt;

	In public NATO speaks soothingly of disarmament and non-proliferation. But there is another face to NATO we don't often see, the warlike one of a well-armed nuclear force. In the firm grasp of the US, this shadowy face is being tilted toward a policy of nuclear first-strike. Will NATO leaders meeting now in Prague usher in darker and more dangerous days by adopting a new aggressive US stance?
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Police remove Greenpeace 'Stop Star Wars' banner from Danish foreign ministry. Danish participation is strategic for US Star Wars plans.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Hawks in doves' clothing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They speak the peaceful words of the post-Cold War era. NATO
member states say they are committed to the international nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament regime. And NATO has reduced the
types and numbers of its sub-strategic nuclear forces over Europe
since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they don't say is that the vast majority of those
eliminated were out of date, unsafe and militarily useless. Others
eliminated, such as Cruise and Pershing were deemed politically and
publicly unacceptable by many European countries even during the
Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately NATO remains politically and symbolically
committed to nuclear weapons, and Europe's turf still bristles with
them. Seven European NATO members (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Turkey and the UK) currently have an estimated 150
US air-launched nuclear bombs based on their territories. The NATO
nuclear weapons states (USA, France and the UK) posses a combined
force of over ten thousand nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Grim tango of risk takes new twist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the tensions of the Cold War over, surely we are moving
away from the risk of &lt;i&gt;actually using&lt;/i&gt; nuclear weapons, right?
Wrong. The US Bush administration seems bent on reviving the
spectre of nuclear war so vivid in the Reagan era -- but with a new
twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year marked a frightening new shift in why and how US
nuclear forces could be used. Previously the US described nuclear
weapons as purely "defensive weapon[s] of last resort". But in the
2002 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), they have been named as
'offensive' weapons that could be used pre-emptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Mission impossible: hitting a bullet with a bullet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major cornerstone of the NPR is "Star Wars", the son of the
failed Reagan-era missile defence system. Likened by critics to
"hitting a bullet with a bullet" the system is unlikely to be truly
effective, but carries the massive price tag of an estimated $US 60
to 200 billion. The Star Wars program can only lead to a
re-ignition of the arms race and a return to the "Cold War".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Bombshell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no wonder the new US strategy of the NPR caused a storm
when it was leaked to the public in March this year. Whilst US
State Department officials have attempted to dismiss it by saying
it is not formally adopted policy, the US Department of Defense
report to the US president and congress describes the NPR as a
"blueprint".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new warlike stance is a direct strike on peace and
disarmament. It defies the policy agreed in 1995 by all five of the
world's nuclear weapons states. At that time, the policy was that
only nuclear weapons states or those in alliance with a nuclear
state risked nuclear attack from a nuclear weapons state. Under the
new US policy, any state could be attacked with nuclear
weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Will NATO clone US policy? Again?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, extracts from the NPR reveal that the US is seeking to
change NATO policy. NATO has a long history of marching obediently
in the military footsteps of the US. With President Bush's nuclear
doctrine shifting to an emphasis on first-use of nuclear weapons -
even in a conventional conflict or before a military conflict has
begun - NATO doctrine will be under pressure to do likewise. The
question is: will NATO governments publicly endorse the new US
nuclear policy? Or will there merely be a tacit acceptance of
it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, they should do neither. "In the post-Cold War era it is
time for NATO to seriously review its addiction to nuclear
weapons," said Greenpeace campaigner William Peden, "not to attempt
to find new justifications for their continued possession."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is also using the Prague summit to tell NATO it should
have its own version of Star Wars. They want NATO to begin
feasibility studies and to start developing a NATO-wide system. But
the immense drawbacks of the scientific and political fantasy that
is Star Wars remain. Bafflingly, those who voiced opposition in the
past appear to be warming to this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;NATO must go public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes to NATO policy would be decisions of huge
significance. They must therefore be publicly debated in all NATO
countries, and that includes debate in all parliaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, NATO leaders must reject the frightening new US
stance set down in its NPR because it is no basis for NATO policy.
NATO leaders must clearly pledge not to support a pre-emptive or
first-use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

	When the Pacific Pintail left the open sea and headed through the Walney channel this morning the ship was met by five members of the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla who had been lying in wait. The flotilla boats obeyed all maritime safety practices and orders from the harbour authorities, but still managed to sail within 50 yards (45.5m) of the Pacific Pintail carrying the first sea shipment of plutonium since the September 11th attacks.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Nuclear Free Seas Irish flotilla made up of  yachts and vessels from England, Wales and Ireland supported by the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contingent of the flotilla was made up of four boats
between 10 and 16 metres, and one small sailing dingy. The skippers
and crew came from a variety of backgrounds including a doctor, a
lawyer, a retired Irish Army Commandant and a member of the
European Parliament. These people took time away from their daily
lives to protest the Pintail's lethal cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the channel the flotilla boats sailed abreast of
the Pintail, which was surrounded by police boats. "We had 'Irish
Sea Nuclear Free' banners along our railings, and were flying 5x5
metre flags reading 'Stop Plutonium Transport'. It was an absolute
success," said one skipper Dr. Warren Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla did not turn back until the Pintail approached the
first set of locks, and needed manoeuvring room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1532/81f444b99b1241/archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/svrw_020917/group.jpg" alt="Swn y Mor." width="200" height="133" align="left"&gt;This
marks the final end of an 18,000-mile journey for the Pintail. It,
and its cargo of rejected plutonium MOX fuel, has been hounded at
every turn. Confronted by independent protest flotillas in the
Pacific ocean and Irish sea; by Greenpeace ships as it left Japan,
again rounding the tip of Africa and yesterday as it approached the
home stretch. It has been condemned by 80 countries world wide;
banned from their territorial waters and exclusive economic
zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's somehow fitting that in the last mile global opposition was
represented by a handful of individual seafarers, from a variety of
backgrounds, who stood up to the Pintail and would not let her come
to port unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;

	As the two British nuclear freighters, carrying their deadly cargo of plutonium entered the port of Barrow this morning, they were again met with peaceful protests from the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla. How can those responsible for this dangerous and unnecessary shipment ignore the global protest ignited by the one just ended and sanction more?

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            BNFL ship Pacific Pintail arrived this morning to port with its cargo of rejected plutonium fuel at the end of its voyage from Takahama, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second time in as many days, yachts from the Nuclear
Free Irish Sea Flotilla have protested the transport of nuclear
materials through the Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plutonium transport has earned the reputation as the
world's most controversial nuclear shipment. Over 80 governments
have condemned it, citing environmental, security and safety
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En route countries called for the transport not to enter their
200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a call which fell on deaf
ears. Even on the final leg of its journey, the BNFL transport was
less than 30 miles from the Irish coast when it encountered the
Irish Sea Flotilla yesterday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Pacific Pintail, carrying its cargo of rejected plutonium
mixed oxide (MOX), approached Barrow through the Walney Channel it
encountered a peaceful protest with a simple message - "Stop
Nuclear Transports". The boats involved in today's protest were
from the Republic of Ireland, Britain and the Isle of Man and were
there to represent the views of millions of people living along the
Irish Sea coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships were escorted through the Walney Channel by a large
police launch, seven police inflatables and at least one security
helicopter. The yachts from the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla
fell into formation behind the Pacific Pintail once the nuclear
freighter carrying the cask of rejected plutonium MOX had passed
them between Peel Island and Roa Island at the entrance to the
Channel. The yachts got within 200 metres of the first set of lock
gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Flotilla is a partnership of individual seafarers who use
the Irish Sea," said Dr Warren Scott skipper of the yacht Swn y Mor
from Glasson Dock. "We wish to let BNFL and the UK and Japanese
Governments know that we are no longer willing to sit back and
allow the Irish Sea, or any sea, to be used as a nuclear
highway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Ireland which normally has good relations with
the UK, has begun a legal challenge against the reprocessing
operations at Sellafield through the United Nations International
Tribunal on the Law of the Sea and has also instigated arbitration
through the Oslo Paris Convention (OSPAR), a treaty dealing with
the prevention of pollution in the north east Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This plutonium shipment has reached pariah status. BNFL and the
UK Government have once again put at risk the environment and
security of millions of people around the planet for what? A
bankrupt business that will drain billions from the UK taxpayer
over the coming decades while continuing to increase its mountain
of stocks of weapons-usable plutonium. This was a wholly
unjustified and shameful transport and it must be the last," said
John Bowler of Greenpeace, in Barrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casks of faulty plutonium will complete their journey to
Sellafield by rail, where they should stay.&lt;/p&gt;

	The trade in toxic waste is outlawed in many countries. However this trade still continues away from the public gaze or under another name. We teamed up with internet activists to expose a common form of toxic waste trade.

            Ship being scrapped, Alang, Gujarat, India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, hundreds of ships are sent to scrap yards in Asia.
These ships contain large amounts of toxic waste like asbestos and
heavy metals. During scrapping these toxic substances pollute the
environment. Asbestos fibres fill the air, oil and other poisons
litter the once pristine beaches and pollute the sea around the
yards. The working conditions in these shipbreaking yards are
appalling, often with inadequate or non existent safety regulations
or protective clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working to ensure that ship owners in the developed world
clean ships before being sent for scrapping, rather than dumping
toxic ships in Asia. Shipowners sell old ships for millions of
dollars. Part of this huge profit should be used to ensure toxic
chemicals are removed and not left to endanger the lives of workers
and the environment in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pressure the shipping industry into cleaning up its act we
created a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and
asked for help from concerned people involved in shipping. We are
receiving several useful tips a week and one has lead to the case
of the 'Gerd'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our sources &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news18.asp"&gt;this
ship&lt;/a&gt; is heading for scrapping in Asia, it has been sold and
renamed in recent months and owners have refused to provide a list
of the hazardous substances onboard. We will be tracking the Gerd
with help from tips through the website to see if it is heading for
scrapping in India or elsewhere in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'Gerd' is one of the top-50 ships highlighted on the
shipbreaking website. These vessels are likely to be scrapped soon
on Asian beaches. We have informed the ship owners that we will be
actively monitoring these ships and asking that ships be
decontaminated of all toxic substances like asbestos prior to
scrapping. By following the 'Gerd' to its final destination, we are
demonstrating that these ship owners intentionally endanger workers
and the environment by chasing big profits.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nuclear Free Irish Sea flotilla has caught up with BNFL's deadly cargo of weapons-usable plutonium in the Irish Sea. The dangerous and unnecessary cargo has been wandering the world's oceans for the past 75 days placing millions of lives and the marine environment at terrible risk.

            The Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla  peacefully protesting against BNFL shipment of plutonium..
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flotilla, comprising concerned seafarers from all corners of
the British Isles and the Republic of Ireland, left the port of
Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday morning to protest the ships'
passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear freighters were spotted mid-afternoon today between
Ireland and south west Wales and the protest was mounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, the nuclear freighters course through the Irish Sea
took them to within one mile of Irish territorial waters. The Irish
navy had sent a patrol boat and spotter plane to monitor the
shipment and to ensure it stayed away from their coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla protest was peaceful, with all of the sailboats
maintaining a safe distance from the heavily armed nuclear
freighters. Two hours before the protest the captain of the Rainbow
Warrior, via emergency radio channel 16, informed both nuclear
transport ships that the protest would be peaceful, and that there
would be no interference with the navigation of the vessels.
Neither the Pacific Pintail nor Pacific Teal responded, which is in
breach of maritime safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla numbers over twenty yachts, and
the Rainbow Warrior. Jim Corr, of Irish band 'The Corrs' is amongst
the crew. &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/news_svrw_020915a.html" onclick="popWin('news_svrw_020915a.html','dub_openboat',392,377); return false;" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Jim explaining his motivation for
joining the protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flotilla is part of a global movement to stop the nuclear
reprocessing industry from producing and trading in weapons-usable
plutonium. British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) and the French company
COGEMA which operate reprocessing plants, have amassed more than
150,000 kilograms of plutonium so far at their respective nuclear
sites. Both companies hope to secure plutonium MOX fuel contracts
with Japan. If successful it would mean as many 100 plutonium sea
shipments. However, Japan's nuclear program is in crisis with plans
to use plutonium MOX fuel frozen by its largest nuclear company,
Tokyo Electric. Opposition to the plutonium program in Japan has
grown significantly since the original falsification scandal in
1999 with the Government and utilities under pressure to abandon
their controversial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This plutonium MOX should never have been shipped to Japan in
the first place in 1999. If they had their way it would now be
loaded into a nuclear reactor increasing the risks of a
catastrophic nuclear accident, " said Shaun Burnie, Greenpeace
Nuclear Campaigner on board the Rainbow Warrior. "The people in
Japan know this and are committed to stopping any further business
with Japan. The UK Government which continues to support BNFL and
the trade in bomb-material needs to stop this madness before there
is a disaster." Burnie added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Japan on July 4th, over 80 Governments have
condemned this shipment citing environmental, security and safety
concerns. Protests along the transport route included a South
Pacific/Tasman Sea flotilla between New Zealand and Australia.
Governments along the route have demanded that the vessels not
enter their 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The two ships are
bound for Barrow-in-Furness, where their cargo of plutonium MOX
will be unloaded and transported to the nuclear complex at
Sellafield. BNFL has no intention to do anything with the plutonium
MOX other than to dump it along with the other 70- 80,000 kilograms
of plutonium currently in store at Sellafield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ships will be greeted by protests from other boats in
the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla, when it arrives at 9am Tuesday
morning in Barrow-in-Furness, BNFL' s homeport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help us ensure that this is the last such transport by
sending a &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf3&amp;amp;s=vf"&gt;protest
letter to UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	There have been no farm animal revolts yet, but one of Brazil’s top food producers and meat exporters is not taking any chances. Perdigão will eliminate genetically engineered ingredients from all its food products, including meat, and is taking additional steps to ensure its supplies of animal feed are not genetically contaminated.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This pig is happy, not because he  has the run of the barn yard, but because he is getting GE-free food. Pigs and humans can work together to fight genetic engineering.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we found GE soya in five products sold by
Perdigão. Although genetically engineered (GE) soya and maize are
not legally approved in Brazil, GE soya seeds are reportedly
smuggled in illegally from Argentina. Half of the soya grown in
Brazil is actually used within the country and the bulk of it goes
to animal feed used for poultry and pork products exported to
Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We repeatedly asked Perdigão to stop using GE ingredients in
food and in animal feed used for its poultry and pork products, and
after pressure by Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1029487198/index_html" target="_blank"&gt;cyberactivists&lt;/a&gt;, consumers and our campaigners,
they have agreed to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this commitment by Perdigão, Brazil strengthens its
position as the forerunner in the non-GE market by providing non-GE
meat for export as well. Earlier this year, another major Brazilian
food producer and meat exporter, Sadia, announced its commitment to
non-GE status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian food industry has clearly realised that they need
to seize this golden opportunity to provide for the rapidly
increasing non-GE market. It means that, even if GE crops were
approved, a large share of the crop production would remain non-
GE. This is great news for the vast majority of consumers, both in
Brazil and abroad, who want non-GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perdigão says the measures will be fully implemented by 1
December 2002. Within Brazil, both Sadia and Perdigão buy and use
millions of tonnes of soya and maize. Some of the grains are used
to produce food for the Brazilian market, but the major share is
used as animal feed for poultry and pork, an increasing share of
which gets exported to Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Brazil joins an increasing number of European food producers
who are responding to the demands of consumers by producing animal
products without using GE supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it isn't just the animals and consumers benefiting from this
shift. Brazilian companies stand to reap the rewards from the
market shift to non-GE animal products in Europe and the growing
share of the non-GE markets in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Brazilian government has so far failed to control GE
contamination, the food industry is enforcing extra measures to
secure non-GE supplies. Brazil is anticipated to further capitalise
on its market advantage of being the only one of the world's top
three soya producers not allowing GE crops. Non-GE policy makes
sense not only from environment and health reasons, but is economic
logic as well.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today here in Johannesburg, Greenpeace and The Body Shop presented 1,602,489 signatures to the Earth Summit in the form of an interactive mural calling upon delegates to agree to get clean, reliable, renewable energy into the hands of 2 billion of the world's poorest people by 2010.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I am African.  And here we are in Africa a continent where over 500 million people have no electricity to provide the basic energy services which electricity provides.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and The Body Shop teamed up about a year ago to
create theChoose Positive Energy Campaign, launched in January of
this year. Thedemand: that governments vastly expand renewable
energy for peopleacross the world - the industrialised governments
should expand theirrenewable energy supplies and all governments
should commit toproviding small-scale renewable solutions like
solar and wind power,small-scale hydro, and biomass, to the world's
poorest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cost of getting renewable energy to the world's
poorest 2billion people is estimated to be less than half of the
$500+ billionthat is likely to be invested over the next decade in
fossil fuel powerstations and infrastructure in poorer countries.
For just USD 1.4billion, clean renewable energy could be supplied
to 1 million schoolsand health care centres, serving some 600
million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people added their voices and signatures to
the call, either at the Choose Positive Energy website or on
petitions at Body Shop stores in 27 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mural will be a permanent fixture in a part of
centralJohannesburg identified with protests against Apartheid and
now anemerging multi-cultural artistic hub of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painted by a team of local community artists, the mural
incorporatesa selection of the 1.5 million signatures and allows
members of thepublic to add their own signatures - so it remains a
living statementof intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the music of Baaba Maal and the words of UK Environment
ministerMichael Meecher, people gathered in front of three huge
buildingsenigmatically sheathed in hessian coverings. Baaba Maal
led the entiregathering to the edges of the mural and once everyone
was assembled, heloosened the cloth. The striking art work
underneath represents thetransition from 'negative' fossil fuel
energy to cleaner 'positive'renewable/sustainable energy sources
and the represents that hopes andaspirations of millions of people
for a clean and sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"... It is not just the poorest who are suffering in their every
daylives in order to survive. The poorest are the ones who will
feel themajor impacts of the unfolding climate crisis being brought
on byglobal warming. This is not a catastrophe waiting to hit - it
isalready hitting - and it is going to get worse," said Baaba
Maal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Roddick, co-chair of The Body Shop said at the launch of
theinitiave in London last January: "The use of oil, coal and gas
fuelsare quite literally choking our world to death. It seems
madness tokeep using polluting fossil fuels when clean green
alternatives areavailable. We have a moral obligation to achieve
sustainable energy notjust for ourselves, but particularly for
those people in the developingworld, who are currently off-grid. We
have to take a stand. Renewableenergy sources offer us the best
chance we have to avoid a potentialclimate catastrophe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two billion people -- one-third of us on the planet -- have
noaccess to electricity for basic needs such as lighting or
cooking.Getting people the clean and reliable energy necessary for
essentialneeds such as clean water, health care facilities, heating
and lightingis one of the most pressing problems facing humanity
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The statistics are numbers but each number is a human life,"
said Baaba Maal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;Global warming, caused by burning
fossilfuels, threatens people's lives around the world. While the
world'spoorest people use only a fraction of the world's oil, coal
and gas,they are likely to suffer most from extreme weather events
such asfloods and storms if no action is taken. Rising sea levels
threaten toengulf entire countries in the Indian and Pacific
oceans. If we aregoing to stop the earth's climate spinning out of
control, most of theworld's reserves of fossil fuels such as coal,
oil and gas cannot beused for energy and must stay underground. We
must make the switch topositive energy at home and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Japanese nuclear safety scandal uncovered</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/japanese-nuclear-safety-scanda/</url><text>
	Japan's largest nuclear utility has announced that there has been a safety cover-up for decades at its nuclear power plants. This is a devastating blow to an already embattled nuclear industry with global implications.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/greenpeace-and-community-organ.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/greenpeace-and-community-organ.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            People the world over oppose nuclear power and scandals such as these show nuclear power cannot be trusted.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) announced that there had
been a failure dating back to the 1980's and through the 1990's to
conduct vital safety inspections at their nuclear reactors and that
results of tests had been deliberately falsified. The country's
nuclear program, as well as any future business prospects for the
two European plutonium companies - British Nuclear Fuels and Cogema
are now in serious doubt. Japan is the world's third largest
commercial nuclear power operator, with the largest construction
program for new reactors and plans to use thousands of kilograms of
plutonium in its reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate consequence of the news was the indefinite
postponement of plans by Tokyo Electric to introduce controversial
plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel into one of its reactors during
September this year. This was announced by TEPCO President Nobuya
Minami at an emergency press conference held in Tokyo last
night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement by TEPCO was made solely due to the efforts of
a former worker from the company that did the inspections, General
Electric International Inc. The 'whistleblower' informed the
Japanese Ministry for Trade, Industry and Economy (METI) in July
2000. METI has claimed in a statement that it has been
investigating the extent of the problem since then. However, this
is confirmation that the Japanese Government withheld vital nuclear
safety information for at least two years, while claiming their
reactors were safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems that has come to light is corrosion of the
reactor core shroud, but TEPCO did not inform the Japanese
Government for at least one year. The safety cover-up and
falsification goes beyond the core shroud and other vital
components in TEPCO's reactors. TEPCO was planning to load MOX into
one of its reactors later in September, defying opposition from
local citizens who feared it was not safe. It has emerged in the
last week that the reactor into which TEPCO was planning to load
MOX, has been found to have serious corrosion in a vital component
of the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan's nuclear industry and Government has been exposed once
again as ignoring fundamental safety problems at their nuclear
reactors - risking catastrophic accident and the lives of tens of
millions. This is only the start of the scandal. There is a lot
more to be revealed and the industry and Japanese Government safety
authorities will have to be forced to release all relevant
information. It is confirmation once again that the nuclear
industry is inherently dishonest and cannot be trusted. The
ramifications of this latest news will be felt around the world,"
said Kazue Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate postponement of TEPCO's plutonium program is a
further blow to the business prospects of British Nuclear Fuels and
Cogema, both were desperate to secure contracts with Japan.
Currently BNFL is shipping a cargo of rejected plutonium MOX fuel
from Japan after they lied to their largest Japanese client over
vital safety quality control data. The only reason BNFL is making
the shipment, and why the UK Government agreed to a compensation
package of over 100 million sterling to Japan, was on the basis of
Japan signing contracts for MOX with BNFL.&lt;/p&gt;

	While government delegates returned home from the failed Earth Summit, some of the dirty industry lobbyists that ensured that no action was taken by the Summit hot footed it to the World Petroleum Congress taking place in Rio de Janeiro. Yes, the same place where 10 years ago the first Earth Summit brought hope that finally the world was waking up to see the damage we are causing to the world's environment.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists hung a banner across the arms of the Christ statue on Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro to protest against the world leaders'  failure to secure the future of the planet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously they are very happy having prevented the summit from
agreeing any targets for clean green renewable energy. The oil
industry can continue to make billions of dollars of profit while
ignoring the growing devastation caused by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While oil industry fat cats are busy patting themselves on the
back, our activists were making clear that society will not allow
this dinosaur of an industry to continue business as usual letting
the planet burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil suggested 10 percent of the world's energy should come
fromclean renewable sources by 2010. This proposal was shot down in
flames by the 'axis of oil' lead by the US government and its
backers including ExxonMobil and other oil producing states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the huge disappointment with the failure of the
world's governments to save the planet, our activists hung a banner
stating "Rio+10 = 2nd Chance?" across the arms of the famous Christ
the Redeemer landmark in Rio. Ten years after the first Earth
Summit in Rio we are still no closer to preventing the destruction
of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the nuclear industry lobbyists must have had the smiles
wiped off their faces pretty quickly after returning to the news
from the UK. The recently privatized British Energy is facing
bankruptcy after losses of £500 million last year. Ironically the
UK government split this supposedly 'profitable' part of the
nuclear industry during privatization from the less economic sector
of the industry. BE's huge debts pale when compared to the £2
billion in losses last year of government owned British Nuclear
Fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new losses show that despite 50 years of huge government
subsidies the UK nuclear industry is not only unprofitable, but
requires massive cash injections of billions just to keep
going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists, and other protestors, will be showing the
widespread public opposition to this unsafe, polluting and
uneconomic industry in the coming weeks with a protest flotilla in
the Irish sea against a shipment of nuclear fuel. The shipment is
being returned to Sellafield reprocessing plant from Japan after
safety documents for the shipment were forged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With nuclear power in crisis and the effects of our reliance on
fossil fuels becoming undeniable, with more floods, storms and
droughts, it is surely time for the winds of change to usher in a
new clean green energy future for the world in the 21st century.
Governments and industry do not want to change so we need to make
it happen for the good of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

	Warren Anderson, former Union Carbide CEO at the time of the world's worst industrial disaster in Bhopal, India in 1984, has been found living a life of luxury in New York State.  He is wanted in India to face charges of culpable homicide over the deaths of 20,000 people since the disaster.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Warren Anderson at his door in Bridgehampton, Long Island, New York.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson has been hiding in the US since an explosion at his company's plant in Bhopal, India, caused the immediate deaths of thousands of people and has resulted in life long suffering for almost 120,000 survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paid Anderson a visit at his US home and handed him an arrest warrant. He was tracked down in a matter of weeks by a  UK newspaper. He has been facing charges of culpable homicide and an extradition order from the government of India for the past eleven years. He has never appeared in court to face charges for crimes in Bhopal or even to explain why his company did not apply the same safety standards at its plant in India that it operated at a sister plant in the US state of West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our campaigner in the US, Casey Harrell personally visited Mr. Anderson at his luxury home where he refused to comment on the disaster. "If a team of journalists and Greenpeace managed to track down India's most wanted man in a matter of days, how seriously have the US authorities tried to find him all these years? The US has reacted swiftly on curbing the financial corporate crimes of Enron and WorldCom, but has clearly not made much of an effort to find Anderson, responsible for the deaths of 20,000 people in India," said Casey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night of the disaster, when an explosion at Union Carbide's pesticide plant caused 40 tonnes of lethal gas to seep into the city of Bhopal, six safety measures designed to prevent a gas leak had either malfunctioned, were turned off or were otherwise inadequate. In addition, the safety siren, intended to alert the community should an incident occur at the plant, was turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Carbide responded to the disaster by paying survivors inadequate compensation and abandoning the plant, leaving tonnes of dangerous toxic chemicals strewn around the site and the people of Bhopal with a toxic legacy that is still causing injury today. In 2001, the company shed its name by merging with Dow Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling on both governments to act swiftly, Ganesh Nochur, of Greenpeace in India stated, "Now that Anderson's address is known, India must immediately and formally push for his arrest and extradition on charges of culpable homicide. In return, Greenpeace demands that the US honour this request, per the two nations' extradition agreement. Anderson and the rest of Union Carbide, now Dow Chemical, should take responsibility for their crimes in Bhopal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Africa activists from 15 countries highlighted pollution from a Dow manufacturing plant just a few kilometres from the site of the Earth Summit. While Dow does nothing to help the survivors of the Bhopal disaster it also continues to pollute the environment, with toxic and cancer causing chemicals, where it considers the pollution will not be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Earth Summit, Greenpeace together with other groups are urging governments to commit to laws on corporate responsibility in order to stop the widespread abuse of the environment and human rights by multinational corporations. However the same multinationals are out in force at the summit to try to ensure that there are no new rules just nice voluntary agreements where corporations can say how 'responsible' they are, but face no penalties if they fail to comply. Will voluntary measures will stop Dow polluting South Africa?&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A small step towards justice for Bhopal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/small-step-towards-justice-for/</url><text>
	Against many people's expectations a judge in Bhopal has rejected a request to lower the charges against corporate criminal Warren Anderson, former CEO of Union Carbide. Anderson is wanted in India to answer how the actions of Union Carbide contributed to the world's worst industrial disaster on the night of December 2/3rd 1984 when a toxic gas leak killed an estimated 20,000 people and left 120,000 people chronically ill.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Survivors display a poster calling for the extradition of Warren Anderson, former Chief Executive of Union Carbide, from the US.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson was the CEO of Union Carbide at the time of the disaster and despite being charged with culpable homicide in the Indian courts he chooses to evade justice, for the last 18 years, in the US. He has been absent from all court hearings on the matter of the criminal liability for the Bhopal gas disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge rejected the Indian Government's argument to reduce the charges to negligence which carries a much shorter sentence that the possible 20 years in jail Anderson could face if extradited to face charges in India. Ironically the judge rejected the plea because Anderson has not been present at any hearings and did not file the appeal himself. The Indian government is probably under pressure from the new owners of Union Carbide, Dow chemicals, and the US government to reduce the charges against Anderson because of the damage to Dow's image and the reputation of US corporations abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Ganesh Nochur has been following developments "This judgement is very welcome. The case is at an important stage and we want the court to enforce timely implementation of the pending arrest warrant. Eighteen years is too long and justice is overdue!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhopal is an ongoing disaster. One hundred twenty thousand people still face serious health problems and children born to survivors are also affected. The toxic chemicals abandoned in Bhopal by the chemical company have contaminated the groundwater that is used by thousands of people who live around the abandoned factory.&lt;/p&gt;

	As the official negotiations continue in the heart of Johannesburg, tension is building over the issue of access to decision makers. Many unofficial ambassadors have been sent here to voice real issues from communities around the world, yet they are excluded from the halls of discussion and the presence of decision makers. On the other hand, business interests seem to get red carpet treatment.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/these-women-are-here-as-part-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/these-women-are-here-as-part-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            'Unofficial' ambassadors have met at the Global Forum to talk about sustainable development, environmental degradation and poverty alleviation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the corporate lobby is overt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delegation from the United Kingdom contains Bill Alexander,
chief executive of Thames Water, Sir Robert Wilson, executive
chairman of mining company Rio Tinto, and Chris Fay, non-executive
director of the mining giant Anglo American. Even the landscape
reflects the muscle of money: Sandton city square at the heart of
the negotiations is completely reserved for displays from the
automobile industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No Logo" author Naomi Klein said "I feel something strongly
evil in Stanton: marketing it as the summit of poverty and making
it into a fortress that keeps poor people out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the Summit, the presence of business is twisting the
outcomes of the negotiations to ensure that corporates do not have
to account for their actions. A summit that puts corporate
interests first, and ignores the need for change will be worse than
no summit at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, business as usual for the fossil fuel industry is
fundamentally unsustainable. Greenpeace is urging Governments to
switch to using 'new renewable' energy - with a target of 10% of by
2010. New renewable energy is wind, solar, modern biomass,
geothermal, small hydropower and marine energy. It excludes large
hydropower dams and unqualified use of biomass like wood, dung, and
agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a voice for change, Greenpeace is considered by the UN as a
'Major Group' - despite the fact that our campaign budget for 2002
is dwarfed by the advertising budgets alone of most of the
multinationals represented here. Based in the elite suburb of
Sandton, Major Groups have better access than some to the halls of
debate. Elsewhere in the city, thousands of ambassadors
representing a vast range of issues have come together because they
feel the situation is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summit that doesn't recognize these voices is heading for
failure. You can't make decisions on behalf of people whose voices
you haven't heard.&lt;/p&gt;

	That night I was sleeping, we had no notion that any thing like this would happen. It was around the middle of the night. I woke up to the pungent smell of irritation of something like burning chilis. Everyone was coughing in the house, everyone had got up. We started asking each other, 'Who has burned chilis in the house?'
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rasheeda Bee, Bhopal survivor
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard a lot of noise outside, and then somebody opened the door. Then we got the gust of the poison wind. I told my people in my family that we must run, because everyone is running away. By which time we found out something has happened in the Union Carbide factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eyes were inflamed, so we couldn't open them, so we were running blindly. My father and everybody else was frothing at the mouth. My sister also. We did not know what to do so we ran as far as we could. And then we just sat there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later when it was light, we took our father and sister to the hospital. They were there for three days. Then later, my father later died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happened we realized that we must come out of the house to do something about it. Many of us had never crossed the thresholds of our houses to go out. We came out. We formed our organization which is called the Bhopal Gas Affected Stationery Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are fighting not just for ourselves, but also so that Bhopal doesn't occur anywhere else in the world. One time, carrying children in our arms, we walked 700 kilometers to Delhi, the capital of the country, to present our demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are trying our best to improve our economic condition, through some activities, but it is so big, it is nearly impossible for us to do things on a meaningful scale. That is why we are asking Dow, which has inherited the liabilities of Union Carbide, to provide for long term medical care to three generations of Bhopal victims, and to provide them with economic remuneration.&lt;/p&gt;

	The start of the Earth Summit in South Africa, a comfortable residence somewhere in the US and a small Indian court house. One man connects all these things in a 18 year tale of disaster, death and corporate irresponsibility.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Protestors draw attention to the contrast between efforts to find Osama bin Laden and those to extradite Warren Anderson, former chief executive of Union Carbide. Anderson is evading justice in the United States and wanted for crimes in Bhopal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are head of a huge multinational chemical firm when your company decides to cut some safety corners at a pesticide plant in India. A few months later an explosion at the same plant results in the world's worst industrial disaster in Bhopal, India, causing the deaths of 20,000 people and making 120,000 people chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? Immediately send a disaster relief team to the area and disclose all the details of the deadly gas leak so survivors can be treated properly? Offer to fully compensate survivors for the horrendous damage to their eyes, throats, lungs and loss of entire families? At least you should clean up the polluted factory and allow residents to rebuild their lives without a toxic legacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name is Warren Anderson, former head of Union Carbide (now Dow Chemicals) the answer is a big fat no to all of the above questions. You let your company abandon the polluted factory site allowing it to poison Bhopal residents for 18 years. You do not disclose the composition of the poisonous gas so doctors can properly treat the 120,000 people who are still sick. Your lawyers ensure survivors only get between US$ 300-500 compensation each, if they are 'lucky', for their ruined lives, despite the fact you run a huge US corporation with assets in the billions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were Warrern Anderson, when you are charged with homicide by an Indian court, rather than offer abject apologies or sincere regret, you disappear into hiding, most likely in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasheeda Bee, a Bhopal survivor describes what happened to her. 'We heard a lot of noise outside, and then somebody opened the door. Then we got the gust of the poison wind. I told my people in my family that we must run, because everyone is running away. By which time we found out something has happened in the Union Carbide factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Our eyes were inflamed, so we couldn't open them, so we were running blindly. My father and everybody else was frothing at the mouth. My sister also. We did not know what to do so we ran as far as we could. And then we just sat there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Later, my father died of cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a climate where US corporate bosses are being paraded in handcuffs for cooking the books and costing investors big money, how hard have the US authorities tried to track down a man wanted to answer for the death of 20,000 people in India? It seems that as long as the corporate crime happens outside the US then it does not really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 26-27th the Government of India will attempt to lower the charge against Anderson to negligence, which means he will not have to stand trial in India. The crime has not changed, but maybe the US government and Union Carbide's new owners Dow Chemicals are working behind the scenes to pressure the Indian government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically Monday August 26 is also the start of the Earth Summit in South Africa where corporations, with the backing of administrations like the US, will argue that they can be trusted to look after the world and any government rules on the environment should be avoided at all costs. If Bhopal and its deadly legacy are any guide it seems the one thing we really need, to save the planet from more Bhopals, are proper government enforced international laws rather than voluntary corporate promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If recent events are anything to go by we can not even trust corporations to look after their money, something very dear to their hearts, never mind looking out for the global environment as well.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace found its way into a nuclear power plant in South Africa to kick of the Earth Summit and its call for clean, renewable energy for 2 billiion people within the next ten years.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/8/greenpeace-activists-from-five.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists from five countries today launched a pre-dawn protest at Koeberg, Africaís only nuclear power plant as world leaders gather in Johannesburg for the Earth Summit
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six activists from six counties tackled the nuclear facility at
Koeberg in the wee hours of dawn. Three men and three women hung a
sign that read "Nukes Out of Africa". But what were they there for
- what possesses any sane person to go on a climbing mission before
the sun has risen, and on a nuclear power plant at that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here to ensure that governments commit to bring cleaner,
sustainable, renewable energy to the world. This means that
northern industrial countries must expand targets for renewable
energy, substitute clean energy for their existing fossil fuels and
nuclear industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time there needs to be a massive expansion of
renewable energy to two billion of the worlds poorest people, who
currently have no access to modern energy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is necessary to tackle the twin evils of extreme poverty
and the global problem of climate change. We think that's worth
getting out of bed for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With less than two days until the Earth Summit, can the mighty
EnviroMen be stopped?&lt;/p&gt;

	Archbishop Desmond Tutu joined the call for a clean, nuclear free future from the deck of the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza today as the ship and crew continued their work in the run up to the Earth Summit next week.The Noble Peace Prize winner told the crew "Thank you for your work for peace and for a nuclear free world, it is wonderful and we thank you."

        &lt;p&gt;
            Archbishop Desmond Tutu blessed the Esperanza and the crew and then joined them in wishing for a clean, peaceful and nuclear free world.
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archbishop Desmond Tutu joined the call for a clean, nuclear
free future from the deck of the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza today
as the ship and crew continued their work in the run up to the
Earth Summit next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Archbishop made a private tour of the Esperanza, which has
recently returned from a four-day voyage into the Southernocean to
protest the passage of a deadly cargo of plutonium off South
Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Peace prizewinner told the crew "Thank you for your
work for peace and for a nuclear free world, it is wonderful and we
thank you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key demands that Greenpeace will put to all Heads of
State attending the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, is a requirement
that they should reject climate changing and dirty energy policies
- the fossil fuel and nuclear industries, and to address the energy
inequity suffered by the world's poor at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments at the Summit must make a commitment to divert the
annual $250 million subsidies from dirty power and invest in
sustainable energy systems such as solar, wind and wave technology,
which could bring electricity to the 2 billion people - one third
of the planet - who currently have access to none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One day, down the line people will say, why did it happen?"
said the Archbishop on the deck of the Esperanza. "It will be
because of the contribution of you and you," he added pointing to
the crewmembers. He then thanked them "for the people of today and
the people of tomorrow who are not yet born, but who, because of
what you are doing, will be able to live in a world that is
clean."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blessing from Archbishop Tutu was the first for the
Esperanza, the newest ship in the Greenpeace fleet. His visit
echoed a visit made to her sister ship, the Rainbow Warrior, by the
Dalai Lama during the first Earth Summit in Rio ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Archbishop spent nearly an hour on board and was presented
with a Greenpeace book documenting the 30-year history of the
international environmental group's protest in photos, and two
Greenpeace T-shirts bearing the logo "Choose Positive Energy" and
"Stop Plutonium Terror".&lt;/p&gt;

	When the Pacific Pintail left the open sea and headed through the Walney channel this morning the ship was met by five members of the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla who had been lying in wait. The flotilla boats obeyed all maritime safety practices and orders from the harbour authorities, but still managed to sail within 50 yards (45.5m) of the Pacific Pintail carrying the first sea shipment of plutonium since the September 11th attacks.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Nuclear Free Seas Irish flotilla made up of  yachts and vessels from England, Wales and Ireland supported by the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contingent of the flotilla was made up of four boats
between 10 and 16 metres, and one small sailing dingy. The skippers
and crew came from a variety of backgrounds including a doctor, a
lawyer, a retired Irish Army Commandant and a member of the
European Parliament. These people took time away from their daily
lives to protest the Pintail's lethal cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the channel the flotilla boats sailed abreast of
the Pintail, which was surrounded by police boats. "We had 'Irish
Sea Nuclear Free' banners along our railings, and were flying 5x5
metre flags reading 'Stop Plutonium Transport'. It was an absolute
success," said one skipper Dr. Warren Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla did not turn back until the Pintail approached the
first set of locks, and needed manoeuvring room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1532/81f444b99b1241/archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/svrw_020917/group.jpg" alt="Swn y Mor." width="200" height="133" align="left"&gt;This
marks the final end of an 18,000-mile journey for the Pintail. It,
and its cargo of rejected plutonium MOX fuel, has been hounded at
every turn. Confronted by independent protest flotillas in the
Pacific ocean and Irish sea; by Greenpeace ships as it left Japan,
again rounding the tip of Africa and yesterday as it approached the
home stretch. It has been condemned by 80 countries world wide;
banned from their territorial waters and exclusive economic
zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's somehow fitting that in the last mile global opposition was
represented by a handful of individual seafarers, from a variety of
backgrounds, who stood up to the Pintail and would not let her come
to port unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A solar powered haircut</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/a-solar-powered-haircut/</url><text>
	What does Greenpeace want from the Earth Summit?  To start with: clean, reliable, renewable energy for two billion of the world's poorest, who are today without electricity. And if anybody says renewables can't power anything practical today, we're going to give them a haircut.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/8/the-un-special-envoy-to-the-ea.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/8/the-un-special-envoy-to-the-ea.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The UN special envoy to the Earth Summit, Jan Pronk volunteers to conduct the first solar powered haircut of the Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace set out to prove that current renewables technology
can provide practical, clean-energy powered solutions for the
world. To do so we developed the Positive Energy Store, and are
showing it off all this week at the Earth Summit, where delegates
can get a cool drink, or shop at one of the five businesses set up
in the mobile unit: without a single wire plugged into the
electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us launch the project, the UN special envoy to the Earth
Summit, Jan Pronk volunteered to conduct the first solar powered
haircut of the summit. We have a number of appliances in the stall
running on renewable energy. He enjoyed a freshly created juice
from an electric juicer, before logging onto the internet using a
solar powered computer to sign the online petition. This petition
calls for the massive uptake of renewable energy by the
industrialized nations, and access to clean renewable energy for
two billion of the world's poorest people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Positive Energy Store powers small businesses in remote
rural areas with renewable energy. With solar panels, small wind
turbines and micro-hydro, the store can generate positive energy
for the five businesses that are inside. The concept is flexible so
that the Positive Energy Store can be adapted to the needs of the
area it will be placed in. The range of shops can vary, for
example, from a barber, a juice bar, a communication unit with
phone and computer services to a business that leases out charged
batteries to power peoples' homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the World Summit the Positive Energy Store will be tested
in a pilot project in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. During a period
of six months the store will be thoroughly monitored by five local
shopkeepers. Not only will the technical part of the store be
closely watched, the shopkeepers will also be provided with
training on how to operate the Positive Energy Store in a
sustainable and profitable way. The aim is that the entrepreneurs
of the shops will earn back the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need renewables?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we begin the 21st century, two billion people - one third of
us on the planet - have no access to electricity for basic needs
such as lighting or cooking. Getting people the clean and reliable
energy necessary for essential needs such as clean water, health
care facilities, heating and lighting is one of the most pressing
problems facing humanity today. Global warming, caused by burning
fossil fuels, threatens people's lives around the world. While the
world's poorest people use only a fraction of the world's oil, coal
and gas, they are likely to suffer most from the impacts of climate
change like extreme weather events such as floods and storms if no
action is taken. Rising sea levels threaten to engulf entire
countries in the Indian and Pacific oceans. If we are going to stop
the earth's climate spinning out of control, most of the world's
reserves of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas cannot be used
for energy and must stay underground. We must make the switch to
positive energy at home and globally. Oil, coal and gas cannot meet
the needs of the poorest, but 'positive' or renewable energy
can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy technologies are the most appropriate,
affordable, reliable and environmentally friendly way to get
essential energy services to poorer countries where 80 perecnt of
the world's people live. Energy is the lifeblood of modern society.
But, due to the global impact of current polluting energy supplies
such as oil, coal, gas and nuclear power, we are at a crossroads. A
clean energy future is now urgently needed. Renewable energy is
reliable, inexhaustible power generated by natural processes such
as wind, solar, biomass and small-scale hydro. The increased use of
renewable energy sources can improve the quality of life,
especially in developing countries. Without contributing to climate
change, it can provide an affordable and reliable means of getting
power to the world's poorest people. It can provide electricity for
basic needs such as refrigeration of medical supplies,
sterilisation, lighting and telecommunications as well as for
radios and water pumps. The total cost of getting renewable energy
to the world's poorest two billion people is estimated to be less
than half of the US$500+ billion that is likely to be invested over
the next decade in fossil fuel power stations and infrastructure in
poorer countries. For just US$1.4 billion, clean renewable energy
could be supplied to one million schools and health care centres,
serving some 600 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

	As the two British nuclear freighters, carrying their deadly cargo of plutonium entered the port of Barrow this morning, they were again met with peaceful protests from the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla. How can those responsible for this dangerous and unnecessary shipment ignore the global protest ignited by the one just ended and sanction more?
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            BNFL ship Pacific Pintail arrived this morning to port with its cargo of rejected plutonium fuel at the end of its voyage from Takahama, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second time in as many days, yachts from the Nuclear
Free Irish Sea Flotilla have protested the transport of nuclear
materials through the Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plutonium transport has earned the reputation as the
world's most controversial nuclear shipment. Over 80 governments
have condemned it, citing environmental, security and safety
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En route countries called for the transport not to enter their
200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a call which fell on deaf
ears. Even on the final leg of its journey, the BNFL transport was
less than 30 miles from the Irish coast when it encountered the
Irish Sea Flotilla yesterday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Pacific Pintail, carrying its cargo of rejected plutonium
mixed oxide (MOX), approached Barrow through the Walney Channel it
encountered a peaceful protest with a simple message - "Stop
Nuclear Transports". The boats involved in today's protest were
from the Republic of Ireland, Britain and the Isle of Man and were
there to represent the views of millions of people living along the
Irish Sea coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships were escorted through the Walney Channel by a large
police launch, seven police inflatables and at least one security
helicopter. The yachts from the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla
fell into formation behind the Pacific Pintail once the nuclear
freighter carrying the cask of rejected plutonium MOX had passed
them between Peel Island and Roa Island at the entrance to the
Channel. The yachts got within 200 metres of the first set of lock
gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Flotilla is a partnership of individual seafarers who use
the Irish Sea," said Dr Warren Scott skipper of the yacht Swn y Mor
from Glasson Dock. "We wish to let BNFL and the UK and Japanese
Governments know that we are no longer willing to sit back and
allow the Irish Sea, or any sea, to be used as a nuclear
highway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Ireland which normally has good relations with
the UK, has begun a legal challenge against the reprocessing
operations at Sellafield through the United Nations International
Tribunal on the Law of the Sea and has also instigated arbitration
through the Oslo Paris Convention (OSPAR), a treaty dealing with
the prevention of pollution in the north east Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This plutonium shipment has reached pariah status. BNFL and the
UK Government have once again put at risk the environment and
security of millions of people around the planet for what? A
bankrupt business that will drain billions from the UK taxpayer
over the coming decades while continuing to increase its mountain
of stocks of weapons-usable plutonium. This was a wholly
unjustified and shameful transport and it must be the last," said
John Bowler of Greenpeace, in Barrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casks of faulty plutonium will complete their journey to
Sellafield by rail, where they should stay.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two British freighters with their cargo of weapons-usable plutonium, are now in the home straight of an 18,000 mile transport of terror. As the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal near the Irish Sea on their journey from Japan to Barrow on England's north west coast, the full glare of the public spotlight is being prepared for their arrival.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            .THE NUCLEAR FREE IRISH SEA FLOTILLA, (MADE UP OF YACHTS AND VESSELS FROM ENGLAND , WALES AND IRELAND), SUPPORTED BY THE GREENPEACE SHIP SV RAINBOW WARRIOR
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flotilla of sailboats from Ireland and the British Isles and
our own Rainbow Warrior are in the Irish Sea to peacefully protest
against and to highlight the madness of the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freighters were spotted off the coast of Portugal a few days
ago and are expected to enter the Irish Sea by Monday 16th or
Tuesday 17th September. There is no information yet that the ship's
operators, BNFL, have notified the Irish Government, the Northern
Ireland Assembly, the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament
about the route the ships will now take. The nuclear shipment could
pass less than 10 miles from their coasts and population. The main
concerns are that the ships are vulnerable to catastrophic accident
or terrorist attack, which could lead to large-scale contamination
of the marine environment and coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Irish Government, backed by all opposition parties has
condemned the imminent arrival of the plutonium shipment. Following
meetings of its Emergencies Committee, the Government in Dublin
agreed to deploy naval vessels and aircraft to track the shipment
and to ensure that it did not enter Irish waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotlla, which the Rainbow Warrior is
supporting, comprises individuals whose love of the sea and
communities that it supports, has united them to take action to
protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL and the British Government should take note of the strength
of commitment of some of the people whose lives they risk with
their deadly shipments and radioactive discharges from the
Sellafield nuclear plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Barrett:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As mariners we constantly face the challenge of the seas and
nature. We survive the often dangerous conditions because we have
learnt to respect the might of the sea and pay due consideration to
the amazing natural amenity that we as sailors are honoured to sail
upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that respect not reciprocated by BNFL. How can they
continue to make the Irish Sea the most toxic sea on this
planet?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Doody:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The sea has been in my family for many years. These guys [BNFL
nuclear freighter crew] are also sailors but I guess it's hard to
approach them. I would ask them, though, how they could run this
cargo through oceans that they could destroy .. destroy something
that sailors for many centuries have enjoyed? - I don't
understand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek Harris:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prayer for the flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;".....that those who see us have a change of heart and realise
that with your power and our strength and commitment that, perhaps,
in the long term, we may be able to cause change in other
people."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/ship_crew.html"&gt;Photos
and sound bites from the skippers and route map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the expression of outrage at the end of this deadly
cargo's journey, added to the strong protests of 80 en-route
nations and other flotillas of concerned sailors, will ensure that
this is the last time our oceans and seas are used as nuclear
highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell UK Foreign Minister, Jack Straw, that we don't want any
more transports of terror and &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf3&amp;amp;s=vf"&gt;join our
virtual flotilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	There have been no farm animal revolts yet, but one of Brazil’s top food producers and meat exporters is not taking any chances. Perdigão will eliminate genetically engineered ingredients from all its food products, including meat, and is taking additional steps to ensure its supplies of animal feed are not genetically contaminated.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/this-pig-is-happy-not-because.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/9/this-pig-is-happy-not-because.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This pig is happy, not because he  has the run of the barn yard, but because he is getting GE-free food. Pigs and humans can work together to fight genetic engineering.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we found GE soya in five products sold by
Perdigão. Although genetically engineered (GE) soya and maize are
not legally approved in Brazil, GE soya seeds are reportedly
smuggled in illegally from Argentina. Half of the soya grown in
Brazil is actually used within the country and the bulk of it goes
to animal feed used for poultry and pork products exported to
Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We repeatedly asked Perdigão to stop using GE ingredients in
food and in animal feed used for its poultry and pork products, and
after pressure by Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/1029487198/index_html" target="_blank"&gt;cyberactivists&lt;/a&gt;, consumers and our campaigners,
they have agreed to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this commitment by Perdigão, Brazil strengthens its
position as the forerunner in the non-GE market by providing non-GE
meat for export as well. Earlier this year, another major Brazilian
food producer and meat exporter, Sadia, announced its commitment to
non-GE status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian food industry has clearly realised that they need
to seize this golden opportunity to provide for the rapidly
increasing non-GE market. It means that, even if GE crops were
approved, a large share of the crop production would remain non-
GE. This is great news for the vast majority of consumers, both in
Brazil and abroad, who want non-GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perdigão says the measures will be fully implemented by 1
December 2002. Within Brazil, both Sadia and Perdigão buy and use
millions of tonnes of soya and maize. Some of the grains are used
to produce food for the Brazilian market, but the major share is
used as animal feed for poultry and pork, an increasing share of
which gets exported to Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Brazil joins an increasing number of European food producers
who are responding to the demands of consumers by producing animal
products without using GE supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it isn't just the animals and consumers benefiting from this
shift. Brazilian companies stand to reap the rewards from the
market shift to non-GE animal products in Europe and the growing
share of the non-GE markets in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Brazilian government has so far failed to control GE
contamination, the food industry is enforcing extra measures to
secure non-GE supplies. Brazil is anticipated to further capitalise
on its market advantage of being the only one of the world's top
three soya producers not allowing GE crops. Non-GE policy makes
sense not only from environment and health reasons, but is economic
logic as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pariah Plutonium ships spotted off the coast of Portugal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/plutonium-ships-spotted/</url><text>
	A year on from the September 11th attacks and it seems some governments have learnt nothing about true global security. Two ships carrying weapons-useable plutonium are nearing the end of a journey half way around the world, through waters of discontent and past small ships bearing witness. As the ships near home they will face their strongest opposition and be welcomed back by a nuclear industry that is showing cracks from coverups, bankruptcies and insolvencies, safety lapses and failures in plant security.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The two ships chartered by BNFL, the Pintail and the Teal depart Barrow, UK for Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Pintail, carrying the cask of rejected plutonium
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, and her lightly armed escort, the Pacific
Teal are now global outcasts, having been condemned by 80
governments along its route from Japan since they left in July. The
ships are currently being escorted by a Portuguese naval vessel to
ensure they stay outside the Portuguese Exclusive Economic
Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two nuclear freighters were spotted west of the Portuguese
island of Madeira earlier today. Soon they will face a barrage of
protest from the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla as they near their
homeport of Barrow-in-Furness. Up to 18 yachts will sail out into
the Irish sea to peacefully protest against the freighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Barrett is skipper of the yacht Tuscair and a participant
of the flotilla. Paul says he is determined to peacefully protest
BNFL and the UK and Japanese governments for continually supporting
this morally and financially bankrupt industry. "This has given
myself and other members of the sailing community an opportunity
not only to express our own concerns, but also of those who live by
and near the Irish Sea," said Paul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), owners of the two nuclear ships,
is also facing tough times on land, their business in Japan is in
jeopardy - Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) has suspended its plutonium
MOX programme indefinitely. This shipment was justified by BNFL
solely on the basis of regaining business with Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more troubles at home. BNFL's single largest
reprocessing client, British Energy, is facing bankruptcy after
losses of £500 million last year. Ironically the UK government
split this supposedly 'profitable' part of the nuclear industry
during privatisation from the less economic sector of the industry.
British Energy's huge debts pale when compared to the £2 billion in
losses last year of government owned BNFL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the bottom drops out of the UK nuclear industry, the BNFL
ships with their deadly cargo pressed forward against the wishes of
governments and citizens. The ships were not welcome in any sea on
their disgraced journey back from Japan, and they are certainly not
welcome in the Irish sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty governments including Ireland have publicly decried this
shipment as lunacy. The UK and Japanese nuclear industries have
been exposed as dishonest, unsafe and uneconomic. Rather than
increasing the trade in bomb material with all the risks that
entails, they need to concentrate on waste clean-up and investments
in clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;

shipments by joining the virtual flotilla.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	While government delegates returned home from the failed Earth Summit, some of the dirty industry lobbyists that ensured that no action was taken by the Summit hot footed it to the World Petroleum Congress taking place in Rio de Janeiro. Yes, the same place where 10 years ago the first Earth Summit brought hope that finally the world was waking up to see the damage we are causing to the world's environment.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists hung a banner across the arms of the Christ statue on Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro to protest against the world leaders'  failure to secure the future of the planet.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously they are very happy having prevented the summit from
agreeing any targets for clean green renewable energy. The oil
industry can continue to make billions of dollars of profit while
ignoring the growing devastation caused by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While oil industry fat cats are busy patting themselves on the
back, our activists were making clear that society will not allow
this dinosaur of an industry to continue business as usual letting
the planet burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil suggested 10 percent of the world's energy should come
fromclean renewable sources by 2010. This proposal was shot down in
flames by the 'axis of oil' lead by the US government and its
backers including ExxonMobil and other oil producing states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the huge disappointment with the failure of the
world's governments to save the planet, our activists hung a banner
stating "Rio+10 = 2nd Chance?" across the arms of the famous Christ
the Redeemer landmark in Rio. Ten years after the first Earth
Summit in Rio we are still no closer to preventing the destruction
of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the nuclear industry lobbyists must have had the smiles
wiped off their faces pretty quickly after returning to the news
from the UK. The recently privatized British Energy is facing
bankruptcy after losses of £500 million last year. Ironically the
UK government split this supposedly 'profitable' part of the
nuclear industry during privatization from the less economic sector
of the industry. BE's huge debts pale when compared to the £2
billion in losses last year of government owned British Nuclear
Fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new losses show that despite 50 years of huge government
subsidies the UK nuclear industry is not only unprofitable, but
requires massive cash injections of billions just to keep
going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists, and other protestors, will be showing the
widespread public opposition to this unsafe, polluting and
uneconomic industry in the coming weeks with a protest flotilla in
the Irish sea against a shipment of nuclear fuel. The shipment is
being returned to Sellafield reprocessing plant from Japan after
safety documents for the shipment were forged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With nuclear power in crisis and the effects of our reliance on
fossil fuels becoming undeniable, with more floods, storms and
droughts, it is surely time for the winds of change to usher in a
new clean green energy future for the world in the 21st century.
Governments and industry do not want to change so we need to make
it happen for the good of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nuclear Free Irish Sea flotilla has caught up with BNFL's deadly cargo of weapons-usable plutonium in the Irish Sea. The dangerous and unnecessary cargo has been wandering the world's oceans for the past 75 days placing millions of lives and the marine environment at terrible risk.
&lt;div&gt;

            The Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla  peacefully protesting against BNFL shipment of plutonium..
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flotilla, comprising concerned seafarers from all corners of
the British Isles and the Republic of Ireland, left the port of
Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday morning to protest the ships'
passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear freighters were spotted mid-afternoon today between
Ireland and south west Wales and the protest was mounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, the nuclear freighters course through the Irish Sea
took them to within one mile of Irish territorial waters. The Irish
navy had sent a patrol boat and spotter plane to monitor the
shipment and to ensure it stayed away from their coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla protest was peaceful, with all of the sailboats
maintaining a safe distance from the heavily armed nuclear
freighters. Two hours before the protest the captain of the Rainbow
Warrior, via emergency radio channel 16, informed both nuclear
transport ships that the protest would be peaceful, and that there
would be no interference with the navigation of the vessels.
Neither the Pacific Pintail nor Pacific Teal responded, which is in
breach of maritime safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla numbers over twenty yachts, and
the Rainbow Warrior. Jim Corr, of Irish band 'The Corrs' is amongst
the crew. &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/bnfl/news_svrw_020915a.html" onclick="popWin('news_svrw_020915a.html','dub_openboat',392,377); return false;" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Jim explaining his motivation for
joining the protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flotilla is part of a global movement to stop the nuclear
reprocessing industry from producing and trading in weapons-usable
plutonium. British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) and the French company
COGEMA which operate reprocessing plants, have amassed more than
150,000 kilograms of plutonium so far at their respective nuclear
sites. Both companies hope to secure plutonium MOX fuel contracts
with Japan. If successful it would mean as many 100 plutonium sea
shipments. However, Japan's nuclear program is in crisis with plans
to use plutonium MOX fuel frozen by its largest nuclear company,
Tokyo Electric. Opposition to the plutonium program in Japan has
grown significantly since the original falsification scandal in
1999 with the Government and utilities under pressure to abandon
their controversial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This plutonium MOX should never have been shipped to Japan in
the first place in 1999. If they had their way it would now be
loaded into a nuclear reactor increasing the risks of a
catastrophic nuclear accident, " said Shaun Burnie, Greenpeace
Nuclear Campaigner on board the Rainbow Warrior. "The people in
Japan know this and are committed to stopping any further business
with Japan. The UK Government which continues to support BNFL and
the trade in bomb-material needs to stop this madness before there
is a disaster." Burnie added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Japan on July 4th, over 80 Governments have
condemned this shipment citing environmental, security and safety
concerns. Protests along the transport route included a South
Pacific/Tasman Sea flotilla between New Zealand and Australia.
Governments along the route have demanded that the vessels not
enter their 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The two ships are
bound for Barrow-in-Furness, where their cargo of plutonium MOX
will be unloaded and transported to the nuclear complex at
Sellafield. BNFL has no intention to do anything with the plutonium
MOX other than to dump it along with the other 70- 80,000 kilograms
of plutonium currently in store at Sellafield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ships will be greeted by protests from other boats in
the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla, when it arrives at 9am Tuesday
morning in Barrow-in-Furness, BNFL' s homeport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help us ensure that this is the last such transport by
sending a &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=vf3&amp;amp;s=vf"&gt;protest
letter to UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists remind Dow that it is responsible for the ongoing disaster in Bhopal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite failing to clean up Bhopal after buying Union Carbide,
Dow Chemicals continues with the business of selling chemicals and
avoiding a history it would rather see forgotten. Since purchasing
Union Carbide in 2001 Dow refuses to acknowledge responsibility for
the world's worst industrial disaster in Bhopal nearly 18 years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today, more than 30 people continue to die every month from
diseases related to the toxic gas leak in Bhopal and over 150,000
were chronically ill. It is an ongoing disaster and manifestations
of new diseases such as cancer and birth defects in new borns among
the exposed population tells us that the tragedy may well continue
for the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks Dow has been discovering that Bhopal cannot be
easily swept under the carpet. Despite suspected pressure from the
US and Dow, a Bhopal court recently threw out a claim by the Indian
Government to get the charges of culpable homicide against Warren
Anderson reduced to mere negligence. Anderson was the CEO of Union
Carbide at the time of the disaster. Then it was revealed that
after years evading justice hiding in the US, Anderson was
discovered living in luxury on Long Island. Annual membership of
his local tennis club alone is three times what a few of the
survivors of the disaster have received in compensation for a life
time of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local activists are not going to let Dow forget Bhopal.
Activists marched on the Indian headquarters of Dow in Mumbai. They
held banners outside the HQ demanding Dow take real action to help
Bhopal. While these concerned citizens are taking to the streets in
India, activists from around the world are being excluded from the
Earth Summit in South Africa. On the other hand corporate interest
are given the red carpet treatment and easy access to governments
and the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments are discussing making corporations more accountable
for their actions across the globe. A strong commitment to
corporate accountability with tough penalties for offenders would
help ensure there is never another Bhopal. However this is highly
unlikely because corporations such as Dow are busy lobbying in the
corridors of power to ensure that they just have to voluntarily say
they will try and be responsible towards people and the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that means when another avoidable disaster does happen
corporations can just say "sorry - we'll try and ensure it does not
happen again" and avoid any penalties. Not for the first time big
business and money wins against the will of the people, kept at
arms length by razor wire and police in Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;

	The plutonium transport ships are large, fast and bristling with guns and security personnel. But they balked at the prospect of passing a tiny flotilla of sailboats armed only with cameras, because it posed one unbearable risk: exposing a deadly and foolhardy mission to the full glare of public scrutiny.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Protesters Ian Cohen and Stuart Lennox hold a banner near the plutonium ship Pacific Teal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their fears may have been justified, for today the Nuclear Free
Seas Flotilla intercepted the plutonium transport and sent a
powerful anti-nuclear message around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We may only be 10 boats but we carry the wishes and demands of
millions of people, who want an end to the monstrous nuclear
industry worldwide," said flotilla protester Henk Haazen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost a week the small yachts of the Nuclear Free Seas
Flotilla sailed across the Pacific to demonstrate the huge public
opposition to the dangerous nuclear shipment. On Sunday, July 21
the flotilla of ten boats moved into position in the Tasman Sea,
halfway between Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two nuclear freighters, carrying a load of highly dangerous
nuclear MOX (mixed oxides of plutonium and uranium) from Japan to
the UK, seemed reluctant to face the full glare of publicity. They
drastically reduced their speed for the first time since leaving
Japan, temporarily halting their passage through the Tasman Sea --
an apparent attempt to avoid the Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the flotilla expected the two armed UK nuclear
freighters to try to sneak through the flotilla protest line during
the dead of night. And that's exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When darkness fell the nuclear freighters sped up and at
midnight, local time, they attempted to pass through the flotilla's
protest line between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the nuclear transport vessels were detected as they passed
between the protest vessels SV Tiama and Fio-oko. The protesters
launched an inflatable to shadow the ship, and at dawn they caught
up with the nuclear transports. Two swimmers, Australian
parliamentarian Ian Cohen and Stuart Lennox of Tasmania, were
dropped into the water. They held up a banner that read "Nuclear
Free Pacific" as the two nuclear ships steamed past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to make sure that there was no doubt in these shippers
minds that they are not welcome in this region," said Cohen, who
says he came there to represent Australians who express a strong
anti-nuclear sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla boats also radioed their message of protest to the
ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition is reaching a crescendo in nations along the
shipment's route. On July 17, the government of Vanuatu roundly
condemned the shipment, and the next day the Fijian prime minister
used a regional summit to express his outrage and opposition "to
those who are so willing to put the Pacific and our peoples at
risk." Then the 78 nations at the African-Caribbean-Pacific summit
condemned and isolated Japan and the UK for their shameful nuclear
waste MOX shipment in the summit's final declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment of MOX is being returned to the UK because its
producers, the government-owned British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL),
falsified critical safety data on the MOX and the Japanese refused

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Eleven of the twelve Greenpeace activists outside Atlantis Magistrates Court, where members of the group are on trial after staging a protest on Koeberg Nuclear Power Station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six climbers sailed into the harbour of the plant in inflatable
boats nine days ago at first light, scaled the pump house building
in front of the reactor domes and dropped two banners reading
"Nukes Out of Africa".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a four hour protest all six climbers and six boat crew in
the inflatables were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlantis magistrates court freed them today with fines of
SAR4000 for breaching security at South Africa's only nuclear power
plant at Koeberg, near Cape Town. The group was also fined a
further SAR1000 for failing to declare the true purpose of their
visit on visa applications, and for entering an unauthorised
harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Townsley was with them in Atlantis and says he is delighted
that all the activists are now free to go home, but sad for South
Africa that they will leave behind a nuclear facility that can only
bring long term pollution and threat to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since the protest at Koeberg it has become apparent that the
Greenpeace activists are not the only people who have broken the
law. The total failure of the plant owners, Eskom, to provide
safety, security and evacuation plans should be investigated by the
authorities and is yet another reason why this first nuclear
facility in Africa should be the last," said Townsley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest was part of our on going campaign during the Earth
Summit in Johannesburg, to take action to show the madness of
allowing global energy policy to be dictated by the nuclear and
fossil industries, when clean and safe alternatives such as solar
and wind power are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third of the planet - two billion people - live without access
to energy and still we see multi billion dollar subsidies being
pumped into the nuclear, oil, coal and gas industries. That money
could kick start a renewable energy revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this critical week for the Earth Summit, world leaders must
focus on bringing about that revolution. South Africa can take the
led by cancelling plans for any further nuclear power development
and putting the resources into clean and safe energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists left court wearing T-shirts which read
"Nukes Out Of Africa". The twelve activists are from Argentina,
Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, Mexico, Lebanon, UK, New Zealand
and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace  and other NGO activists wearing T-shirts with slogans reading fight till the end  and open your eyes in seven languages. Greenpeace was reacting to news that all renewable targets have been dropped from the Earth Summit Action Plan dealing with energy and climate policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists from Greenpeace and other organisations, assembled
outside the convention centre wearing t-shirts saying 'Open Your
Eyes' in the official languages of the United Nations. Holding up
personal sirens and whistling shrilly, the protestors signalled
their alarm to the Heads of State. Police moved in quickly and
moved the demonstrators off the summit grounds, detaining two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada Executive Director Peter Tabuns led the
protest, saying that "the world needs to open its eyes to what has
happened here. Multinational corporations have hijacked this summit
by ensuring that no meaningful action was taken to get renewable
energy into the hands of the poor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning when the members of our youth delegation assembled
to hold a pre-approved and officially sanctioned press conference
in the civic heart of Johannesburg, BMW, which has been allowed
exclusive use of the plaza to exhibit the least polluting of its
cars, didn't want their giant inflatable globe to be the backdrop
to a Greenpeace event. Wearing bullet proof vests, the United
Nations police force marched the 10 or so young, non-violent
speakers away from the zone and detained them away from BMW's slick
exhibition domes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the police began to move the confused youth delegation away
there were cries of protest from the crowd. Swept up into the
removal was a nearby Free Tibet activist group, which was also
barricaded by a wall of police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaken, the youth delegation continued surrounded by a ring of
officers. Disappointed with the actions of aged delegates who are
deciding the future of the youth of the world, they unveiled a
banner denouncing the backroom tactics of the United States,
signalling it was time for a new Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMW was quick to realise it had a public relations problem, and
called Greenpeace to say there had been a misunderstanding, and
denied that they had called the police. When asked by Greenpeace
political director Remi Parementier, they affirmed that BMW
supports the Kyoto protocol and wants a strong signal from
governments calling for its ratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language adopted at the Earth Summit does nothing to further the
Kyoto protocol, and merely urges states that have not ratified to
do so.&lt;/p&gt;

	For almost a week eleven small yachts have been heading across the Pacific to demonstrate the huge public opposition to the shipment of highly dangerous nuclear cargo that is being transported across the Pacific en route from Japan to the UK. Now they are in position on the route of the shipment. But the two armed nuclear freighters seem reluctant to face the full glare of publicity.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace and Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla in the Tasman Sea. They are waiting to deliver their protest message to two armed nuclear freighters.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having halted their passage through the Tasman Sea it appears
that the two vessels are trying to avoid the Nuclear Free Seas
Flotilla and they are expected to continue their journey by
sneaking through under cover of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships have drastically reduced their speed for the first
time since leaving Japan. Their presence across the tiny strip of
international waters has caused a stand-off between public opinion
and the arrogance of the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"BNFL are on the run, they ran away from Takahama Bay in Japan
three hours before a court hearing in London which could have
stopped this shipment from taking place, they are now running away
from our eleven small yachts. They know about the huge opposition
they have created in the Pacific and this protest is humiliating
for them," said Richard Allen of the Nuclear Free Flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla boats arrived at their meeting point two days ago
and have been preparing to meet up with the boats in order to
deliver their protest message. The flotilla boats have more than 50
people from 10 different countries on board. The crews range in age
from three to sixty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As an elected member of the New South Wales Parliament,
representing many Australians who have expressed strong anti-
nuclear sentiment it is an honour to join the 50 people from other
nations who are participating in the Nuclear Free Flotilla at their
own expense and considerable risk to help create a safe nuclear
free future," said Ian Cohen, member of the New South Wales
Parliament with the flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment of faulty nuclear fuel is being returned to the UK
because its producers, the government-owned British Nuclear Fuels
(BNFL), falsified critical safety data on the fuel and the Japanese
refused to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UK, Japan and France's attempts to keep the plutonium
industry alive are completely irresponsible and show a dangerous
disregard for the real proliferation risks," said Stephen Campbell,
Greenpeace Nuclear Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Pacific Nations have called for an immediate stop to the
transport of nuclear shipments through their waters. The UK and
Japan can no longer ignore their demands. The fact that the ships
have stopped where they are shows that they will avoid breaching
the Exclusive Economic Zones of Australia and New Zealand at all
costs, yet they blatantly stormed through the EEZs at least six
Pacific Nations. This shows their arrogant double standards to the
region," said Angenette Heffernan, Greenpeace Nuclear
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	While peaceful protesters highlighted a vision of clean, green energy for the Philippines a security guard fired a warning shot in the air over the heads of activists. The protest was against the biggest coal-fired power station in the Philippines.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/security-from-the-phillipine-s.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/security-from-the-phillipine-s.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Security from the Phillipine's biggest coal fired power station, Sual, fire a warning shot to activists.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five activists were arrested during the action at Sual power
plant, in the province of Pangasinan. The plant, which was built
with funding from the UK, France and the US, and runs on coal from
China, Indonesia and Australia was listed as one of the five most
problematic power stations in the country last week by the
Philippine Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five activists from onboard our ship MV Arctic Sunrise climbed
the cranes at the Sual dock where a shipment of coal was being
unloaded and hung a banner reading "Clean Energy Now". A team of 30
activists, including teams in three inflatable boats bearing
"Choose Positive Energy" flags, were supporting the climbers, ready
to undertake further activities. The shot was fired as activists
attempted to paint on the ship unloading coal. No one was hurt. The
arrested activists, who have already been released without
charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Like developing countries around the world, the Philippines is
hungry for clean, reliable power but coal-fired power stations like
Sual are not the answer," said campaigner Athena Ballesteros. "Coal
is one of the most greenhouse intensive fuels - it is dirty,
expensive and damages our climate. That's why we want investment in
renewable energy like solar, wind and modern biomass power for the
Philippines."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Foreign interests and foreign money are dictating the
Philippines' energy policy," said Ballesteros. "People of the
Philippines have been campaigning against coal-fired power stations
like Sual for years. We don't want this dirty, conventional
technology dumped on us from rich northern countries that are more
interested in profits than our needs, or protecting our climate."
Less than 1 percent of the Philippines' energy plan includes solar
wind or modern biomass power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sual is typical of the carbon-based power plants the Philippines
has been developing in the past decade. It is owned by the US
subsidiary Mirant, which is the largest foreign investor in the
Philippines, and was built by Alstom, a UK and French owned
corporation. It runs on coal imported from China, Indonesia and
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There hasn't been a new coal-fired power station built in the
UK since 1972," said Anita Goldsmith from the UK, on site at the
action. "If coal is not good enough at home, then why is Tony Blair
and the UK Government dumping this dirty, technology on developing
nations like the Philippines? It's hypocritical and scandalous of
the UK to push coal in Asia. While the UK promises to cut
greenhouse emissions at home, it is exporting more than half that
amount overseas."&lt;/p&gt;

	A CO2 experiment that sounds more like bad science fiction than a global solution has been delayed because of international pressure. But the message is clear. Countries that are not yielding to pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are quietly manoeuvring in the background to find hi-tech solutions rather than make the right move to green energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/oil-refinery-in-the-netherland.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Instead of stopping emissions like these at an oil refinery in the Netherlands, scientists in Norway want to pump the emissions into the sea. Then it's just a matter of waiting to see what happens.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any 5 year-old can tell you that if the kitchen sink is
overflowing with water, you have to turn off the tap, not cut a
hole in the floor and let it drain down to the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the scientists trying to solve the planet's problems are
getting desperate and hell bent on finding a modern technological
solution rather than stopping the problem at the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same countries that are resisting international efforts to
dramatically reduce carbon dioxide and climate change inducing
emissions have cooked up a plan to dump this pollution in the
ocean. A group of researcher institutions from the US, Norway,
Canada, Australia and Japan are funding this mad science experiment
to dump 5.4 tonnes of liquid carbon dioxide into the sea of Norway.
But because of growing international opposition the experiment has
been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These corporations, who know their technology belongs in last
century, would rather keep lining their pockets while the
atmosphere chokes than do what everyone knows will have to be done
sooner rather than later. Old blokes, old money, old technology,
old ideas - soon to be dead unless the earth's atmosphere loses
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't seem to occur to them that this technology is illegal
in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumping industrial waste at sea, including CO2 from fossil fuel
emissions is illegal under the international OSPAR and London
Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boneheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CO2 is the world's biggest industrial waste product and is
causing more damage to our environment than any other single
factor. Ice caps are melting, sea levels rising, coral reefs are
being wiped out and our planet may never completely recover from
the effects of climate change if we don't kick-start a revolution
in clean green energy for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As governments scramble to find the least painful economic
solutions to climate change, this consortium of countries was
quietly working in the background without anyone knowing about
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last few weeks, the experiment has been the subject
of concerns in Norway and around the world. The OSPAR commission
also politely pointed out that they need to come up with a common
position on this as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumping blocks of frozen CO2 at sea and pumping liquid CO2
through pipelines under 3000m which they expect would sink and form
"lakes" on the sea bed - these are the rational solutions that have
been suggested so that we can maintain an ignorant lifestyle of
energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boneheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay of the Norwegian experiment is the first step. The
Rainbow Warrior will arrive in Oslo, Norway on Tuesday and we will
meet with the Norwegian Environment Ministry officals and others
opposed to this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

	A UK study of human volunteers fed a hamburger with genetically modified soya and a milkshake has found GM genes in human gut bacteria. But more surprising than the research itself, is the fact that this is the FIRST human volunteer trial on the effects of GM foods on our bodies.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/7/hamburgers-hide-health-dangers.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hamburgers hide health dangers beyond high fat content.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've known for years that a meal of hamburgers and a milkshake
isn't good for us, but now there is new cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by Newcastle university for the UK Food Standards Agency
revealed genetically modified (GM) genes are showing up in human
stomach bacteria. The researchers fed seven volunteers who have had
their lower intestines removed a hamburger with GM soya and a
milkshake. The stools tested from the volunteers' colostomy bags
showed that a "relatively large portion of the genetically modified
DNA survived the passage through the small bowel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More astonishing, this is the world's first trial of GM foods on
human volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, did you say world's &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; study of the effects of GM food on human
volunteers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right. We have been eating genetically modified
organisms in our foods for years now and this is the first time
that the effects have been studied on real live human beings since
the foods were widely introduced. At least for which the results
have been published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet all along, biotechnology companies have been telling
consumers - "it's safe, it's good for you" - assuming that the
genetically engineered genes would be digested and disappear like
asteroids burning up on entry into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study went further to see if this genetically modified DNA
could be transferred via bacteria in the large intestine. In
laboratory simulated gastrointestinal tracts, three of the seven
samples revealed bacteria had taken on the herbicide-resistant
gene. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;And this was after only one GM meal.&lt;/span&gt; There have
been no studies of the long term effects of introducing GM food
into people's diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no bacteria containing the herbicide tolerant gene were
obtained from the faeces of volunteers with complete digestive
systems, this study clearly demonstrates that we can get
genetically modified DNA in our stomach bacteria, something the
bio-tech companies used to deny was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research raises some pretty serious health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years environmental and consumer groups have been
questioning the safety of bio-tech companies using
antibiotic-resistant marker genes to identify the GM cells during
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scientists believe that eating GM food containing these
marker genes could encourage gut bacteria or oral bacteria to
develop antibiotic resistance. This new research suggests that this
could very well happen, even at very low levels after just one
meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing we can surely conclude from this study is we
still don't know enough about the effects of GM foods on humans or
the environment. The companies making millions off this technology
have taken the attitude it is safe until it is proven unsafe, but
we must insist on a new global policy - better safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

	Export credit agencies (ECAs) are little-known but important accomplices in the cynical practice of exporting dirty and outmoded technology to developing countries. This business exposes citizens of the developing world to health and environmental risks and contributes to the growing burden of climate changing gases in the atmosphere.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Breathing new life into fossils: ECAs play critical role in pushing obsolete technology on developing nations.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed nations have seen the "writing on the wall" when it
comes to polluting coal-fired and nuclear power generation. The
health and environmental risks of using these technologies are so
onerous that the United Kingdom, for example, hasn't built a
coal-fired power plant since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet through its national export credit agency, the Export Credit
Guarantee Department (ECGD), the UK Government has funded exports
of fossil fuel-burning and nuclear power generation projects worth
an average of 1.76 billion pounds stirling every year over the last
decade. Like other ECAs, the ECGD is a government agency that helps
private corporations engage in business activities abroad by
underwriting projects, effectively insuring them. The ECGD is the
subject of a new Greenpeace report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objectionable trade exposes the people of developing
countries to the unnecessary health and pollution risks of these
obsolete technologies. Furthermore, the above-mentioned ECGD
projects alone mean one billion tonnes of the greenhouse gas carbon
dioxide will be added to the atmosphere over the next twenty years,
contributing to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, poor choices made now will adversely affect the
energy pathways of these countries for the next 30 to 40 years. For
example, since 1992 the ECGD has provided 193 guarantees of support
to 140 fossil fuel and nuclear generation projects and fossil fuel
extraction projects in 38 different countries, including India,
China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South
Africa, Zimbabwe, and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unacceptable, especially since governments agreed at the
2001 Marrakech climate change summit (COP 7) that ECAs must play a
part to ensure the transfer of clean, renewable energy
technologies. Yet as of June 2002 the UK's ECGD had provided
precisely zero assistance to renewable energy projects in the
previous three years, an abysmal record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role as a pusher of dirty technologies makes the UK a
hypocrite in its attitude toward the Kyoto Protocol on climate
change. Even if the UK fully meets their Kyoto commitments to
reduce climate-changing gases, half of these gains will be
cancelled by those emissions that are "directly attributable" to
the ECGD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECAs must move quickly to reform themselves to actively support
the transfer of renewable energy technologies to the developing
world, and phase out their support for dirty energy
investments.&lt;/p&gt;

	With the Earth Summit on Sustainable Development only a month away, some countries still don't understand what the word "sustainable" means. They are trying to push polluting coal and nuclear technology on developing nations as a solution to their electricity needs and global climate change.
&lt;div&gt;

            "Higantes" welcome the Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise on the first stop of the South East Asia Choose Positive Energy tour.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must have come to her in a flash, a divine epiphany during
another boring bureaucratic meeting. "I know," she thought, "we
will export nuclear energy to developing nations. They'll get off
our backs about wanting electricity and we will claim we are
offering a solution to climate change at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else could European Union Energy Commissioner Loyola de
Palacio have been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal presented by de Palacio yesterday to push polluting
coal and nuclear technology on developing countries at the
Johannesburg Earth Summit next month is not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, Canada and the US are also undermining international
action against climate change by pushing climate-disrupting fossil
fuels and radioactive waste-generating nuclear technology on
developing nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Safe" nuclear energy, along with "clean" coal, will help stop
climate change, they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, "inherently safe" reactors are a myth. An accident can
occur in any nuclear reactor, releasing deadly fission products
into the environment. Even normal operation of reactors regularly
releases radioactive materials into the air and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of burgeoning nuclear waste has also never been
dealt with. It's been 50 years, and the nuclear industry still
hasn't found a solution to disposing highly radioactive spent fuel
rods, for example. This waste will be around for hundreds of
thousands, sometimes millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps they have found a solution - dump it on developing
nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is also no such thing as clean coal, for this is the
world's dirtiest fuel. A new clean coal plant created with federal
subsidies in Jacksonville, US, for example, will still spew 10
times as much smog-causing nitrogen oxide as a natural gas
generator. It will also release twice as much carbon dioxide, which
contributes to climate change, and considerable amounts of sulphur
dioxide, an ingredient in smog and acid rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious oxymorons aside, it is mad folly to replace one
environmental disaster with another. Climate change will be stopped
by increased energy efficiency, and shift to renewable energy such
as wind, solar and biomass. It will not be solved by taking a step
backward to the dirty and dangerous technologies of the last
century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developing nations don't want our dirty, antiquated
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish Energy Commissioner's proposal was met by protest
today in the Philippines. Half a dozen traditional Filipino harvest
giants rallied at Manila harbour as the Greenpeace ship Arctic
Sunrise arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five metre papier mache protestors or "higantes" are one of
the Phillippine's most famous cultural icons. Historically,
regional workers made higantes for the harvest celebrations to both
give thanks for the crop, and at the same time poke fun at their
unaware Spanish overseers, who assumed the giants were honouring
rather than mocking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an apt response to a proposal that is energy colonialism
at its worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for electricity in developing countries is growing,
but these days there is a choice. Why should developing countries
be forced to make the same mistakes their northern partners did?
The European nuclear industry is on its knees, crippled by
spiralling costs and a growing radioactive waste mountain. Germany,
Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands are currently
engaged in nuclear phase outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simply obscene for the European Commission to push its
deadly mistakes on developing countries when the technology exists
for clean, sustainable energy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are lobbying governments to make a commitment at the Earth
Summit to provide clean and affordable renewable energy to the two
billion people around the world who currently live without
electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

	A controversial scheme to dispose of the fossil fuel industry's waste problems has the Norwegian government poised to undermine international law.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Renewable energy such as wind, not ocean dumping of CO2, is the solution to climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumping industrial waste at sea is illegal, yet Norway's
Pollution Control Authority (SFT) has given a consortium of
research institutions approval to dump 5.4 tonnes of liquid carbon
(CO2) dioxide in the Norwegian Sea in late July and early
August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is the world's biggest industrial waste product,
and its build-up in the atmosphere stems mainly from burning oil,
coal and gas. This is the primary cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dumping of CO2 into oceans is a highly suspect approach to
the problem, one which might ultimately prove to be a climate
time-bomb. "In light of the ecological risks of carbon
sequestration in the deep oceans, and the unproven long-term
benefits of this approach, further research of this approach should
be abandoned", says scientist Paul Johnson at University of
Exeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium planning the experiment is funded by governments
in the USA, Australia and Canada, countries known as the "Filthy
Three" for obstructing and undermining international agreements on
climate change and the Earth Summit. Japan, Norway and the coal
industry-supported ABB Corporate Research are also part of this
consortium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Minister of the Environment must now reverse the
SFT's decision, and overturn the approval for this misguided
experiment. Both the London and OSPAR Conventions forbid the
dumping of industrial waste at sea, including CO2 derived from
fossil fuel use. Should Norway allow this test to proceed, it will
be a first step towards allowing industrial dumping of CO2 at sea.
This would break these international laws and spur consumption of
climate-changing fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's no surprise that the USA, Australia and Canada are
supporting this project. However, we are surprised that Norway once
again is volunteering to be their tool in derailing international
agreements and promoting continued use of fossil fuels," said Truls
Gulowsen, Greenpeace Norway climate campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two similar CO2 dumping experiments were called off in Hawaii
because of grassroots public protest. Now groups in Norway,
including Greenpeace, WWF and Friends of the Earth have opposed the
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This must be stopped, as there are so many other ways to combat
climate change that are not nearly as insane as this approach,"
said Hawaiian fisherman Isaac Harp, who led a successful effort to
halt dumping in that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real solution to climate change is to replace fossil fuels
with renewable energy such as solar and wind power.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Indian government's move to reduce charges against a former Union Carbide CEO has met with protests and hunger strikes in India. The 1984 Bhopal gas disaster that has killed 20,000 to date and injured hundreds of thousands continues its toxic legacy today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace joins Bhopal survivors to protest moves by Indian government to reduce charges against a former Union Carbide CEO.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Anderson, former CEO of Union Carbide, has been hiding in the United States during the almost 18 years since the disaster. The victims, on the other hand, have been left with lingering disability and disease in the shadow of the chemical plant, where tonnes of dangerous, highly toxic chemicals remain strewn. Their land and water is contaminated with heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals, and fair compensation remains outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Carbide's decision to cut safety corners at its Bhopal factory was purely economic, but had massive human consequences. On the night of the poisonous gas leak, six safety measures designed to prevent such a leak had either malfunctioned, were turned off or were otherwise inadequate. In addition, the safety siren, intended to alert the community, was turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Indian government's Central Bureau of Investigation wants to reduce the outstanding charges against the former CEO Anderson to the point where he could face only a small fine or at maximum a sentence of two years, rather than a possible ten years imprisonment. This reduction from culpable homicide to negligence also means that the sentence would not have to be served in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the enormity of the crime and its consequences, it is little wonder Indians have taken to the streets in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai to protest their government's shameful display of leniency to corporate criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This travesty of justice also led three protesters, two of whom are Bhopal disaster survivors, to begin a hunger strike in Delhi on June 29 when the impending move was announced. Their hunger strike continues through today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Delhi Demonstration, Ananthapadmanabhan Ananth of Greenpeace said that the government must reverse the decision, and play its proper role to ensure those responsible are held accountable and liable for the ongoing disaster, "just as they would be had it occurred in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision could have important future consequences. "If the Indian government does not reject this move, it will give a clear signal that India is open to exploitation by other multinational corporations," said Ananth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. multinational Union Carbide shed its infamous name by merging with Dow Chemicals in 2002. Dow not only gained the company's assets, it also assumed its liabilities in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is working with local groups and other NGOs to ensure Dow cleans up the factory site, to secure long-term medical treatment and economic compensation for survivors, and to provide clean drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

            GMO free soybeans.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, called "Record Harvest - Record Hunger" focuses on
the Argentinean experience. Despite promises from the GE industry
that GE crops will help feed the world, events in Argentina
illustrate the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emiliano Ezcurra of Greenpeace said in Rome that, "by
surrendering to food dictators such as Monsanto and Syngenta, who
seek to dominate the world´s food production from fields to fork,
Argentina has put its food security at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace appealed to the World Food Summit delegates today
with a banner that said: "Food Dictators won´t feed the world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the enthusiastic introduction of GE crops in 1996,
Argentina has become the second largest producer of GE soy,
exporting most of it as animal feed. The land used for soy
cultivation has nearly doubled, which subsequently has increased
the soy harvest to the record level of nearly 30 million metric
tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the same period, food insecurity has greatly
increased and half the population, 18 out of 37 million, now live
on the edge of starvation or are unable to meet their basic needs,
according to official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small and medium size farms disappeared in record numbers at the
end of the 90s,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and large numbers of people were displaced from rural
livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            HMS Nottingham, one of the British Navy's most advanced destroyers ran aground off the east coast of Australia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destroyer HMS Nottingham, one of the most advanced ships of
the British navy, was rumoured to be in the Tasman as a security
escort for the plutonium ship. The grounding during a week of bad
weather that has devastated the Federated States of Micronesia only
highlights how irresponsible and dangerous this whole transport
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Nuclear Fuels' plutonium shipment will be passing
through these rough winter waters in the Tasman Sea within two
weeks on route from Japan to England. The risk of catastrophic
accident such as fire or collision involving the ship Pacific
Pintail and the release of its cargo of plutonium into the
environment is all the greater given the failure of British or
Japanese governments to conduct a thorough environmental impact
assessment as required by international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past week it has also been revealed that the Pacific
Pintail and escort ship Teal are suffering from corrosion that
threatens their structural safety. British Nuclear Fuels refused to
release details concerning the state of the ships. The Japanese
government only learnt about this problem after news reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really safe for these corroding ships to pass through
waters that have grounded one of the British navy's most advanced
destroyers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts of the route planned for the plutonium shipments are
officially classified as Marine High Risk Areas by Lloyds of
London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Stephen Campbell seriously wonders
if those who are making the decision to send these ships through
this region in the middle of winter know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The shipment is dangerous enough on its own let alone adding
risk by sending it through the southern seas in winter," said
Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions have also been raised regarding why the HMS Nottingham
is in this region in the first place. UK Channel 4 News has
speculated that it is there to protect the plutonium shipments from
terrorist attack, although the ministry of defence has denied the
rumour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There have been rumours running for the last few months that
the shipment of reject plutonium, carrying 255 kilograms of
weapons-usable material would have an additional escort that would
not be part of the public plan," said Campbell. "Clearly those
making the shipment recognise what a security risk it is".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HMS Nottingham ran aground off Lord Howe 300 miles north
east of Sydney, near where the Pacific Flotilla will converge.
There have been no casualties, but the ship is now leaking oil and
taking on water. Only last week an oil tanker also grounded off the
coast of Fiji and the rough winter weather of the southern seas is
far from over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a group of citizens are braving the rough waters in the
Tasman to protest the plutonium shipment. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/features/details?features%5fid=16944"&gt;

	The genetic contamination of maize in Mexico's Oaxaca state is a serious hazard for biodiversity in this region, a world centre of genetic diversity for the crop. Now a commission of NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) has agreed to study the problem.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Genetic contamination threatens biodiversity of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico, the world centre of diversity for this important crop.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes after indigenous communities from Oaxaca,
along with Greenpeace and three other NGOs filed a request under
Article 13 of the North American Agreement on Environmental
Cooperation (NAAEC), the NAFTA environmental side agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision by NAFTA's Commission for Environmental
Cooperation (CEC) publicly recognises the gravity of the situation
in Mexico, where over 300 locally cultivated and wild maize
varieties are threatened by genetic contamination. This
contamination most likely originated from US-imported GE maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case also creates a precedent, because this is the first
time that an environmental oversight body of an international trade
agreement will address environmental damage caused by genetically
engineered (GE) crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector Magallón, genetic engineering campaigner for Mexico
pointed out that, "The Mexican Government has known about this
contamination for almost a year and hasn't done anything to stop it
from spreading or solve the problem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico should require segregation of GE and conventional maize,
and ban the import of GE maize from the United States. Recognition
of the seriousness of this issue should also prompt calls for
identification of the companies responsible for the transgenic
pollution, and compensation for local affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;

	As G8 foreign ministers were set to discuss schemes to counter nuclear and other security threats, Greenpeace called on them to invest in true security rather than squander billions of dollars on destabilizing the planet.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace warned that global security could only be achieved
through&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sustainable environmental measures coupled with social and
financial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;justice for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed US funding scheme to counter nuclear proliferation
and other security threats asks the US and G7 countries (excluding
Russia) to contribute $US20 billion over ten years to fund a
process that uses plutonium to create mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for
nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this move would threaten both the environment and global
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Carroll, Greenpeace nuclear and disarmament campaigner
said, "Plutonium, like any nuclear material, is inherently unsafe,
damaging the environment and human health for generations and
creating a product that countries could use to produce nuclear
weapons, or could fall into the hands of terrorists."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also calling on G8 countries to strengthen their
efforts to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;combat illegal logging, which is being reviewed at the meeting.
Many G8 countries, including Canada, France and the UK, continue to
import wood products from regions including the Amazon and Liberia
where illegal production takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace forests campaigner Uta Bellion warned that, "As well
as the environmental and social impact of illegal logging, there is
clear documentation that forest countries like Liberia use the
logging industry as a front for terrorist activities, including
funding groups such as Al Qaeda."&lt;/p&gt;

	Today the highest court in the Netherlands ruled that a ship containing asbestos, heavy metals and other toxic material should be classified as toxic waste.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists blocking ship containing toxic asbestos as it enters shipbreaking yard.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vessel will not be allowed to proceed to Asia to be
scrapped, preventing it from causing harm to both people and the
environment at an Indian shipbreaking yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision is important because it is the first ever legal
recognition that a ship containing asbestos must be treated as
hazardous waste. It sets a precedent that in the future ships must
be cleaned of toxic materials before being sent to shipbreaking
yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This ruling sets an important precedent for the future of
dealing with scrap ships," said Mariëtta Harjono, Greenpeace
campaigner. "The verdict on the Sandrien will bring international
legislation on scrap ships a little bit closer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessel, named the Sandrien, has been detained in Amsterdam
since February 2001. A solution is quickly needed for the Sandrien
and her crew. The ship owner who abandoned his responsibility
towards his employees will likely never be seen again. The stranded
crew are still waiting for overdue wages, and for repatriation to
India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year hundreds of ships are sent to India for scrapping.
This work is done under miserable conditions and without proper
equipment. But this number will increase in the next few years
because all single-hull oil tankers must stop trading before 2015.
International legislation is urgently needed to ensure that scrap
ships are stripped of all toxic material before they may be
exported to breakers' yards in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made to look like the ones used by the Japanese whaling fleet,
the boxes highlight the commercial reality of so-called
"scientific" whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, a "whale meat" delivery van pulled up in front
of the Japanese Embassy. Whale meat boxes where used to build a
wall that said, "Whales are NOT for Sale" on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, Greenpeace unloaded truckloads of whale meat boxes,
and stacked them in front of the Japanese embassy. Yesterday, in
Austria, 80 protestors sporting white uniforms and white painted
faces shouldered their burden of whale tails and whale meat boxes
on sticks and stood in silent vigil in front of the Japanese
embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, a petition signed by marine and cetacean biologists
from around the world calling upon the government to end its
scientific whaling was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. In Australia, there was a display of Butoh dancing by
artists in white body paint on a red carpet in front of the
Japanese consulate in Sydney. Butoh combines modern and traditional
Japanese dance styles.&lt;/p&gt;

	Research reveals that whale blubber stored in Norway awaiting export to Japan is unfit for human consumption. The samples of whale blubber studied by independent scientists in Germany are contaminated with various halogenated-organic contaminants such as PCBs, DDT and brominated flame retardants.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Ellingsen factory, biggest whale meat and blubber storage in Norway.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan and Norway have been discussing a resumption in whale
trade following Norway's decision in January 2001 to lift its ban
on whale exports. The decision was made despite the fact that this
is in contradiction to the ban imposed by the Convention on the
International Trade in Endangered Species on the trade of whale
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan applied to the Trade Ministry for
permission to import whale meat from Norway, but as yet no
shipments have been made. Norway's decision to begin exporting
whale meat and blubber to Japan has been fuelled by the desire of
the Norwegian whalers to profit from the high prices paid for whale
products on the luxury food market in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thilo Maack, Greenpeace oceans campaigner, says it would be
irresponsible of the Norwegian government to export whale blubber
to Japan and irresponsible of the Japanese government to sell it
for eating. "It is unfit for human consumption and should be
disposed of safely. If someone ate a piece of whale blubber the
size of my thumb, they would be dosing themselves many times over
the advisory limits of some of the most toxic compounds known to
humans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norwegian traders have stockpiled 1000 metric tonnes of whale
blubber in cold storage waiting for export. Last year, the Japanese
government had to put two hundred metric tonnes of unsold whale
meat and blubber in storage due to the declining market for whale
products in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report confirms the fears of environmentalists and Japanese
consumer groups that whale products are unfit for eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of such toxic chemicals in whale blubber shows the
extent to which our oceans are contaminated and underlines how
vital it is that whales are protected from hunting and that the
current international ban on trade remains intact. The status of
the minke whales hunted by Norway is uncertain and these results
show that whales are vulnerable to not only commercial whaling
activities but also to wider environmental threats.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan now has the US over a barrel as it is obliged by its
treaty obligations with the Inuit to grant them their whaling
quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet their treaty requirements the US will now have to
contravene the IWC decision, setting a precedent that Japan and its
alternate delegate Masayuki Komatsu will find very useful in
pursuing their target of another 25 minke whales for their coastal
whalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Page, Greenpeace oceans campaigner pointed out that,
"Subsistence whaling is very different to the Fisheries Agency of
Japan´s request for 25 minke whales for coastal whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coastal whaling is for profit, not to simply survive. Coastal
whaling is commercial whaling, not subsistence whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government's manipulation of the meeting through
vote buying made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a mockery of the IWC's democratic process. With vote buying
Japan effectively wields 15 votes, instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this vote buying strategy, the Fisheries Agency of Japan
failed to gain a resumption of commercial whaling. But the
Government of Japan will continue to carry out some commercial
whaling under the dishonest title of "scientific research".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals by the Government of Japan for secret ballots, which
would have provided cover for vote buying and viewed by many as
undemocratic, also failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is obviously disappointed that the proposals for a
South Pacific Whale Sanctuary and a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary
failed. Given that these proposals had the support of the countries
within the sanctuary, it is extremely disturbing that the
governments of Japan, Norway, Antigua and Barbuda, Palau and many
others&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see fit to deny these countries their wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

            Philippine artists dramatize the dangers of pollutants from incineration.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and 126 community groups spanning 54 countries
demanded governments end waste incineration, and adopt recycling
instead. This global day of action was spearheaded by Greenpeace
and GAIA, the Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance. Demonstrations
swept across the globe, from Asia to Africa, Europe, North America
and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Incinerators are multi-billion dollar pollutors and waste the
planet's valuable resources," said Greenpeace toxics campaigner,
Veronica Odriozola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, protestors climbed and capped the stack of that
nation's biggest incinerator. In Ankara, Turkey, climbers on ropes
descended the 127-metre Atakule tower and hung a giant banner
reading "Ban the Burn." In Basingstoke, UK and in Bilbao, Spain,
protestors stopped construction at the sites of two new municipal
waste incinerators. In Chile activists blocked the entrance of an
incineration plant, and in the Philippines actors demonstrated the
toxic effects of pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of action took place as leaders met in Geneva for the
first time since agreeing persistent poisons must be eliminated
under the Stockholm Convention. Despite the agreement to ban the
poisons, many governments are still promoting industries that
release them into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To continue promoting incineration while agreeing to eliminate
persistent organic pollutants is sheer hypocrisy," said
Odriozola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treaty identifies all waste incinerators as a primary source
of PCBs, furans and cancer causing dioxins, the most harmful
chemicals known to science. It obligates governments to give
priority to alternative ways to manage wastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemicals released from incinerators cause a variety of health
problems, including immune and reproductive system defects,
spontaneous abortions, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hormone
disruption and cancers. Some fish caught in European Union waters
are so contaminated with dioxins they have been declared unfit for
human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today one hundred activists in the important German harbour of Nordenham protested the import of timber from ancient forests.

            Greenpeace activists in Nordenham paint 'Save Ancient Forests Now' on logs stored at the port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists climbed the unloading cranes of the harbour and
unfurled flags that read, "G8 Save the Ancient Forests Now." At the
same time, more than 80 activists painted the same message on the
logs stored at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protests continue Greenpeace efforts to put the spotlight on
the plight of ancient forests, during the G8 meeting in Kananaskis,
Canada. G8 governments continue to allow illegal timber and timber
products into their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christoph Thies of Greenpeace said, "In 1998, the G8 committed
to fight illegal logging and protect forests. But four years on,
the G8's Action Programme on Forests has been quietly buried, while
it's business as usual in the world's last ancient forests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Illegal logging is as high as 80 percent in some forest
nations, deforestation rates are higher than ever - and industrial
logging remains the single most important factor in driving that
destruction," Thies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the heads of G8 Governments,
representing some of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the most powerful players on the planet, not to let their Action
Programme on Forests die, but to use their influence at both the G8
Summit next week, and the Earth Summit itself, to halt ancient
forest destruction, hold accountable the corporations responsible,
and implement sustainable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Mexico decreed the Mexican Whale Sanctuary in all of its EEZ (exclusive economic zone) in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The area of the sanctuary is approximately three million square kilometers.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/greenpeace-activists-with-a-ho.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/greenpeace-activists-with-a-ho.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hold demonstration to demand Mexican whale sancturary.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mexican whale sanctuary is the biggest protected area in
Mexico and the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;largest national whale sanctuary in the world. It occupies an
area equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;half of Europe. All of these European countries would fit
inside: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark,
France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, Norway Luxembourg," said
Juan Carlos Cantú, biodiversity campaigner of Greenpeace
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary would protect 21 species of cetaceans: the right
whale, blue whale, fin whale, grey whale, sei whale, Bryde's whale,
minke whale, humpback whale, sperm whale, pygmy sperm whale, dwarf
sperm whale, Baird's beaked whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, Gervais'
beaked whale, ginko-toothed beaked whale, pygmy beaked whale,
melon-headed whale, killer whale, pygmy killer whale, false killer
whale and pilot whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Mexico started the campaign to create the sanctuary
in 1999. More than 120 thousand signatures were collected in that
year and 125 Mexican and international NGOs signed a letter to the
Mexican President requesting the creation of the sanctuary. Over
the years, thousands of Mexicans sent letters, faxes and e-mails to
the Mexican president requesting the sanctuary. In 2000, a poll in
Mexico City showed that 84 percent of those polled were in favor of
the creation of the sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the offshoots of the campaign was the modification of the
Wildlife Law in 2000 to forbid all whaling in Mexico for commercial
or subsistence purposes, and the listing of all cetaceans as under
special protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decree states that the sanctuary will support the
maintenance of the environmental conditions that are necessary for
the biological functions of whales, such as reproduction, calving,
growth, migration, learning and feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The creation of this sanctuary is a victory for the
conservation of whales and for the Mexican people. The fact that it
was created during the week that the IWC meeting took place in
Shimonoseki, Japan is a message to the entire world that Mexico is
against whaling. This sanctuary should serve as an example for
other countries to follow so that eventually all the oceans of the
world become sanctuaries to protect all species of whales," said
Cantú.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace called on governments to curb the devastation wreaked by big business, by adopting a set of principles formed in the wake of the Bhopal disaster.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            Wall of shame: Activists hold up pictures of toxic hotspots during an Earth Summit prep meeting in Bali.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While activists held up posters showing hotspots of environmental crime, Greenpeace urged governments to commit to an international agreement on corporate accountability and liability. The demonstration took place along an avenue taken by delegates as they entered the last preparatory meeting before the August Earth Summit, or World Summit on Sustainability (WSSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also today, Greenpeace released a report titled &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/26211/corporatecrimes_entire.pdf"&gt;Corporate Crimes&lt;/a&gt;, which details the environmental and human fallout of irresponsible corporate behaviour around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Marcelo Furtado said, "Governments have allowed, and continue to allow, big business to wreak havoc."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You only have to look at the aftermath of the Bhopal chemical disaster 18 years ago. Nothing much has been done by the corporation responsible to provide justice, rehabilitation and compensation to the victims of the disaster, or clean-up of the site which is still heavily contaminated and littered with stockpiles of hazardous wastes," continued Furtado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is asking governments to take up the Bhopal Principles on Corporate Accountability and Liability, a comprehensive set of principles to ensure that corporations protect human rights, food sovereignty and promote clean and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles referer directly to the world's worst chemical disaster, in Bhopal in 1984, which destroyed the lives of thousands of people who were exposed to lethal gases leaking from a Union Carbide chemical plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Earth Summit must address corporate liablility, said Furtado. "By turning a blind eye to this issue in the WSSD, governments are surrendering the welfare of the public to the mercy of corporate criminals."&lt;/p&gt;

	An armed ship prepares to depart Japan with a deadly cargo of plutonium waste.  A sailboat sets out from an offshore windfarm.  Which one of these vessels will represent the energy future of the world?
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, at wind farm in Horns Rev.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story about two ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is a huge cargo ship being loaded in Japan, where
guardswith machine guns patrol its deck. It is preparing to sail
away with adeadly cargo of 225 kilograms of plutonium. The ship's
owners live infear that as little as five kilograms might be stolen
to create anuclear nightmare. Environmentalists live in fear that a
fire orcollision or storm could breach the hull and contaminate a
living oceanfor thousands of years. In nearly every port in every
country the shippasses through, local residents live in fear for
their seas and theirlivelihoods. There will be protest all along
the route, which the shipwill ignore, a gun turret menacing from
its decks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other ship is a sailboat, with bright sails and bearing a
peacedove on its bow. It's the Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow
Warrior. Half aworld away off the coast of Denmark, it is sailing
through a sunlitocean dotted with wind turbines like the ones all
over Europe that arequietly generating more than 4,700 megawatts of
energy. There's not agun in site. There are no worries about a
deadly accident spillingnuclear waste into the sea, no fear of
terrorists hijacking the rawmaterial for nuclear bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these represents our world's energy future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear waste ship is being loaded with plutonium waste as
partof a vast expansion of the nuclear industry's plans for nuclear
fuelreprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reprocessing involves separating plutonium from old fuel.
Japaneseelectrical utilities have signed contracts for reprocessing
their spentnuclear reactor fuel in Europe. But the same plutonium
that can fuel anuclear reactor can also make a nuclear bomb. The
world already has toomuch plutonium, and in the post-September 11th
world, shipping itacross the globe is... well, let's just call it
foolhardy. Theprojected total stocks of plutonium will amount to
over 145,000kilograms by 2020 if the currently proposed
reprocessing contracts arenot stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Clements, one of our anti-nuclear campaigners who is
opposingthe shipment, has said that "if industry and government
plans proceed,the narrow straits between Korea and Japan are about
to become aplutonium freeway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offshore wind could supply over a third of the electricity needs
forcountries bordering the North Sea within a generation. Perhaps
you'dlike to read that sentence again -- it's one of those facts
that a fewof us have been shouting for decades now, and which the
nuclearindustry doesn't want you to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of continuing to shout this kind of fact,
ourflagship, the Rainbow Warrior, began Greenpeace's Choose
PositiveEnergy tour at Horns Rev, the world's largest offshore wind
park thatis being built in Danish waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace UK Executive Director Stephen
Tinsdale,"there needs to be a massive expansion of renewable energy
supplies inthe northern industrialised countries to make renewable
energy costeffective enough to take off in southern countries. The
North Sea isset to be the cradle of the global renewables
revolution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind energy is competitive with coal and gas power generation
andclearly beats the more expensive nuclear power. This is one of
the mainconclusions of &lt;a href="http://a520.g.akamai.net/7/520/1534/release1.0/web.greenpeace.org/multimedia/download/1/14637/0/wind-force-12-2002.pdf"&gt;
'Wind Force 12',&lt;/a&gt; arecent report produced by Greenpeace and the
European Wind EnergyAssociation. The UK government's energy review
projected that windenergy will be the cheapest energy source by
2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 4,700MW of wind power was installed onshore in the
EuropanUnion last year - producing as much electricity as two large
nuclearreactors. By the end of this year, another 6,000MW will be
added and afurther growth of 30-40 percent per year is
expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has a chance to choose alternative energy when the
EarthSummit commences in Johannesburg in less than sixty days.
There,Greenpeace is calling for the world's governments to take the
followingchallenge: get clean energy into the hands of two billion
people whoare without electricity within ten years. With existing
and imminentadvances in solar and wind technologies, that goal is
entirelyachievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do we choose to send deadly plutonium half way around
theworld when one of the answers to our energy needs is blowing in
thewind?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today President Mbeki of South Africa travels to deliver this
message to the G-8 Summit being held near Calgary, Canada. He will
say that rich countries, especially the USA, Canada and Japan, must
also fully engage in global efforts to build upon the legacy of Rio
(1992) and Stockholm (1972), and that they must deliver concrete
action plans for poverty alleviation, environmental protection and
sustainable economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Energy Initiative, which calls for a global target
of 10 percent of global energy supply from new renewable energy
sources by 2010, is exactly the kind of result that we need from
Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've been searching for champions for this process, and now
we've found them," said Steve Sawyer of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With only 62 days until the start of the Johannesburg Summit,
it's going to be an uphill struggle, but we believe that President
Mbeki, with strong support from President Cardoso and Prime
Minister Persson, are up to the task."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We'll be anxiously awaiting the results of the G-8 Summit in
Canada, and hope that President Mbeki succeeds in bringing the G-8
members into the process in a serious way."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and WWF called upon the Earth Summit leaders to stick
to their promises. The past year of preparations for the World
Summit on Sustainable Development have been characterised by slow
and frustrating negotiations. The clear message from the three
leaders, echoed by UK Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, was that
'the world cannot afford failure in Johannesburg', and that they
would do everything in their power to ensure that it is a
success.&lt;/p&gt;

            Former main street in Muslyumovo, near the Techa River, severely contaminated with radioactive waste from Mayak nuclear complex.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minatom, Russia's cash-strapped nuclear ministry, wants to
import 20,000 tones of spent nuclear fuel in a deal it believes
will make US$ 21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the deal has been criticized by Yuriy Vishnevskiy, head of
the nuclear regulator Gosatomnadzor. In an extremely frank letter
to head of Minatom, Alexander Rumyantsev, Vishnevskiy condemns the
decision on both safety and economic grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the letter, which has been obtained by Greenpeace, the
regulator comments on a Minatom submission to President Putin that
details Russia's readiness to "import, store and reprocess foreign
spent fuel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosatomnadzor´s Yuriy Vishnevskiy warns that "a wrong conclusion
has been made on the existence in the Russian Federation of the
necessary administrative and technical possibilities as well as
sufficient regulatory basis for the acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel (SNF) from foreign reactors; the profit from the acceptance
has been calculated incorrectly and it contains a number of
incorrect claims."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minatom's dangerous plans to turn Russia into the world's
nuclear dump should now be abandoned, as "only a fool would ignore
the regulators warning," said Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Tobias
Muenchmeyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While it is possible that the Russian government will ignore
the advice of its nuclear regulator we urge the so-called client
countries to heed the warning and send Minatom's emissaries
packing," said Muenchmeyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter comes 11 days after Greenpeace launched a major photo
exhibition in Moscow that reveals the human cost of nuclear waste
dumping at Mayak, the world's largest nuclear complex. Should the
Minatom proposal succeed, Mayak is a likely site for more nuclear
waste dumping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;More information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the letter, and learn about the Mayak exhibit and the
severe nuclear contamination that already harms the people and
landscape of Russia, at a special Greenpeace website called &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/mayak"&gt;Half Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Brazil has a golden opportunity to take advantage of its status as a top world soya producer that does not permit genetically engineered (GE) crops, says a new Greenpeace report.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/greenpeace-activists-put-pile.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Non-GE soya. Brazil can capitalize on its GE-free status, report says.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's non-GE status has already gained the country market
shares and premiums because of the increased demand for GE-free
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Europe's anticipated shift to non-GE animal feed, and the
Asian food market's rising demand for GE free crops, Brazilian
exporters can expect increased demand for their food products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace report was launched as a delegation of European
meat producers arrived in Brazil to secure non-GE supplies for the
future. However, the report also comes at a time when Brazil might
reconsider its non-GE status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Brazil has a great opportunity now to dominate a multimillion
dollar market by exporting only non-GE soya, maize and meat," said
Mariana Paoli of Greenpeace Brazil. "It would be contrary to good
business sense to quit the game while being ahead. Brazil is the
forerunner in a non-GE market that is booming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of GE soya in the US, the volume of US
soyabean exports to Europe has dropped from 9.2 million tonnes in
1996 to 6.8 million tonnes in 2000 while Brazilian non-GE soyabean
exports to Europe have increased from 3.1 million tonnes to 6.3
million tonnes. US maize and Canadian canola/rapeseed have suffered
even more dramatic market losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in Brazil believe that the country can grow both GE and
non-GE varieties of crops, and allow producers to supply whichever
their customers ask for. Experience in the US and Canada shows that
such an approach is extremely expensive. Even companies that go to
the expense of keeping commodities separate still risk that the
segregation systems will go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean-François Fauconnier, Greenpeace market specialist said,
"You can´t do both: GE crops contaminate conventional crops and
handling systems and drive up the costs of production throughout
the sector."&lt;/p&gt;

	The genetic contamination of maize in Mexico's Oaxaca state is a serious hazard for biodiversity in this region, a world centre of genetic diversity for the crop. Now a commission of NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) has agreed to study the problem.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/10/landraces-varieties-of-mexican.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Genetic contamination threatens biodiversity of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico, the world centre of diversity for this important crop.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes after indigenous communities from Oaxaca,
along with Greenpeace and three other NGOs filed a request under
Article 13 of the North American Agreement on Environmental
Cooperation (NAAEC), the NAFTA environmental side agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision by NAFTA's Commission for Environmental
Cooperation (CEC) publicly recognises the gravity of the situation
in Mexico, where over 300 locally cultivated and wild maize
varieties are threatened by genetic contamination. This
contamination most likely originated from US-imported GE maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case also creates a precedent, because this is the first
time that an environmental oversight body of an international trade
agreement will address environmental damage caused by genetically
engineered (GE) crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector Magallón, genetic engineering campaigner for Mexico
pointed out that, "The Mexican Government has known about this
contamination for almost a year and hasn't done anything to stop it
from spreading or solve the problem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico should require segregation of GE and conventional maize,
and ban the import of GE maize from the United States. Recognition
of the seriousness of this issue should also prompt calls for
identification of the companies responsible for the transgenic
pollution, and compensation for local affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;

	ExxonMobil is worried about the reputation of its brand, and is attempting to sue Greenpeace to protect it.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace StopEsso campaign.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not worried about the fact that it has tried to convince
the public that global warming isn't happening. It's not worried
about getting criticism because it has sabotaged international
climate agreements. Nor has it expressed concern that it has chosen
to prioritise selling more petrol over scientific warnings of
famine, floods, and disease for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worried that Greenpeace is making fun of its logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It thinks that Greenpeace is deliberately trying to create "a
repulsion, which turns away customers from the ESSO brand" by
swapping two letters in its brand with dollar signs. It is even
suggesting that Greenpeace is attempting to draw a connection
between the world's biggest climate criminal and "the infamous
SS."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a suit filed with the French courts over Greenpeace's use of
the Esso logo, the corporation is demanding a penalty of 80
thousand euros for reputational damage and 80 thousand euros a day
per logo should Greenpeace fail to comply. It also demands removal
of all use of the term "StopEsso".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StopEsso, a coalition of groups including Greenpeace, is
campaigning around the world to stop ExxonMobil from sabotaging
international action to address climate change, such as the Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French website over which ExxonMobil wants to sue, is one of
&lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;several StopEsso sites&lt;/a&gt;
globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Greenpeace Gerd Leipold says that
Greenpeace is not backing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is just ridiculous. Esso knows it can't win a debate about
climate change, and it won't discuss the content of the website.
Instead Esso is trying to gag us with legal threats. We will fight
this in court."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A initial legal decision is expected around the 6-7th of
July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Greenpeace agrees that the public's repulsion
with the Esso brand should not be based on a logo. It should be
based on the facts of ExxonMobil's record of endangering our
future. Therefore, we encourage readers to join in discussions at
&lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/"&gt;StopEsso.org&lt;/a&gt; and encourage
others to do so by taking the action listed below and informing
friends of the issue using the ecard links in the side bar to the
right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell Exxon &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=esso_int2&amp;amp;s=blue2s"&gt;what
you think&lt;/a&gt; of its climate policy and decision to sue Greenpeace

	Today one hundred activists in the important German harbour of Nordenham protested the import of timber from ancient forests.

            Greenpeace activists in Nordenham paint 'Save Ancient Forests Now' on logs stored at the port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists climbed the unloading cranes of the harbour and
unfurled flags that read, "G8 Save the Ancient Forests Now." At the
same time, more than 80 activists painted the same message on the
logs stored at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protests continue Greenpeace efforts to put the spotlight on
the plight of ancient forests, during the G8 meeting in Kananaskis,
Canada. G8 governments continue to allow illegal timber and timber
products into their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christoph Thies of Greenpeace said, "In 1998, the G8 committed
to fight illegal logging and protect forests. But four years on,
the G8's Action Programme on Forests has been quietly buried, while
it's business as usual in the world's last ancient forests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Illegal logging is as high as 80 percent in some forest
nations, deforestation rates are higher than ever - and industrial
logging remains the single most important factor in driving that
destruction," Thies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the heads of G8 Governments,
representing some of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the most powerful players on the planet, not to let their Action
Programme on Forests die, but to use their influence at both the G8
Summit next week, and the Earth Summit itself, to halt ancient
forest destruction, hold accountable the corporations responsible,
and implement sustainable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

the boxes highlight the commercial reality of so-called
"scientific" whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, a "whale meat" delivery van pulled up in front
of the Japanese Embassy. Whale meat boxes where used to build a
wall that said, "Whales are NOT for Sale" on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, Greenpeace unloaded truckloads of whale meat boxes,
and stacked them in front of the Japanese embassy. Yesterday, in
Austria, 80 protestors sporting white uniforms and white painted
faces shouldered their burden of whale tails and whale meat boxes
on sticks and stood in silent vigil in front of the Japanese
embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, a petition signed by marine and cetacean biologists
from around the world calling upon the government to end its
scientific whaling was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. In Australia, there was a display of Butoh dancing by
artists in white body paint on a red carpet in front of the
Japanese consulate in Sydney. Butoh combines modern and traditional
Japanese dance styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protests will continue in other countries throughout the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory: shale oil project collapses</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/shale-oil-victory/</url><text>
	In a world which holds more oil than we can safely burn, why would anyone try to squeeze more out of rocks? And in a world threatened by climate change, why would anyone make a bad fossil fuel even WORSE for the environment by using tremendous amounts of energy to crush the rock and heat it to 500 degrees Celsius, while rotating it in a giant kiln?  Only a complete idiot -- or Queensland Energy Resources (QER) of Australia -- would try such a thing.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/7/activist-holding-banner-clima.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist holding banner pointing out climate change impact of shale oil project.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the announcement today that QER was ending oil development
of the Stuart Shale near Gladstone, the Australian government must
now decide whether to give up entirely on the ill-fated
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning to stop the development of shale
oil, the most greenhouse intensive of all fossil fuels, since 1998.
We weren't alone. In a year 2000 editorial, New Scientist opined
"We face a switch either to clean energy sources or to fuels even
dirtier than today's, such as shale oil. It beggars belief that
anyone would choose the latter."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stuart Shale oil project in Australia has been controversial
since its inception over two decades ago. It has cost more than AU$
360 million, including tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers'
money. Even so, QER CEO Ross Dunning tried to make the best of the
closure by declaring the project a success: "Over the past several
years Stage 1 has produced over 1.5 million barrels of oil."
Eureka! It's feasible to produce oil from rocks at great
environmental expense and with devastating toxic side effects and
not be able to make a profit even with huge government
subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shale oil should not be developed at any price. Oil from Stuart
would have had four times the greenhouse emission impact of oil
extracted from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, former partner Suncor pulled out of the Stuart project
amid concerns about its commercial viability and environmental
impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queensland Energy Resources, a company that grew out of that
failure, said the project would wind down over the next few months,
a major victory for the tens of thousands of people who took action
with Greenpeace in opposing the Stuart Shale project, from our
global cyberactivists to the local residents who opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets let this be a lesson to other governments which think
they can develop oil at any cost, and to companies like &lt;a href="http://www.exxonsecrets.org/"&gt;Exxon which continue to fund
phony science and political lobbyists&lt;/a&gt; to convince us that
global warming is not a problem: we're not going to let you
win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than propping up polluting industries such as shale oil,
governments should help develop clean, renewable energy and fuels
such as solar and wind power, and hydrogen fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should leave squeezing rocks to idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk. In 2002 the reef
experienced its worst case of coral bleaching, with over 60 percent
being affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the climate heats up so do the oceans, causing the organisms
that give coral its colour and food to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government now faces a key decision on the reef's
future - accepting or rejecting the second stage of the Stuart
Shale Oil project near Gladstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of a shale oil industry would more than double
Australia's greenhouse emissions - increasing climate change. This
would be a disaster for the reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=934&amp;amp;s=blue2"&gt;Tell
the Queensland government to abandon shale oil development
permanently.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace Jaguars are leaping into action: activists on motorbikes are stopping bulldozers from destroying forest lands in Salta, Argentina.  Cyberactivists around the world are picking up the phone and calling the Argentine embassies in their countries to demand a moratorium on forest destruction to stop the killing of rare wildlife and displacement of forest peoples.  Your help is urgently needed: you can be a Greenpeace Jaguar with a telephone and three minutes of your time.

        &lt;p&gt;
            You can help save jaguars in Argentina with a phone call supporting our action right now.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, July 26th, nine Greenpeace activists, including five
'jaguars', located bulldozers in Salta, on the border of the Great
Chaco and Yungas forests. They climbed onto the machines and used
chains to lock them. Days later, these bulldozers are still
immobilized, and other 'jaguars' are on the prowl for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Update August 1st: The Greenpeace
Jaguars have left the forest for now, but we'll be back. The
campaign won't end until we have a moratorium on forest
destruction. Your &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/greenpeacejaguars/ciber.htm"&gt;phone
call&lt;/a&gt; can still help pressure the president of Argentina to take
positive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update July 30th: In Argentina, the government has been turning
off their phone exchanges. In the forest, bulldozer operators
stopped their operations and attempted to hide their equipment to
avoid our motorbiking activists. And embassies the world over
continued to field calls from cyberactivists and try to route them
toward email responses to lessen the administrative burden. Here's
a sample of the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/greenpeacejaguars/press.htm"&gt;press
coverage the action has been getting the world over, along with
high-resolution images and news from the forest.&lt;/a&gt; But what has
the president of Argentina done to ensure a moratorium?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="greenpeace jaguars in action in argentina." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="64451"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Update
July 29th: During their latest prowl our jaguars tracked down five
more bulldozers clear cutting and burning the forest. Using their
motorbikes they intercepted the bulldozers and blocked their path
to the forest thus ending today's planned destruction. The machines
have been locked up with chains and 'Blocked by Greenpeace' is now
stamped on all the diggers. Monday's bulldozers are also still
locked up so, all in all, our prowlers have managed to immobilize
eight bulldozers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update July 28th: The Jaguars have now been at it for more than
72 hours -- they have immobilized bulldozers, sparked press
attention in Argentina, and been supported by more than &lt;b&gt;5000
phone calls&lt;/b&gt; to Argentine embassies the world over. The
Argentine embassy in the UK reported to one caller they'd had 14
calls in a half hour about the issue: let's keep the pressure
up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are some excerpts from the
message which our activist Emiliano sent to our cyberactivists
worldwide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="2"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25920/motoweb1.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Greenpeace activist"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we're off! The motorbike-riding Greenpeace Jaguars have just
gone into action. The bulldozers are moving in, but the volunteers
on their motorbikes are blocking them. We're stopping them from
destroying the whole forest!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;I need you to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading3"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/greenpeacejaguars"&gt; join the Greenpeace Jaguars &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from wherever you are right now. Please, don't wait even a
minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call your Argentine embassy now, and ask that the President of
Argentina, Néstor Kirchner, introduce a moratorium on
deforestation. Then please let us know what the embassy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading3"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/greenpeacejaguars/ciber.htm"&gt;Click here and find the phone number of the Argentine embassy in your country.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, 75 percent of our native forests have already
disappeared, and every hour the equivalent of 20 football pitches
(soccer fields, for you North Americans) of forest is destroyed to
grow transgenic soya. The damage is irreversible, it is almost
impossible to grow forest on the soil again - and today an area the
size of Germany is at risk. In the last month, a provincial
government has already sold off a natural reserve to companies
planning to sow genetically engineered (GE) soya, an unprecedented
act. This cannot carry on! That's why the Greenpeace Jaguars have
gone into action to defend north-west Argentina's remaining
forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also asking if you could send on this email to your closest
contacts and friends, to those who share with you the desire to
defend the forest, in every corner of the world. The participation
via email of many people like you has succeeded before in stopping
other cases of deforestation. This time too, we're going to
win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help us. The destruction of the forests in north-west
Argentina means the loss of thousands of animal and plant species,
the degredation of the soil and its contamination thanks to the use
of pesticides, as well as hundreds of indigenous and local people
losing their homes.&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25920/emiliano.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Emiliano in the forest"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask President Kirchner to declare a moratorium on deforestation
for the entire country! I know I can count on your
participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Emiliano Ezcurra&lt;br&gt;Forest Campaign Coordinator&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Argentina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're here to stop these jaguar forests being destroyed and the
land turned into a genetically engineered soya desert," Emiliano
said from the Yungas forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;People being evicted, going hungry, for European steak and hamburgers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yungas Rainforest and the Great Chaco American forest are
two neighbouring ecosystems. They are rich in biodiversity and
wildlife, such as rare jaguars. They are being destroyed at one of
the fastest rates in the world -- in order to grow soya for animal
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest had been destroyed for agriculture for years, but the
rate of destruction has accelerated since 1996, when Monsanto
introduced GE soya beans into Argentina. Since then, the country
has extended its agricultural frontiers to grow GE soya for export
as animal feed, at the expense of its threatened forests, wildlife
and the homes and livelihoods of many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Greenpeace jaguars in action in Argentina with local indigenous peoples." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="64454"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Ramón
Ferriera, who lives in the Great Chaco forest, said: "They force us
to leave our land, often with guns. Then they come with these
powerful machines, knock down all the trees, burn them and plant
soya. We see no economic benefit from such great destruction and we
lose all we have."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emiliano Ezcurra says "People go hungry while their land is used
to grow soya to feed cows, pigs and chickens... This environmental
and social abuse is totally unacceptable. The Argentinean
Government must stop the forest destruction and give people who
live in the forest the legal right to their land."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span class="heading3"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/greenpeacejaguars/ciber.htm"&gt;Call the Argentine embassy in your country now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace reveals bribery at Danzer Group</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/danzer-group-illegal-logging-e/</url><text>
	We knew they were dodgy, and now we have proof of just HOW dodgy ... today Greenpeace published an investigation into Swiss/German logging company The Danzer Group, which shows hard evidence of illegal logging, bribery and the defrauding of developing countries.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/gorilla-seated-looking-at-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/gorilla-seated-looking-at-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Don't try and buy me out of MY forest!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence we obtained includes a memo written by one of the
executive directors of The Danzer Group who states that "If there
is any threat of a fine, so called conditioned cases, he is,
however prepared to take care of this by giving a gift". We guess
he's not talking about a nice pen and letter-opener set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Danzer Group has got itself into even more trouble by
teaming up with Cameroonian company Mba Mba Georges (MMG). Further
juicy documents from Danzer indicate that MMG has been logging
illegally inside their own logging area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Illegal logging is not only destroying Africa's rainforest and
wiping out precious wildlife habitat, but companies involved in
this activity also appear to be defrauding developing nations and
local communities out of millions of dollars through the systematic
bribery of public officials," said Gavin Edwards of Greenpeace
International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that you don't really have much choice about
whether or not The Danzer Group makes profits on all of this
corruption ... they currently sell African rainforest timber
throughout Europe, with some suspected illegal wood being found in
bridge construction projects by local governments, including in
France and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customs officers can't act to stop the import of illegal forest
products into Europe, because there is no EU legislation in place
as yet to stop this illicit trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This problem needs more than discussion and study, it needs
swift action," said Sebastien Risso, of Greenpeace EU Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This means stronger monitoring and law enforcement in African
countries, EU legislation to prevent illegal wood imports, and the
prosecution of these crooks under existing bribery laws," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80 percent of the world's ancient forests have already been
degraded or destroyed, and only 20 percent remain intact. The
rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville,
Central African Republic, Cameroon and Gabon are quickly being
logged and turned into forest products for the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are simply failing to protect ancient
forests from illegal and destructive logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Nukes out of NATO</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/nukes-out-of-nato/</url><text>
	The NATO summit and its attendant world leaders rolled into Istanbul this week. While the rhetoric is of peace, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) version includes a constant nuclear threat. We are highlighting the military alliance's hypocrisy in trying to 'make peace' using the threat of nuclear weapons.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/6/despite-unprecedented-security.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Despite unprecedented security measures, Greenpeace activists unfurled a banner off the Bosphorous Bridge to protest against NATO's irrational nuclear policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To send the message home Greenpeace Mediterranean activists hung
a massive banner from the Bosphorous Bridge for all the delegates
to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"NATO is the world's largest military nuclear alliance. It is
about 'keeping the peace' through a threat - the threat of using
nuclear weapons- and threats are the least likely way to achieve
peace and stability in the world," said Nicky Davies from
Greenpeace. The expansion of NATO to 26 member nations reaffirms
the importance of NATO countries starting the process of nuclear
disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have consistently campaigned for a world free of nuclear
weapons. The US, Britain and France possess over 10,000 nuclear
weapons. There are also over 150 nuclear bombs placed in six NATO
member states, including Turkey, provided by the US and assigned
for use by NATO. Use our &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/wmd/"&gt;'zoom on doom' map&lt;/a&gt; to
discover which countries have nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, some countries have been able to say no to NATO coercion:
Denmark, Norway and Spain have made a conscious decision to not
allow the deployment of NATO nuclear weapons on their territories,
and Greece has successfully requested the removal of the nuclear
arms in its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1971, 184 countries made a commitment to achieve complete
nuclear disarmament under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
More than thirty years later, nuclear disarmament still has not
been achieved. To the contrary, the US Administration now justifies
the use of nuclear weapons first, even in conventional conflict,
rather than only when threatened with a nuclear strike, the world
is more at risk from nuclear conflict than at any time since the
Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As NATO nuclear policy traditionally mirrors that of the US,
leaders of NATO member countries, meeting for the first time this
morning, must send a clear message to the US Administration that
this time NATO will not follow in its footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the leaders of the world's most powerful nations feel they
have come to Istanbul to promote peace here on the bridge between
Europe and Asia in the way the vast majority of Europeans demand,
they will do so by saying no to Bush's nuclear doctrine, no to NATO
nuclear weapons altogether, and no to the concept that deadly
nuclear arms can in any way promote peace," said Ozgur Gurbuz from
Greenpeace Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite unprecedented security measures, Greenpeace activists
unfurled a banner off the Bosphorous Bridge to protest against
NATO's irrational nuclear policy.&lt;/p&gt;

	What does the US have to hide about radioactive materials flown out of Iraq?  Why has the international community not been allowed to monitor the secret airlift which the US has just confirmed? Where is the inventory accounting for nuclear materials that have been found to date?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/girl-standing-outside-the-al-m-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Girl standing outside the Al-Majidat school for girls where Greenpeace identified and quarantined radioactive materials.  The US government rushed to secure oil production facilities in Iraq, leaving an enriched uranium storage facility unguarded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has removed "roughly 1000 highly radioactive sources" and
enriched uranium from Iraq in a secret airlift, according to a
statement by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. "It just ain't good
enough to say 'roughly 1000' when talking about highly radioactive
sources" said Greenpeace activist Mike Townsley. "The IAEA has been
trying for over a year to get access to these materials and been
denied."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reports suggest that the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) was "informed," though it appears that the strict
regulations requiring inspectors to be present and a full inventory
of items be provided, have been ignored by the US. One of the
reasons that the US went to war in the first place was the
allegation that Saddam Hussein's was refusing to cooperate with
IAEA inspectors or comply with international regulations regarding
nuclear materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/iraq" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace entered and inspected the main
storage&lt;/a&gt; facility for these materials in Tuwaitha one year ago,
and revealed that while US forces had immediately secured oil
production facilities, Tuwaitha remained unguarded for more than
six weeks. Local residents looted radioactive barrels and building
materials for use in their homes. Greenpeace inspectors found one
source kicking out &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/iraq/archives/000479.html"&gt;10,000
times background&lt;/a&gt; radiation in the home of one Tuwaitha
resident, and a source of &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/iraq/archives/000485.html"&gt;3,000
times background&lt;/a&gt; outside a school where children were
playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want a full inventory of the removed materials" said
Townsley, who led the Greenpeace team in Tuwaitha, "and full
authority over the materials given to the IAEA."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The US government has lied, bullied, and bullshitted their way
into this war, and I see no reason why anyone should trust them to
do the right or safe thing with nuclear materials. The
international community can have no confidence US government
assurances that the inventory of radioactive industrial isotope is
complete."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a job for the IAEA and the US ought to be setting an
example of compliance with the full international regulations
concerning nuclear weapons proliferation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials in question are not capable of creating a nuclear
bomb, though some of the more highly radioactive sources could be
packed around a conventional explosive to create a "dirty
bomb."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is calling the operation a "major achievement" in keeping
nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists. However, in
failing to secure the material during the invasion hundreds of
local residents were exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity.
US military personell broke IAEA seals that had been securing some
of the material for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, nuclear material from Iraq has been found in
both the Netherlands and Turkey, showing that nuclear material can
and does leave the country, leading to possible pathways to
terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reasons that the world has drawn up strict regulations
about handling and transporting nuclear materials. The US is not
immune to those rules, and ought to be on the front line of
ensuring that nuclear materials are fully accounted for, monitored,
and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi government needs to do what Paul Bremmer and
Washington could not; rejoin the international non-proliferation
community and allow the IAEA free access to all of its nuclear
facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

	Home to one of the most endangered tree species in the world, the Californian wolverine and salamanders, the ancient forests of the US Pacific Northwest are a unique treasure. Unfortunately they are also on the Bush administration's logging hit list to be sold off to corporate big business. We are out to stop this destruction.

	The Bush administration has trashed US clean air laws by allowing power stations to install new equipment without adding pollution controls, and permitting coal-fired power plants to continue to release tons of mercury. This dirty energy also wreaks havoc on the environment, causing global warming, acid rain, and smog. That's why our activists are 700ft up a chimney in Pennsylvania to call for clean energy now!
&lt;div&gt;

            Activists climb a 700-ft coal plant smokestack to denounce Bush's dirty power plan. The Hatfield's Ferry Power Station is a symbol and an example of the Bush administration's dirty energy policy that favors polluting fossil fuels over clean energy sources.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists from Greenpeace USA have scaled the coal plant
smokestack at Hatfield's Ferry Power Station this morning to
denounce Bush's dirty power plan. Hatfield's Ferry Power Station in
Masontown, Pennsylvania was under investigation by the Justice
Department for violating the Clean Air Act - an investigation that
was dropped by the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua is one of the activists who scaled the stack: "President
Bush allows dirty power plants like Hatsfield Ferry to continue to
spew out poison, which pollutes our bodies, our water and air. We
need a commitment to clean energy like solar and wind to provide us
with safe and secure energy for the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Arial view of the banner on smokestack" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="62163"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"This
smokestack is a symbol of President Bush's dirty energy plan," said
Terri Swearingen, a long time environmental activist and registered
nurse. "As a mother whose daughter attends college and lives less
than 15 miles from here, I am outraged that President Bush has
blocked efforts to clean up this plant and others like it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hatsfield Ferry is an exceedingly dirty coal-burning power
plant. Owned by Allegheny Energy, this plant ranks as one of the
worst polluters in the country, violating environmental standards
and causing numerous health problems including premature death.
However, thanks to extensive Republican Party contributions, this
plant is permitted to continue on its dirty energy path without
consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

	Charoen Wataksorn was murdered by gunmen outside his home in Thailand on June 22. Charoen was an experienced activist who worked closely with us in the successful battle against proposed coal power stations in Bo Nok and Ban Krut. He was unswerving in his dedication despite numerous threats against him and his family. He was murdered shortly after testifying to a parliamentary committee against powerful figures involved in community land grabs.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Charoen Wataksorn worked closely with Greenpeace during the campaign against the proposed coal fired power stations in Bo Nok and Ban Krut, Thailand. He continued to oppose the power plants despite numerous threats against him and his family.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charoen, a humble, popular 38 year old returned home to the
breezy palm trees and tranquil paddy fields of coastal Prachuap
Khiri Khan province after telling senators in Bangkok how local
officials were colluding to transfer public land in Bo Nok to a
local strongman. By the end of the night he was dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight against the land grab was the latest in Chareon's
ongoing battle to preserve the local environment. The successful
campaign to stop the dirty coal plants of Bo Nok and Ban Krut was
lead by Chareon in an incredible example of grassroots organising.
It is the story of a whole community fighting back against large
industrial projects, corruption and bad investments that threaten
the local people, communities and the environment. It is an
inspiration for the whole environmental movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly this is not an isolated case. Almost on a daily basis,
many community activists, mostly from poor villages in developing
countries, face this kind of a threat from vested interests. Sadly,
similar cases have gone unreported. This is why we are publicising
the struggle of southern environmental activists as epitomized by
Charoen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This community's struggle against coal projects has travelled
the world, inspiring many communities including the Pulupandan
community in Negros, Philippines to resist dirty energy
development. Those who have won their local battles now support
other battles. We pay tribute to Charoen and to the many
communities out there who continue to struggle against unsuitable
development in order to protect the sustainability of their
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Turning point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cancellation of these two coal-fired power plants marked the
turning point in Thailand's clean energy future. Had these plants
been built, Thailand would be importing coal from Indonesia and
Australia, fuelling global warming and racking up huge debts. Now,
the country has domestic options ranging from greater energy
efficiency to developing new renewable electricity sources for its
energy needs. Charoen also led in this area, helping to install a
solar power system on the temple where he lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, this campaign is probably the first time ever that two
major coal power plants have not been developed once the companies
involved had committed to them. It was not an easy victory! The
proponents of the Bo Nok plant spent millions on greenwashing their
proposal with misleading adverts in national newspapers about
'Clean Coal'. They also got the US Ambassador to threaten
Thailand's government with 'capital flight' and divestment if such
major projects were cancelled. In the struggle to stop global
warming, reducing the uptake of coal in economies that largely
exist without it is key. Coal is a fuel of the past - renewable
energy is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, Charoen represents a community that has chosen a path
towards a clean energy future for themselves and future
generations. In our hearts, we will always carry Charoen's courage,
and continue the fight for a clean and healthy environment we all
could live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org//1089106847"&gt;Read a tribute
to Charoen&lt;/a&gt; from one of our former campaigners who worked with
him in the campaign against the coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

	Unilever, Coca Cola and McDonalds have promised to phase out climate-killing chemicals in their refrigeration equipment. This announcement shows that refrigeration can be climate friendly. However other corporations and governments continue to promote or lobby for increased use of climate-wrecking gases.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Production of more environmentally friendly Greenfreeze refrigerators in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced the
banning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration industry
switched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While this stopped depletion
of the ozone layer, it meant introducing a new potent greenhouse
gas. It was an environmental case of "out of the frying pan into
the fire."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch and show how it should
be done we launched the concept of Greenfreeze in 1992. We met two
scientists who pointed out how to avoid HFC's altogether. We found
an old fridge factory, appealed to our supporters to pre-order
enough units to finance a refit, helped build the market and
Greenfreeze was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
and fuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never work and the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in the industry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there are over 100 million Greenfreeze refrigerators in
the world, produced by all the major European, Chinese, Japanese
and Indian manufacturers. It is now available in most major markets
with the exception of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in the
domestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued to use refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to the Sydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such as Unilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors,
to live up to the guidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after being faced with a &lt;a href="http://www.cokespotlight.org/"&gt;concerted internet campaign&lt;/a&gt;
before the 2000 Olympics to buy green refrigeration for new units.
Before the start of the games all three companies announced phase
out plans for damaging refrigeration technologies by the time of
the 2004 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these companies have announced more concrete plans for how
to phase out HFC's. Our Executive Director, Gerd Leipold welcomed
the announcement: "Greenpeace welcomes the commitments made by
Unilever, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. We call on their competitors,
such as Nestle, Pepsi and Burger King, to follow suit. But
corporate action is only half the picture. For a complete solution,
governments must act. Politicians can't sit back and wait for the
market to deliver, because on its own, it won't."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Under attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this good news the trend is looking bleak. Left
unchecked, by 2050 HFC's will do as much damage to the climate as
the traffic fumes of all the world's passenger cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To force all companies and industry to meet the high standards
of these three companies effective government regulation is the
only solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly even the current ineffective regulation of HFC's is
under attack. American industry is leading the charge for wider use
of HFC's in uses such as car air conditioners. Ford motor company
is one example of a pro-HFC's corporation. Like the US chemicals
industries meddling in new European Union chemical law, the
"European" industry lobby group for HFC's was actually set up in US
state of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The way ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies like McDonalds, Unilever and Coca Cola, who are far
from 'all round environmental angels', can go HFC free then there
is no reason why their competitors cannot follow their lead. It
also exposes the lies and misinformation spread by irresponsible
industry lobbying. Goverments should follow the progressive stance
of these three companies and adopt an immediate phase-out of
HFCs.&lt;/p&gt;

	The government of India has finally bowed to pressure and agreed to allow a US Court to possibly rule that Dow Chemical should clean up the site of the ongoing Bhopal disaster. Mounting pressure from three determined hunger strikers, intensive lobbying by us, other Bhopal groups and thousands of online activists helped turn round the position of the Indian government.

            Union Carbide accident survivor's weekly meeting, Bhopal, India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This statement brings us one step closer to a historic order by the US Court directing Union Carbide (now owned by Dow) to clean up the toxic contamination in and around the factory premises in Bhopal," said Satinath Sarangi, Bhopal activist and one of those on hunger strike. "Such an Order will not only uphold the 'Polluter Pays' principle, but will set a precedence to hold multinational companies accountable in their home country for their actions abroad."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 people have been affected by the serious contamination emanating from the tonnes of toxic chemicals and chemical waste dumped in and around the Union Carbide factory premises. They, and their supporters from around the world, now expect the US District Court to order Union Carbide to clean up the contamination at Bhopal to the best global standards possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that the Prime Minister who intervened in this matter will show the same kind of sensitivity and alacrity in dealing with other pending issues in Bhopal and in holding Union Carbide's new owner Dow Chemicals liable for the pending issues in Bhopal," said Rasheeda Bi, winner of the Goldman Prize 2004, who has also been on hunger strike since June 18th along with Mr Shahid Noor, who was orphaned by the gas leak in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people also urged action from the Indian government from our online action, thank you to everyone who took part in this and other actions. Hundreds of Bhopal supporters, who have also been on hunger strike in solidarity with the three activists fasting in Dehli, celebrated the good news by breaking their fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The worst chemical disaster ever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bhopal disaster in 1984 is the world's worst chemical disaster ever. Toxic gas leaked from the poorly maintained and understaffed plant owned by Union Carbide. With safety systems either malfunctioning or turned off, an area of 40 square km, with a resident population of over half a million, was soon covered with a dense cloud of MIC gas. People woke in their homes to fits of coughing, their lungs filling with fluid. During the first three days after the accident, over 8,000 people died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the disaster, over 20,000 people have died from exposure-related illnesses, and of the approximately 520,000 people exposed to the poisonous gases, an estimated 120,000 remain chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors have never received adequate compensation for their debilitating illnesses and even almost 20 years after the disaster, the polluted site of the abandoned factory, bleeds poisons daily into the groundwater of local residents. Bhopal is an ongoing disaster and Union Carbide's new owners, Dow Chemical, should pay to clean up the toxic mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;New Hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 17 the US Court of Appeal, in a class action suit initiated by survivors' organizations and individual survivors of Bhopal, said that Union Carbide may be directed to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation "in the event that the Indian government or the State of Madhya Pradesh seeks to intervene in the action or otherwise urges the court to order such relief."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Indian government has urged the court to order the clean up we hope that the court takes the right decision and makes the polluter pay.&lt;/p&gt;

            Eighty protesters walk through Vienna to the Japanese embassy, to protest Japan's continued whaling.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made to look like the ones used by the Japanese whaling fleet,
the boxes highlight the commercial reality of so-called
"scientific" whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, a "whale meat" delivery van pulled up in front
of the Japanese Embassy. Whale meat boxes where used to build a
wall that said, "Whales are NOT for Sale" on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, Greenpeace unloaded truckloads of whale meat boxes,
and stacked them in front of the Japanese embassy. Yesterday, in
Austria, 80 protestors sporting white uniforms and white painted
faces shouldered their burden of whale tails and whale meat boxes
on sticks and stood in silent vigil in front of the Japanese
embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, a petition signed by marine and cetacean biologists
from around the world calling upon the government to end its
scientific whaling was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. In Australia, there was a display of Butoh dancing by
artists in white body paint on a red carpet in front of the
Japanese consulate in Sydney. Butoh combines modern and traditional
Japanese dance styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protests will continue in other countries throughout the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

	Research reveals that whale blubber stored in Norway awaiting export to Japan is unfit for human consumption. The samples of whale blubber studied by independent scientists in Germany are contaminated with various halogenated-organic contaminants such as PCBs, DDT and brominated flame retardants.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Ellingsen factory, biggest whale meat and blubber storage in Norway.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan and Norway have been discussing a resumption in whale
trade following Norway's decision in January 2001 to lift its ban
on whale exports. The decision was made despite the fact that this
is in contradiction to the ban imposed by the Convention on the
International Trade in Endangered Species on the trade of whale
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan applied to the Trade Ministry for
permission to import whale meat from Norway, but as yet no
shipments have been made. Norway's decision to begin exporting
whale meat and blubber to Japan has been fuelled by the desire of
the Norwegian whalers to profit from the high prices paid for whale
products on the luxury food market in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thilo Maack, Greenpeace oceans campaigner, says it would be
irresponsible of the Norwegian government to export whale blubber
to Japan and irresponsible of the Japanese government to sell it
for eating. "It is unfit for human consumption and should be
disposed of safely. If someone ate a piece of whale blubber the
size of my thumb, they would be dosing themselves many times over
the advisory limits of some of the most toxic compounds known to
humans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norwegian traders have stockpiled 1000 metric tonnes of whale
blubber in cold storage waiting for export. Last year, the Japanese
government had to put two hundred metric tonnes of unsold whale
meat and blubber in storage due to the declining market for whale
products in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report confirms the fears of environmentalists and Japanese
consumer groups that whale products are unfit for eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of such toxic chemicals in whale blubber shows the
extent to which our oceans are contaminated and underlines how
vital it is that whales are protected from hunting and that the
current international ban on trade remains intact. The status of
the minke whales hunted by Norway is uncertain and these results
show that whales are vulnerable to not only commercial whaling
activities but also to wider environmental threats.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today one hundred activists in the important German harbour of Nordenham protested the import of timber from ancient forests.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists in Nordenham paint 'Save Ancient Forests Now' on logs stored at the port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists climbed the unloading cranes of the harbour and
unfurled flags that read, "G8 Save the Ancient Forests Now." At the
same time, more than 80 activists painted the same message on the
logs stored at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protests continue Greenpeace efforts to put the spotlight on
the plight of ancient forests, during the G8 meeting in Kananaskis,
Canada. G8 governments continue to allow illegal timber and timber
products into their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christoph Thies of Greenpeace said, "In 1998, the G8 committed
to fight illegal logging and protect forests. But four years on,
the G8's Action Programme on Forests has been quietly buried, while
it's business as usual in the world's last ancient forests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Illegal logging is as high as 80 percent in some forest
nations, deforestation rates are higher than ever - and industrial
logging remains the single most important factor in driving that
destruction," Thies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the heads of G8 Governments,
representing some of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the most powerful players on the planet, not to let their Action
Programme on Forests die, but to use their influence at both the G8
Summit next week, and the Earth Summit itself, to halt ancient
forest destruction, hold accountable the corporations responsible,
and implement sustainable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two armed British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) freighters left Barrow-in-Furness in northern England this morning, setting the clock ticking on the most controversial nuclear shipment in history.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/the-two-ships-chartered-by-bnf.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/the-two-ships-chartered-by-bnf.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One of the two ships chartered by BNFL, the Pintail, departs Barrow, UK for Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they reach Japan, they will retrieve a shipment of
plutonium sufficient to build 50 nuclear bombs, to return it to
Sellafield, UK. The shipment of the mixture of plutonium-uranium
oxide (MOX) to the UK would be in defiance of both international
and UK law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UK and Japan have started the countdown to the most
controversial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nuclear shipment in history on the anniversay of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster," Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Shaun Burnie
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They could not have chosen a more fitting date to remind the
international community of the arrogance and dangerous risk-taking
of the nuclear industry".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has written to the UK government and to BNFL this
week to outline its case that the transport from Japan would be
unlawful and in breach of international agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return shipment would also violate an undertaking given by
the UK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;government to the International Law of the Sea Tribunal in
November 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a challenge against the newly approved Sellafield MOX
Plant by the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irish Government to the Tribunal, the UK told the Tribunal that
no imports of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOX fuel associated with the operations of the Sellafield MOX
Plant would go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ahead before October 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two vessels, the Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal, one
acting as an armed escort, the other carrying the plutonium, would
face a barrage of international opposition if they make their
global journey, the environmental organisation predicted.
Demonstrations are planned in Ireland today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material is being returned to the UK solely because after
being shipped as fuel to Japan in 1999 it was revealed that the
manufacturer, BNFL, had falsified critical quality control data
during its production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry is creating a floating terrorist target and a
dangerous hazard simply in order for BNFL to be able to get new
contracts with its Japanese customers. This would result in yet
more shipments of plutonium fuel, perhaps as many as 80 over the
next decade," Burnie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also serious concerns about the safety of the
shipment, which should&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also have prevented the PNTL vessel leaving. The cask in which
the plutonium is to be transported has not yet been licensed by the
Japanese authorities. An earlier licence was revoked when it was
discovered that levels of the single largest source of
radioactivity in the cask, the radioisotope Plutonium-241, will be
up to twice as high as originally estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment must be abandoned before it is too late. When
this BNFL MOX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fuel arrived in Japan in 1999, Japan was experiencing its worst
ever nuclear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;accident at Tokai-mura. The nuclear industry in the UK and Japan
clearly has not learned from its mistakes, and are showing total
disregard for public safety, the environment and international
security," Burnie concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

            Plutonium transport ship.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship sailed to the Sea of Japan coast under guard from
Japanese coastguard vessels and entered the port area of Takahama
at 9:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessel is due to be loaded within the next few weeks with
rejected plutonium MOX fuel, shipped to Japan by British Nuclear
Fuels (BNFL) in 1999. Then the ship is expected to return to the UK
along one of three secret routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace announced yesterday that the Arctic Sunrise, one of
the Greenpeace ships, would shortly arrive in Japan to join the
protests agsinst this MOX shipment. Greenpeace is also preparing a
legal challenge against the UK Government, in an effort to prevent
the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;En-route nations react with alarm&lt;/p&gt;

Governments in the Caribbean condemned the planned shipment because
of the lack of any notification by the shipping states, Japan and
Britain. En-route nations also fear a terrorist attack or
catastrophic accident. During the past week former security
experts, including a former senior UK Government Minister from the
Defense Department, have labeled the shipment as vulnerable to
armed attack.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, 34 Governments of the Organization of American
States (OAS) adopted a resolution calling for an assessment of the
security threats posed by nuclear transports through the Caribbean
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile called in the British and Japanese ambassadors on Thursday
6th June to convey its concerns about the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Antigua and Barbuda at the OAS meeting made an
impassioned plea in reference to the planned plutonium MOX shipment
from Japan to the UK and called for an end to nuclear shipments.
They states, "Our small states are fearful that a deliberate act of
terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence.
This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday 14 June 2002, the Vice President of the Fiji Senate
made a statement on behalf of the Fiji Government. "The Fiji
Government is firmly opposed to all shipments of MOX fuel through
its EEZ and has always made this clear to the shipping states".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace said, "This plutonium MOX should
never have been shipped to Japan in the first place. In fact, these
shipments present a global threat to the environment through risk
of accident or deliberate attack. This shipment must be
abandoned."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The armed British nuclear transport ship, Pacific Pintail sailing into Takahama, Japan on 14 June 2002.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite an investigation launched last week by the English
regulator, the Environment Agency, into the legality of BNFL's
planned shipment, the company has refused to give any assurances
that it won´t carry out the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two armed British ships - the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal -
arrived in Japan on Friday 14th June to collect the rejected
plutonium MOX which BNFL sold to the Japanese in 1999. After that
sale, it was later revealed that BNFL had deliberately falsified
vital safety control data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL hope that by making the return shipment they will secure
large contracts from the Japanese utilities for MOX production at
the new Sellafield MOX Plant. Since the 1999 scandal, Japan's plans
to move ahead with loading hundreds of tons of MOX fuel reactors
have stalled, prompted by public fears over safety and reliability
of the MOX producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Pintail arrived at the port of Takahama, Japan on
Friday 14th where it delivered the transport cask that it wants to
load with the rejected MOX. Kansai Electric, the original customer
for BNFL, have stated that loading of the MOX into the cask will
begin on Friday June 21st. BNFL has not made any decision about
what to do with the radioactive material, apart from storing
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says that this means the rejected fuel is
"radioactive waste" in European and UK law. Radioactive waste may
only be transported to the UK with the permission of the
Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Environment Agency has not come to a decision on whether it
agrees that this material is radioactive waste. In the meantime
BNFL has refused to halt preparations for the proposed shipment, so
we are seeking an injunction to prevent them carrying out any
irrevocable steps," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 50 countries in the Caribbean, Latin America and the South
Pacific opposed the original shipment of the MOX fuel to Japan in
1999. The return is almost certain to generate even greater
opposition. Already in the past month, Foreign Ministers in the
Caribbean have issued a unanimous condemnation of the planned
shipment, in particular citing security concerns and lack of
consultation by the UK and Japan. They have demanded that it not
use the Caribbean Sea route on its return from Japan. The 34

	Today Mexico decreed the Mexican Whale Sanctuary in all of its EEZ (exclusive economic zone) in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The area of the sanctuary is approximately three million square kilometers.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hold demonstration to demand Mexican whale sancturary.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mexican whale sanctuary is the biggest protected area in
Mexico and the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;largest national whale sanctuary in the world. It occupies an
area equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;half of Europe. All of these European countries would fit
inside: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark,
France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, Norway Luxembourg," said
Juan Carlos Cantú, biodiversity campaigner of Greenpeace
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary would protect 21 species of cetaceans: the right
whale, blue whale, fin whale, grey whale, sei whale, Bryde's whale,
minke whale, humpback whale, sperm whale, pygmy sperm whale, dwarf
sperm whale, Baird's beaked whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, Gervais'
beaked whale, ginko-toothed beaked whale, pygmy beaked whale,
melon-headed whale, killer whale, pygmy killer whale, false killer
whale and pilot whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Mexico started the campaign to create the sanctuary
in 1999. More than 120 thousand signatures were collected in that
year and 125 Mexican and international NGOs signed a letter to the
Mexican President requesting the creation of the sanctuary. Over
the years, thousands of Mexicans sent letters, faxes and e-mails to
the Mexican president requesting the sanctuary. In 2000, a poll in
Mexico City showed that 84 percent of those polled were in favor of
the creation of the sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the offshoots of the campaign was the modification of the
Wildlife Law in 2000 to forbid all whaling in Mexico for commercial
or subsistence purposes, and the listing of all cetaceans as under
special protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decree states that the sanctuary will support the
maintenance of the environmental conditions that are necessary for
the biological functions of whales, such as reproduction, calving,
growth, migration, learning and feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The creation of this sanctuary is a victory for the
conservation of whales and for the Mexican people. The fact that it
was created during the week that the IWC meeting took place in
Shimonoseki, Japan is a message to the entire world that Mexico is
against whaling. This sanctuary should serve as an example for
other countries to follow so that eventually all the oceans of the
world become sanctuaries to protect all species of whales," said
Cantú.&lt;/p&gt;

            Star Wars 17 walking into court in downtown Los Angeles.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen international activists and the two journalists
originally faced double felony charges and up to six years in jail,
but the felony charges were dropped in January when all 17 pled
guilty to a misdemeanour offence of conspiracy to trespass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Townsley, Greenpeace disarmament campaigner said, "We are
pleased this case is now over. But the threats posed by Star Wars
are not."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The process of nuclear escalation has already begun, the US
Administration is now threatening limited nuclear strikes and
planning to arm Star Wars interceptor missiles with nuclear
warheads, blowing apart the myth of a defensive shield - this is an
offensive weapon. If the US continues with this programme it can
only lead to a re-ignition of the arms race and a return to the
'cold war'."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henk Haazen (New Zealand) received 3 years probation, Brent
Maness (USA) received 2 years probation, Dan Rudie (USA) received 1
years probation, Guy Levacher (Canada) received 18 months
probation, Steve Morgan (UK freelance journalist) received 1 year
probation &amp;amp; Jorge Torres (Spain freelance journalist) received
time served for three days already spent in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine of the Star Wars activists were sentenced in January, and
two more last Friday, April 12th - all received one years'
probation. The 17 defendants came from the USA, UK, Germany, India,
Sweden, New Zealand/(the Netherlands), Canada, Spain &amp;amp;
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Statements from the defendants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Henk Haazen - New Zealand:&lt;/p&gt;

Your Honour, Thanks for the opportunity to say a few words, I have
enjoyed this court as much as it is possible under the
circumstances…. and have a lot of respect for the style in which it
is run, at the same time I will be very happy when this is over, as
it has messed up my life a bit for the last 9 months.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reasons why we did our protest action at Vandenberg
are still there, and I feel as strongly about the need to campaign
against the Star Wars missile defence system now as I did on 14
July. September 11th showed that you can never guarantee a 100%
secure defence system that totally isolates or defends a big
democratic country like the US from outside attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Star Wars missile shield system proposes to build a
protective umbrella over the US, by doing so it is forcing other
nations into a new nuclear weapons race that nobody can afford both
in terms of money and resources, and because of the destabilising
effect it has on the current nuclear weapons status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money spend on this program would be better spend on
improving life and the living environment for this planet and
building bridges of friendship to neighbouring countries.I think
that you can compare the situation, to a being a wealthy person
living in a poorer neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living as a wealthy person in a poor area you can choose not to
have much to do with the neighbourhood, build a big wall around the
property, put guards, dogs and locked gates on it, and try to
defend and protect your property like that. This is expensive,
builds up resentment and a negative reaction from your
neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can talk to your neighbours get a bit involved
with them in a nice way and help out here and there. In short
become good neighbours with them, even if they come from a
different culture or race and have a different outlook on life,
religion etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making friends with you neighbours is a much more effective way
to ensure a quiet night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me our protest on the 14th of July was to draw public
attention to the fact that the US is in the process of isolating
itself and building a wall around itself, ignoring protest from
most major world governments at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm from NZ and felt that it was necessary to come to the US and
together with my American friends play an active role in the
peaceful anti-nuclear protest at Vandenberg, so that our voice
could be heard by the people of this country, as this is the place
were most of the changes need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your honour thanks you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Guy Levacher - Canada:&lt;/p&gt;

Your Honour, This has been my experience since July 14th 2001. I
was arrested by the FBI, chained and shackled. I spent 6 days in
maximum security in a state penitentiary with hardcore criminals,
drug traffickers and murderers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel restrictions were imposed upon me for 4 months, limiting
me to the Los Angeles area, prohibiting me from returning to my
country, to be with my family and to provide financial and
emotional support. I was unable to be at my wife's' side while her
mother was dying of cancer. I was unable to pursue my law studies,
for which I had worked so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a nine month sentence for having exercised my basic human
right to protest peacefully. As I stand before you today, I ask
that you allow me to return home to continue my legal studies as I
await the arrival of my first child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Brent Maness - USA:&lt;/p&gt;

As a citizen of the United States it is my duty to oppose the
policies of our government that are contrary to my political and
ideological beliefs, this civic responsibility is one I refuse to
take lightly. I believe that civil disobedience is an effective and
appropriate method of voicing one's opposition to the injustice and
violence perpetuated against living beings and the Earth. I respect
the rule of law, but feel that in extreme instances even legitimate
law should be broken to prevent a greater evil. The rulings at
Nuremberg found that it is intolerable for an individual to
acquiesce when he is aware that his government is in violation of
international law. I believed, and still believe, that it was my
responsibility as a citizen of the United States to do everything
possible to prevent a violation of the Anti Ballistic Missile
Treaty. With that said, I am prepared to accept any punishment that
the court deems fitting for the crime that I have committed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took part in the aforementioned action because I believe that
by testing the Missile Defence System the U.S. is in violation of
an international law that takes precedence over U.S. national law.
The development of the Star Wars program, the consequent U.S.
withdrawal from the ABM treaty and other misguided and unfortunate
actions taken by the Bush Administration have already begun to
exacerbate international instability and create a new nuclear arms
race. This is apparent as the Bush administration embraces the
cold-war era policy of "mutually assured destruction" as the best
means of preventing nuclear war and speaks of using tactical
nuclear weapons in a first strike against the so called "axis of
evil".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been forsaken
for the ignorance that often accompanies fear and hatred. Now it is
more important than ever that our nation exercise caution and
prudence when making policy decisions. I believe that it will prove
beneficial for U.S. economic and security interests to stop Star
Wars and re-examine the policy decisions, both here and abroad,
that have led us to our current state of war and reciprocal
violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Dan Rudie - USA:&lt;/p&gt;

I do not take breaking the law lightly and while I do admit my
guilt in this case, my convictions are important enough to me to
accept the risks involved in taking direct action and the
consequences of those actions. I respect the law and will respect
any probation this court decides, as I have done for the last nine
months.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Steve Morgan - UK (Journalist):&lt;/p&gt;

Your Honour, if it may please the court, I would like to make a
brief statement. I am a professional freelance photographer and
have been for over 20 years of my working life. During this time I
have taken pictures of wars, famines, civil strife and
environmental destruction. During my documentation of such powerful
events I have also recorded the struggles of peoples and
individuals for their own personal dignity and the triumph of hope
and the human spirit over great odds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world view increasingly shaped by corporate advertising and
government spin the actions of individuals striving to be heard
above the clamour of big business and political self interest, I
believe, deserves to be given a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe there is such a thing as objective
photojournalism. We all have our own unique view of the world and
as such will attempt to describe and make sense of it in such
terms. As a photojournalist my interpretation of events is shaped
by my personal views and not by the persons or organisations who
commission the assignments. I would shoot the same pictures whether
I was assigned by the Washington Post , the London Times or indeed
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Magnum photographer Robert Capa once famously remarked
"if your pictures aren't good enough - you're not close enough" -
which, your Honour, had I chosen to ignore this particular piece of
advice, I probably wouldn't have found myself standing here today
in your courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;

Greenpeace has been campaigning against the Project since 1998

health impacts on local people.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plants, built by foreign multinationals against the wishes
of local people, would pollute the air, sully the water and choke
the children of Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thai government's plans for these two large-scale,
polluting,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;community-displacing, coal-fired power plants has met with
unprecedented opposition, both locally and nationally. It has
become one of Thailand's most controversial political issues. The
Prime Minister has said he will decide the issue at the end of
April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Bo Nok and Ban Krut in the Gulf of Thailand have
defied harsh repression for the last eight years to fight plans for
the power plants to be located in their communities. When the Prime
Minister of Thailand visited the Bo Nok site in January, 2002 he
was met by two thousand protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edison International is at the centre of a consortium pushing
this model of power generation on the Thai people. Villagers say
these plant developers are practising gross double standards at the
expense of the Thai people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology at these plants would never meet the
environmental and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social protection standards in California, USA, homestate of the
Edison Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of the two plants is now hanging in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Turkish authorities have refused the toxic ship "Sea Beirut" entry to the Aliaga scrapyard having been warned of its approach by Greenpeace activists.

        &lt;p&gt;
            WTI waste incinerator, East Liverpool.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkish Minister of Environment, Fevzi Aytekin, has today
notified all relevant authorities that Turkey must not allow the
French toxic ship for scrap "Sea Beirut" to enter the country. He
has also said the vessel should return to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessel was illegally exported from France to Turkey to be
scrapped at Aliaga, one of Turkey's notorious ship breaking yards,
with dangerous toxic waste on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace had been tracking the vessel because it was concerned
France may be attempting to illegally dump toxic waste in Turkey,
exposing its people and environment to some of the most dangerous
substances known to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists intercepted the vessel as it neared Turkish
shores last Saturday, and warned the Turkish authorities that it
contained toxic waste. Greenpeace was critical of the Turkish
Ministry of Environment for failing to control the vessels
regularly entering Turkey for scrap with toxic waste on board,
despite a national ban. Following the Greenpeace action, the
Turkish Ministry of Environment responded by taking samples of some
of the hazardous materials found on the ship. This morning it
confirmed that the vessel is carrying asbestos, as Greenpeace had
suspected, and should return to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The French authorities should have stopped this illegal trade
before the vessel left French shores. Now they must ensure the
vessel and all its hazardous cargo is safely returned to France and
hold those responsible for this illegal attempt to dump toxic waste
in Turkey criminally accountable," said Greenpeace campaigner Erdem
Vardar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace discovered that the owner of the 'Sea Beirut'
abandoned the vessel in France after refusing to pay the necessary
40,000 Euros required to clean it of asbestos. The vessel was then
sold to a Turkish shipbreaker, Cemsan, by the Dunkirk port
authorities in France without notifying the Turkish authorities of
the toxic materials on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to a hundred ships are scrapped in Turkey every year. At
least 50 percent of them come from Western European shipping
companies. The costs for dismantling toxic ships in Turkey are
lower than in Europe because not even basic requirements for the
protection of people and the environment are met at ship breaking
yards such as Aliaga where ship breaking practices are comparable
to those in China, India and Bangladesh. Greenpeace is not against
scrapping of vessels but wants to ensure that their export is not
used as an excuse to dump toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This case shows that the Turkish Ministry of Environment has
been ignoring all the toxic waste that's illegally entering Turkey
through the shipbreaking yards in Aliaga. It also clearly
demonstrates the need for the shipping industry to be held
responsible for cleaning vessels of hazardous substances before
they are exported," added Vardar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that toxic ships for scrap are
recognised as a form of hazardous waste trade by all world
governments and that international regulations with a strong

	Two more Greenpeace activists today walked free from court in Los Angeles, after pleading guilty to conspiring to trespass at a military installation, during a peaceful protest against the Star Wars missile defence programme last July.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Two Greenpeace activists walked free from Los Angeles court today.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Knappe and Matthias Pendzailek, from Germany, were given one
year probation. No fines were imposed, and they are free to return
home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine other activists received the same sentence in January. Both
read powerful statements to the court prior to sentence, outlining
their moral and legal objections to the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four other activists and two freelance journalists will be
sentenced on Monday April 15th, after the US Attorney's office
announced in January it may demand jail time for some or all of
those remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Townsley, Greenpeace disarmament campaigner said, "We are
pleased that both Tom and Matt are finally able to put this
needless prosecution behind them. But while they are now free to
get on with their lives, the US Star Wars programme continues to
cast a dangerous shadow across all of our futures by destabilising
the international arms control regime and threatening to ignite a
new nuclear arms race,"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Statement of Tom Knappe, Germany&lt;/p&gt;

Your Honour, Ladies and Gentlemen, Adversaries and Friends of
Greenpeace. Please allow me a few words about the reasons for my
involvement in the peaceful demonstration at Vandenberg Air Force
Base on July 14 2001.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, allow me to make a few remarks about my origin and
upbringing which will explain some of the reasons for my
participation in the peaceful demonstration against the National
Missile Defence Program, or Star Wars test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know I was born in East Germany, the former German
Democratic Republic and lived there until I was 22 years old. It
was a country without democracy and liberal civil rights. The
effects of the Cold War have influenced and affected my life
presumably more than any other persons here in this room. I shall
never forget the moment when I stood at the Wall in Berlin, shocked
by the idiocy and vanity of the political systems. A brutal and
deadly separation of people, made by the people themselves, in the
midst of a civilized world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I had to join the army of the German Democratic Republic
and objected to military service under arms, I faced two options:
1. go to prison for several years, or, 2. flee from the country. I
chose the latter, which was by no means easy to do, because I had
personally tried to convince many of friends to stay in the country
and to resist oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was an acknowledged actor in the German Democratic
Republic. When he started to become bothersome in the eyes of the
political system on account of his liberal opinions, he was
officially banned from his occupation. Socially isolated, he
resorted to drinking which led to his early death at an age of 51
years. I was 27 at that time. A later friend of my mother, who,
because he had "painted pictures that criticized the system" and
was repeatedly detained in the prisons of State Security in the
days of the former East German Republic, committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State Security agents were also closely observing me. Among
other reasons, because I had protested, publicly but peacefully,
against the deployment of Russian "SS 20" and "SS 23" missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in 1988 I intended to visit Romania and Bulgaria, which
were still socialist countries at that time, I was refused
permission to travel, no reasons were stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not telling you this for you to pity me. These occurrences
were only a few of the direct and indirect effects of the Cold War
which many of my fellow men and myself experienced in our youth,
and I believe that such projects as Star Wars could blow the world
back into a state of Cold War. It was oftentimes the irony of
history, and also the "Policy of Power" demonstrated by the Western
World, that provided the totalitarian regimes of the Eastern bloc
with the arguments which induced them to build an
"anti-capitalistic protective wall" (The Wall) and lock up their
own population out of fear of the democratic and liberal world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Honour, the reason why I came to the United States was not
to violate the law of this country, but to participate in a civil
protest, following the tradition of Greenpeace, which is strictly
non-violent. It was a protest against one of the greatest and
politically and technologically most hazardous military projects in
the history of mankind. The Star Wars test that day violated the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which was still valid at the
time of our protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not without reason has the Treaty been cancelled by President
Bush in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Missile Defence Program gives the wrong signal to
the world community, ideologically and politically. It might urge
countries such as India, Pakistan, Russia and China to enter into a
new arms race, the dimensions and political long-term effects of
which no one can really know today. It is also wrong especially
because the chances of real détente and a true end to the Cold War
between the East and the West never have been so close as now. The
most recent history of the conflicts between India and Pakistan in
the region of Kashmir have shown how fast the use of nuclear
weapons can become an issue on the agenda of the military
forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, on the rocky road to a peaceful world, there can
only be but one solution, total nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Missile Defence Program is also controversial as
far as its feasibility is concerned. Even American experts do not
try to conceal the fact that the rate of success lies at a maximum
of 95 percent when it comes to eliminating hostile missiles. You do
not have to be a mathematical genius to be able to calculate that a
potential enemy will rearm correspondingly, which means increasing
its defences twenty-fold, just enough so that the remaining 5
percent of the missiles will fulfil their intended military purpose
of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Honour, ladies and gentlemen, recent occurrences have
demonstrated in the most painful way imaginable that belief in
absolute security as well as an exaggerated and uncritical reliance
on technology, leads people astray. But it is this alleged absolute
safety that the advocates of the National Missile Defence Program
try to communicate to us. The political and technological hazards
which also exist for the territory of the United States are mostly
not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four months in which we were not allowed to return to our
home countries have clearly left their traces in the lives of the
defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother had to seek psychological assistance and undergo
therapy, my company nearly faced bankruptcy. Contrary to permanent
suspicions of the district attorney, we have behaved cooperatively
throughout the entire proceedings and have appeared at all hearing
dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to repeat that none of the defendants has come
to the United States to violate law and order. I believe that just
attempting to demonstrate against rearmament in a peaceful protest
will be judged and valued differently in the history books 50 or
100 years from now. Certainly there will always be people who will
try to disparage us as idiots or as dreamers who think they can set
the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;world to rights. The pioneers of international environmental
protection as well as the pioneers of the peace and human rights
movements were confronted with the same problem several decades
ago. To compare peaceful Greenpeace activists with terrorists, or
to consider the action at Vandenberg Air Force Base as a
conspiracy, is grotesque, hysterical and does not give evidence of
highly social competence. Perhaps it is an expression of the
permanent fear which the mighty have of the weak. If men like
Martin Luther King would have placed their fears of violating the
law above their ethical visions, the world today would not have
become a better place for all of us to live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you for your attention and ask you to consider the
motivation of our behaviour in your judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodybold"&gt;Statement of Matthias Pendzailek, Germany&lt;/p&gt;

Your Honour:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for you to understand my actions, I would like to say
some words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My actions were based on civil disobedience. As a German I have
to carry the heritage of my predecessors, and therefore the
responsibility to stand up and, through peaceful protest, to say
No! when it is apparent that international law is being broken and
global provocation's take us closer to war and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I am convinced that we all have the responsibility
to carry through the painful but ultimately instructive and
valuable experiences from the past to our descendants. We must not
forget, in order to prevent the past from catching up with us in
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we all have the obligation to respect nature and our
fellow men. People need nature, but nature does not need people.
This must also be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom of speech is one of the most important democratic
rights. If the masses don't realise deficiencies, individuals have
the responsibility to clearly point out what is wrong and speak out
even more loudly and more distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem there are only a few people willing to awaken
their fellow men, who have been lulled into a stupor, and make them
aware of their global responsibility. We have only one Mother Earth
and we must share it with each other. Therefore, we also must take
care of her together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accept responsibility for my actions, but I hope my motivation
for civil disobedience, expressed through peaceful protest, might
now be understood more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you very much for your attention. Please consider my
statement in your judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today 400 of Esso's UK petrol stations were the scene of StopEsso protests. Protesters from all walks of life were out in force to ensure Esso and its customers get the message that Esso's policies make it the world's No1 global warmer.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cindy Baxter of StopEsso UK takes up the story: "Today the sound
of cars beeping for the boycott have echoed through deserted Esso
forecourts across the UK. This protest is now going global, and
will continue until Esso changes its irresponsible undermining of
action on climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the counrty people reported a fantastic response from the
public, with many drivers "beeping for the boycott", and friendly
police. A lot of drivers, seeing the StopEsso signs, turned round
and drove off. Empty petrol forecourts all round!&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activist at French Esso refinery.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using inflatable boats, Greenpeace activists prevented tankers
from leaving the refinery, and had hoses turned on them by the
tanker crews. On shore more activists, some dressed as tigers -
Esso's corporate symbol - blocked road tanker access gates into the
facility and handed out information to workers and passers-by. More
tigers scaled the perimeter "watchtowers" and amplified the Stop
Esso message with loudhailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Regardless of where in the world it operates, whether under the
name of Exxon, Esso or Mobil, this oil company has done more than
any other to sabotage international action on climate change," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner Benedict Southworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso backed the Bush Administration with massive political
contributions and spent more than even Enron on lobbying the White
House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the US walked away from the only international
agreement to address climate change - the Kyoto Protocol. President
Bush instead came up a domestic, voluntary scheme that would
increase greenhouse emissions by 36 percent. That policy was
effectively written by Esso."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is recognised as a serious problem by thousands
of the world's leading scientists and most governments. Over the
next century, a warming of just a few degrees will lead to sea
level rise, chaotic weather patterns, agricultural loss and spread
of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso pursues its profits at the expense of human lives and
livelihoods, ignoring warnings from the world's leading scientists
that climate change is already happening and will get worse," said
Southworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People are worried about climate change and angry with the Esso
Bush alliance that is blocking action. Esso must be stopped and
that's why we are here today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, acting on the direction of US oil giant
Exxon/Mobil, and using Saudi Arabia, other OPEC states, and Japan,
has waged a campaign against Dr. Robert Watson, current chair of
the IPCC. Dr Watson, an outspoken advocate for action to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, has been the head of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for six years.&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace action at Esso headquarters in Hamburg, Germany.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists climbed the roof of Esso's ten-story building and
installed dollar signs in place of the letter 'S' in the
corporation's logo. Banners reading "Esso: Maximum profit, zero
responsibilty" were hung on the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether you call it Exxon, Esso or Mobil, this oil company has
done more than any other to sabotage international action on
climate change," said Greenpeace energy expert Karsten Smid.
"ExxonMobil systematically undermines all efforts to address global
warming. The corporation's lobbying is a significant factor in the
Bush government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Exxon's
influence even caused Dr. Robert Watson, the renowned climate
scientist, to lose his chair at the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil makes billions of dollars profits from oil at the
expense of the environment. In 2001 ExxonMobil made a profit of
US$15 billion, but refuses to invest a single dollar in renewable
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists inside the meeting unfurled banners calling
for a fundamental transformation of trade rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting has concluded with a declaration that falls short of
ambitions declared at the start of negotiations and also
disappoints hopes for protection of communities and the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This meeting has failed to produce a vision for sustainable
development and the protection of the environment" said Greenpeace
International Political Director Remi Parmentier, speaking from the
meeting site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The WTO has two crises of confidence: Opposition from the
outside world to this trade liberalisation agenda, and an internal
crisis of dissent among WTO member countries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parmentier called for an international conference to revise the
relationship between the WTO, International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting ran into overtime and concluded only in the last
possible hours of discussion. The agreement on environment offers
very little progress in defending environmental protections against
trade concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every step of progress on the environment is countered by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;contradictory language or harmful measures" said Greenpeace
Canada campaigns director Jo Dufay, on board the Rainbow
Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They have agreed to study the relationship between trade rules
and the environment, but also said that WTO rules won't change."
Dufay was in Doha for the trade meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement on areas for further trade liberalisation was
finalised today after a grueling round-the-clock negotiating
session. Apart from the environment, major differences on
investment, 'dumping', agriculture and market access for textiles
stalled the talks for days. Developing nations claimed their needs
had not been addressed by the rich countries, and that unfair
pressure was being exerted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, liberalisation of investment measures was not
resolved, with agreement only that this may undergo further
negotiations at the next Ministerial meeting, two years from
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier agreement on drug patent issues offers some relief to
earlier WTO agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whole issue of medicines and the patenting of life should
never have been subject to horse-trading in the first place,"
Parmentier commented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are have come up with a balance of misery, where everyone
is unhappy, especially developing nations. This is no way to run
the world," Dufay concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	ExxonMobil shareholders delivered a massive blow to the company today in a vote on the company's renewable energy policies.

            Climbers paint 'Stop Esso' on a fuel tank at Esso refinery.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resolution demanding Exxon (also known as Esso) outline its
future plans for the promotion of renewable energy gained an
unprecedented 20.3 percent of shareholders' votes - $55 billion in
shares - at the company's annual meeting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year's vote marks a substantial increase over last year,
when a similar resolution garnered just 8.9 percent of the vote.
The vote follows advice that the company's failure to respond to
climate change by investing in renewables could damage its
profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The magnitude of this vote shows that shareholders as well as
customers are concerned about Exxon's attitude toward climate
change," said Greenpeace International climate campaigner Stephanie
Tunmore. "The increased level of support for the resolution among
mainstream investors shows a growing awareness of the dangers of
climate change, but it also reflects concern that Exxon is missing
out on lucrative new energy technology markets and risking major
brand damage from a consumer backlash," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two weeks protests against Exxon's sabotage of
international climate negotiations were held in Australia, Austria,
France, UK, U.S., Luxembourg, Germany and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is taking the heat around the globe for being the prime
force behind President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto treaty to
fight global warming," said Kert Davies, Greenpeace U.S. climate
campaign coordinator. "Exxon should immediately cease its
manipulation of climate science and politics and start implementing
clean energy solutions to climate change, as a significant group of
its investors wants."&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace action at sawmill belonging to Maginco,  Brazil's biggest mahogany trading company.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists were calling on President Bush to return all
mahogany shipments from Brazil and to investigate companies that
continue to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists escorted the shipment carrying illegal
Brazilian mahogany in two inflatable boats, with banners reading
"Stop Illegal Logging". Another boat carried a freelance
photographer who was there to document the peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI arrested the 14 Greenpeace protestors and a freelance
photographer and they are now facing multiple felonies and will be
formally arraigned on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week the Brazilian President called for continued
support of Greenpeace and world governments to continue to help
Brazil tackle the illegal timber trade in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Cardoso said: "I shall continue to count on the
backing of governments, prefects and civil society so that Brazil
can learn to respect itself and so that the country gains the
respect and support of other countries by preserving the noble
species that are found in our forests, such as mahogany."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Roselle, Greenpeace forest campaigner, said Greenpeace was
shining a spotlight on an environmental crime in the peaceful
manner the organization has used for 30 years. "For a peaceful
protest to be called a felony compromises the spirit of civil
disobedience on which this country was founded," said Roselle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government has been holding Brazilian mahogany in a
number of US ports for more than a month and has not indicated what
they will do with the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still time to halt ancient forest destruction and save
the plants, animals and livelihoods of people who depend on the
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments are meeting in the Hague this week and next for the
Ancient Forest Summit. They will decide the fate of the world's
remaining ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace's newest ship, Esperanza, and flagship, Rainbow Warrior, joined forces today off the coast of the Netherlands to block the harbour and stop ancient forest timber from entering the port of Flushing.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/greenpeace-activists-boarding.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists boarding the MV Balaban 1, a ship delivering illegally logged Amazon wood.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior and the Esperanza entered the harbour with
the Balaban I close behind. Ten Greenpeace inflatables were in the
water. As the Balaban I approached, several Greenpeace climbers
were able to board her. Meanwhile a tug boat was attempting to
attach a bow line but was delayed by Greenpeace inflatables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turkish flaged ship 'Balaban 1´ is carrying 4,000 cubic
metres of wood from the Amazon rainforest. As the ship neared the
harbour, its crew used fire hoses to spray water on the six
Greenpeace activists who were attempting to board the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Greenpeace ships then blocked the timber ship´s intended
berth while the six activists boarded it and unfurled two banners,
one displaying the Dutch and Brazilian flags, urging those and
other governments meeting in the Hague, to "Act Now" to save the
ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World governments meeting at the Ancient Forests Summit this
week have made no progress towards agreeing to protect the world's
ancient forests. Today's Greenpeace action exposes the need for
international cooperation to save ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two days ago Greenpeace activists were arrested in Miama
attempting to stop yet another ship carrying illegal timber from
the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world's ancient forests continue to be destroyed, Brazil
and the Netherlands, in particular, seem to be uninterested in
taking leadership at the Ancient Forest Summit. The Netherlands,
hosting the Summit in the Hague, is not controlling the importation
of illegal timber and is not showing the leadership that is
required to make the negotiations on ancient forests a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government recently announced that it will
continue to eradicate illegal logging of mahogany. However, it is
not clear who defines the Brazilian position, the President or the
Brazilian delegation in the Hague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the negotiations this past week, Brazilian delegates have
been strongly opposing the prioritisation of ancient forests
protection, and refusing to take immediate action on combating
illegal logging and related trade. Without international
cooperation, markets around the world will continue to accept
timber from illegal and destructive logging, fuelling the crisis in
the world's last remaining ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

	LATEST UPDATES: www.stop-plutonium.orgThanks to the Bush Administration's disregard for global concerns about nuclear proliferation, two ships carrying some 140kg of weapons-grade plutonium are en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Cherbourg in France.  The two lightly armed UK-flagged commercial nuclear ships are now somewhere off the coast of France, waiting until a possible injunction is served against Greenpeace, to dock.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists spend the night waiting for the imminent arrival of two BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) ships, which are carrying 140kg of radioactive weapons-grade plutonium. The Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal left the U.S. port of Charleston, SC on September 20th.  Greenpeace believes the shipment conducted by the US and France is unnecessarily threatening international security and putting the environment at risk.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US lacks a suitable nuclear facility for converting this
potential weapons material into experimental plutonium fuel (MOX) -
so the Bush Administration is allowing it to be shipped around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment began its journey at the US Department of Energy's
Los Alamos nuclear weapons facility in New Mexico, and covered
almost 2,500km before arriving in Charleston. The ships left North
Carolina and passed close to the Irish coast on their way to
Cherbourg. Once unloaded the shipment will cover up to 1200km of
roads before arriving at a closed plutonium fuel fabrication
facility in Cadarache, in the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, two workers were contaminated during a
nuclear accident involving plutonium at the Cadarache facility,
which is operated by the state-owned nuclear company Areva/Cogema.
As for the Los Alamos National Laboratory - operations there were
recently suspended after classified data 'went missing'.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="66833"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total journey for the plutonium shipment? A ridiculous
6589km!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the US and France, local groups have mounted strong
opposition to shipments, including the Nuclear-Free Atlantic
Flotilla and Citizens Against Plutonium. Greenpeace also has been
waiting patiently for the shipment to arrive and holding peaceful
protests however the local authorities have responded with a heavy
hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene Riguidel, one of France's most famous sailors, John
Castle of Guernsey and Pernilla Svenberg from Greenpeace
International were arrested for mounting a peaceful protest inside
the military port against the plutonium shipment. Although they
were released within 24 hours from the military arsenal in
Cherbourg, Greenpeace has been summoned to appear in the Cherbourg
Court to face a request by Areva, through its subsidiary Cogema,
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), for an injunction preventing
it from approaching within 300m of the two ships carrying plutonium
or within 100m of the Cherbourg harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment sends the strongest signal that the US holds
little regard for global efforts to keep nuclear weapons materials
out of commerce," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace International.
"It is the height of arrogance to conduct a shipment like this
while demanding other nations refrain from proliferating nuclear
weapons materials and technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Charleston, Citizens Against Plutonium (CAP) was formed in
response to the nuclear shipment, and to the refusal of the US
Department of Energy to prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment
on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How sensible is it to sail a ship carrying plutonium round the
world at a time when world security is volatile? Whenever such a
deadly substance is moved, there will be a risk of accidents or
terrorist attacks. In the event of an incident, plutonium could be
dispersed into the ocean, poisoning people and the marine
environment on which we depend," said local Charleston resident
Merrill Chapman of Citizens Against Plutonium.
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="x" border="0" vspace="4" align="right" item_id="67469"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Homeland Security wrote to Representative
Ed Markey on September 8, telling him that "Coast Guard cutters,
boats, aircraft and other local law enforcement and Navy assets"
would be involved securing the passage of the ship. While the same
letter admitted that no "formal threat assessment" had been
prepared on the shipment, it seems that the Coast Guard had
prepared "a field intelligence report" on environmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This transport is part of a misguided plan to put weapons
plutonium into commercial use by converting it into MOX fuel for
use in nuclear reactors. This is an expensive and dangerous way to
dispose of plutonium. All existing plutonium should be secured and
mixed with nuclear waste and vitrified in robust containers, "
concluded Clements.&lt;/p&gt;

	A four-year-old scandal involving the MV Ulla, a vessel carrying hazardous waste from Spain, finally came to a head on Monday outside the Turkish port of Iskenderun, where the vessel sank taking 2000 tons of hazardous waste with it.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/a-four-year-old-scandal-involv.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/a-four-year-old-scandal-involv.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The MV Ulla sank, burying 2000 tons of toxic waste into the sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Turkish authorities, the fly ash, which came from
the burning of coal in three power plants in the North of Spain,
seeped into the sea when the MV Ulla started sinking on 6
September. The vessel had been docked in Turkey for over four years
after the Turkish authorities had refused the hazardous cargo to be
off-loaded on its shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environmental fiasco started back in 1999 when 3,488 tons
of hazardous fly ash was loaded onto the MV Ulla in Spain. The
hazardous waste was to be sent to the Spanish company S.A. P/C De
Dragados in Algeria. But following Algeria's rejection of the
hazardous cargo, the ship mysteriously ended up in Turkey. Dragados
claimed that the cargo was damaged as a result of bad loading in
Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waste contained chromium VI - a highly toxic heavy metal -
environmentally hazardous as well as dangerous for humans. The
responsibility for its return lay with the Spanish government,
since the ship loaded its hazardous waste in Spain. However neither
the Turkish nor the Spanish authorities bothered taking any
precautions to contain the environmental hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="The MV Ulla, a vessel carrying hazardous waste, during its sinking in Iskenderun port, Turkey." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="66545"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Since
the entry of such hazardous waste into Turkey is banned under both
national and international legislation (Basel Convention), the
Turkish government had been urging the Spanish government to take
back the ship. In January 2002 they again urged the Spanish
government and the Basel Secretariat to resolve this problem. It
seems that no one wanted to take responsability for this
environmental time bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the ship has sunk, the Basel Convention does not
provide liability provision for cleaning up the mess. However, the
Spanish government are reportedly offering to help in the clean-up
operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this seems too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's good to know that Spain is willing to help, but both
countries should have acted way too late on this matter. Four years
is too much time to spend on a clear case of waste trade scandal.
This wreck and damage at the bottom of the blue Mediterranean sea
would have been avoided if Spain and Turkey has acted on time",
said Banu Dockmecibasi, Greenpeace Turkey Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

            Philippine artists dramatize the dangers of pollutants from incineration.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and 126 community groups spanning 54 countries
demanded governments end waste incineration, and adopt recycling
instead. This global day of action was spearheaded by Greenpeace
and GAIA, the Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance. Demonstrations
swept across the globe, from Asia to Africa, Europe, North America
and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Incinerators are multi-billion dollar pollutors and waste the
planet's valuable resources," said Greenpeace toxics campaigner,
Veronica Odriozola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, protestors climbed and capped the stack of that
nation's biggest incinerator. In Ankara, Turkey, climbers on ropes
descended the 127-metre Atakule tower and hung a giant banner
reading "Ban the Burn." In Basingstoke, UK and in Bilbao, Spain,
protestors stopped construction at the sites of two new municipal
waste incinerators. In Chile activists blocked the entrance of an
incineration plant, and in the Philippines actors demonstrated the
toxic effects of pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of action took place as leaders met in Geneva for the
first time since agreeing persistent poisons must be eliminated
under the Stockholm Convention. Despite the agreement to ban the
poisons, many governments are still promoting industries that
release them into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To continue promoting incineration while agreeing to eliminate
persistent organic pollutants is sheer hypocrisy," said
Odriozola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treaty identifies all waste incinerators as a primary source
of PCBs, furans and cancer causing dioxins, the most harmful
chemicals known to science. It obligates governments to give
priority to alternative ways to manage wastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemicals released from incinerators cause a variety of health
problems, including immune and reproductive system defects,
spontaneous abortions, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hormone
disruption and cancers. Some fish caught in European Union waters
are so contaminated with dioxins they have been declared unfit for
human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

	At the opening of the Premier Vision textile exhibition in Paris, activists dressed in black t-shirts - each one revealing the faces of Bhopal victims - confronted Dow Chemical as the company presented its new fibre, XLA. Dow Chemical is responsible for the 1984 disaster in the Indian city of Bhopal - a tragedy that still continues, even twenty years later.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-displays-a-banner-w.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-displays-a-banner-w.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace displays a banner with pictures of the victims of the world's worst industrial disaster-Bhopal- at the opening of an international textile exhibition in Paris, where DOW Chemical, the entity responsible for the 1984 disaster presented a new fibre called XLA. We're asking asking Dow Chemical to face its moral and financial responsibilities before investing in new markets.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Dow launch, our activists displayed a massive banner showing pictures of the world's worst industrial disaster and distributed 4,000 flyers regarding the company's corporate irresponsibility. Along with the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal - an International coalition of Bhopal survivors and International NGOs campaigning for justice in Bhopal - we demand that Dow accepts full liability for the ongoing disaster in Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Dow representatives claimed that their textile launch had nothing to do with corporate accountability, and refused to meet any of the Bhopal survivors - suggesting that Dow cares more about its new line of fabrics than the plight of thousands of Bhopalis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, a delegation from Dow France arrived, and quickly agreed to meet our team and the young Bhopal victims. During the meeting, the General Manager of Dow France, Pierre-Jean Brochand, promised to answer survivors' questions on what Dow will do about the clean up of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were really surprised - Dow really didn't expect us to show up at a textile show. But then we were astonished to find them taking such a proactive stance. Most of the time Dow try to avoid us - this time they seemed to have been softened up, and a little threatened by our sudden appearance. The outcome was that we managed to me M. Brochand, who has promised to get us answers in the next few days. We need to know what they're going to do about the clean up of Bhopal - and what they're not going to do," said Greenpeace France campaigner Aurele Clemencin, who was at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bhopal disaster occured on 3 December 1984, when more than 40 tonnes of poisonous gases leaked from a storage tank at a Union Carbide (now owned by Dow) pesticide factory into the heart of Bhopal, immediately killing 8,000 people. In the last twenty years, another 20,000 people have died from illnesses caused by the disaster. Survivors and their children are still dealing with the long-term health effects, including cancer, tuberculosis, birth defects and chronic fevers. In June 2004, the Government of India submitted a statement to the New York District Court on the Bhopal contamination clean up case, asking Union Carbide to carry out the Bhopal plant-site remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The people affected by the disaster now live in the shadow of an ongoing environmental and health catastrophe. The banner that carries the faces of the Bhopali victims reveals the hidden collection of Dow - the real story of Bhopal after twenty years. We, the people of Bhopal have suffered for 20 years now and it is disheartening to discover that instead of taking responsibility for cleaning up the polluted disaster site in Bhopal and offering medical assistance to the ailing survivors, Dow is busy making profits." Said Rani Niloufer, one of the Bhopal survivor who met with Dow. Rani was born the year of the disaster, and still suffers from the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow should pay for the health treatments of the survivors, and clean up both the large stockpiles of dangerous poisons and the contaminated underground water left behind at the accident site. Our activists have worked in Bhopal since 1999. Back then, a when a team of our scientists worked with Bhopal community groups, analysing the severity and extent of the contamination on and around the factory site. We found severe contamination of both land and water supplies by heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dow investors, and all those who will buy this fabric, should be aware that Dow has blood on their hands and no new textile will help them hide their crimes in Bhopal. Only when they pay for all the survivors' health treatments and clean up the poisonous site, will justice be done," added Vinuta Gopal, Greenpeace campaigner from India protesting today in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Dow really answer the questions of the Bhopal victims? Stay tuned to find out...&lt;/p&gt;

	The Ford motor company is scrapping its fleet of zero emission electric vehicles in the US. Not content with being the worst ranked motor company on fuel efficiency it has decided to plumb new depths by sending its most fuel efficient, zero emission Th!nk cars to the crushers.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-plans-to-crush-all-its-el.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-plans-to-crush-all-its-el.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ford plans to crush all its electric Th!nk cars despite being offered US$1million for them. Ford is crushing this environmental solution because it succeeded in trashing the California legislation that encouraged their use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is a global corporation courting even worse publicity and
going back on numerous promises to improve the environmental
credentials of its cars? The vehicle is popular with consumers -
there were waiting lists to buy the cars after a hugely popular
leasing period started in 2001. Zero-emission cars reduce urban
smog. When charged by electricity from renewable sources, they help
fight the biggest threat to our planet - climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With record oil prices forcing gasoline prices up, they are also
a sound economic choice. Popular, clean and efficient, shouldn't
this be part of the future of transport rather than being reduced
to small cubes of scrap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Protest against Ford's scrapping of electric Think Cars." title="Protest against Ford's scrapping of electric Think Cars." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="65855"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, money doesn't seem to be the motivation. Even if
Ford doesn't want the cars, a Norwegian firm has plenty of
customers and has offered US$1 million for them. Ford hasn't even
replied to the offer. So we've launched a campaign to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1493&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;tell
Ford&lt;/a&gt; to send these cars to people who want them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be that Ford intends to prevent the emergence of a
zero-emission electric vehicles industry? Ford originally brought
the Norwegian Th!ink car company in 1999. However while Ford and
other car companies produced electric vehicles they where working
to gut the clean air regulations in California that made them
viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behind-the-scenes lobbying to halt progressive legislation
is not the kind of thing that appears in the glossy, soft-focus
company promo material. But it is a top priority of many US
carmakers. Public statements instead highlighted the supposedly
progressive work Ford was doing. In 2000 CEO William C Ford said:
"Ford Motor Company also has been a leader in the development of
clean-running alternative fuel vehicles. We are the world's leading
producer and seller of electric vehicles. We've just launched an
entire new brand - THINK."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the dirty work of killing the clean air regulation in
California completed in 2002, Ford dumped its commitment to
electric cars faster than you can say "SUV" and sold off Th!nk.
This means business as usual for the automakers, producing bigger,
thirstier cars every year without the burden of regulation in the
US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's current fleet of cars is actually less efficient than the
80-year-old Model-T Ford. You read that right - 80 years of
corporate 'leadership' at Ford has meant no better fuel efficiency
than 1920's technology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric cars are not the complete solution to the environmental
problems of transport. But they are light years better than the
current trend toward big gas-guzzlers that are helping to fuel
global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;In the 21st century we need clean solutions to the problems of transport. Ford is trying to kill one of these solutions. &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1493&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;It's time to tell Ford not to scrap the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our team of Greenpeace Jaguars, who have been protecting the ancient forests of Argentina from the expansion of Genetically Engineered soya, have been arrested while documenting the deforestation in northern Argentina some 1800 km north of Buenos Aires in the city of Tartagal, north of Salta province.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists, dressed as 'jaguars', used chains to immobilise bulldozers that have been destroying Yungas forest in north west Argentina. Argentina's forests are being cut down to grow Monsanto's genetically engineered soya for export as animal feed to Europe and China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the nine is Martin Prieto the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceArgentina. The Jaguars' lawyer was also thrown into jail,
thusdepriving them of legal representation. Our team in Argentina
hasspoken with the Jaguars and for now they remain in good
spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that they were arrested for the misdemeanour
oftrespassing, so far the judge has decided not to release them and
couldkeep them in jail for days. For now they are being held under
custodyin the Intelligence Brigade of the State Police of Salta in
a localpolice station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jaguars have been prowling Argentina's native forests for
over amonth now, tracking down its destruction and trying to halt

<item><language>en</language><title>The Summer X Games: extreme and green</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/x-games-go-green/</url><text>
	The X Games are the punk rock of sports, and if you can land a Twirly-bird varial to a tweaked out kickflip Indy, then you might get to play with the big boys.  This year the X Games are green as well as extreme. In addition to the use of Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®) certified skateboard ramps, there are numerous subversive eco-actions taking place during the event.  Are you going to call any of these guys wimped out tree-huggers? I don't think so.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/a-skateboarder-practises-on-th.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A skateboarder practises on the ramps at the X Games. For the first time FSC® wood was used during the games. FSC® stands for Forest Stewardship Council™: the wood is from a forest which is well managed according to strict environmental social and economic standards.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;What, no badminton?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's August and the sun is shining mercilessly on downtown Los Angeles. The temperature in the parking lot is nearly 100° F; thousands of people are packing the venues; and the music is loud enough to discourage all but the briefest shouted conversations. Extreme heat, extreme crowds,and extreme noise- everything one would expect at X Games, the tenth instalment of this annual alternative Olympics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't look for archery and badminton here. The X Games are for skateboarders, bike stunts, aggressive in-line skaters, and Moto X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not, however, the place for grass roots environmentalists and organic farmers. Or is it? Bob Burnquist is both, and he's also one of the top skateboarders in the world. He sees the X Games as the perfect opportunity to mould young minds. "I think it's super important to get informed and make environmentally sound decisions. An event like this lets us educate kids about environmental issues that affect their sports and their lives."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greening the Games&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burnquist and his wife, Jen O'Brien, also a professional skateboarder, are founding members of the Action Sports Environmental Coalition (ASEC), the group that is responsible for greening the X Games. They've teamed up with Frank Scura, CEO of Eco resolutions, to incorporate an unprecedented degree of sustainability into this year's event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the changes: the use of Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) certified wood for the competition ramps. The FSC®, an international organisation founded in 1993, is dedicated to promoting environmentally and socially responsible management of the world's forests. The FSC® logo helps consumers to distinguish products coming from responsible forest management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Scura is quick to mention: "The ramps turned out great. It's the same wood you buy in the store- the only difference is the forest is properly managed. It's not old growth; they're not spraying pesticides on it; and they're not clear-cutting."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you spit out your gum and say "Big deal," take a look around. The events at the Staples Center depend entirely on the size and quality of the ramps. Inside the arena, skateboarders, BMX bike riders and in-line skaters compete on a smooth wooden surface shaped like a deep kidney bean-shaped swimming pool with one end missing. The curves are flawless and the seams are nearly invisible. Outside, the huge BMX stunt park consists of myriad ramps and landings that flow like the lines of an M.C. Escher woodcut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/em&gt; is surely the immense spectacle duly dubbed the Mega Ramp. One look at the thing will impress even the most hardened adrenaline junkie and will likely cause the first-time spectator to stop dead in his tracks, eyes popped and jaw dropped, pointing skyward and raising a question that undoubtedly features a curse word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the X Games' first ever Big Air competition, skateboarders drop into the 50-foot ramp and take flight over an equally wide gap to land (hopefully) on a quarter pipe that sends them another 20 feet into the air where they try to keep it together long enough to perform a trick and land on the near-vertical ramp that promises to deliver them safely to the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're Danny Way, the man who conceived the Mega Ramp, you launch from nine stories up and manage a Christ Air (like a horizontal spread eagle with a skateboard in one hand) over a 70-foot gap on your way to winning a gold medal. Think: ski jump at Lake Placid without the bindings or soft, fresh snow. Said Way, "I was confident coming in, but I was also concerned with getting hurt before the event started." Really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tree huggers need not apply&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how did FSC® wood end up at the X Games anyway? As Scura recounts, it all started when Burnquist and O'Brien joined Greenpeace in the Amazon two years ago to increase awareness of the threat to ancient forests and to promote sustainable forestry. They rode the first ever FSC® certified half-pipe at the Ecosystem Festival in Burnquist's native Brazil, and they were hooked, on FSC® wood and on Greenpeace: "Greenpeace is one of the best things that has happened in the world society. Especially their campaigns that help safeguard our forests."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The X Games are more than just a spectator sport, they are truly interactive, and if an athlete is concerned about his or her impact on the environment, then an event like this presents a golden opportunity to make a real difference. That is precisely the opportunity being seized by ASEC. Scura and his friends have a strong presence at this year's games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the ASEC booth, they are giving away trading cards printed on 100percent recycled paper and processed without chlorine. The cards feature environmental quotes from top competitors along with an assortment of eco-facts. As Scura says, "You've got strong images of these athletes jumping 70 feet through the air and landing on a handrail at 40 mph and then doing 25 foot airs. Are you going to call any of them a wimped-out tree hugger? I don't think so." Scura's Pied Piper personality draws in everyone within earshot, and question and answer sessions frequently have to be stopped for crowd control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I think Greenpeace is cool"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another cool initiative of these Games is the near-constant flow of celebrity athletes coming through to sign autographs. Throughout the day kids can meet their action sports idols and have their picture taken. Lines extend around the block when people like Matt Hoffman, Bob Burnquist, Jen O'Brien, John Parker, Bucky Lasek, and Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins are in the tent, and each of these athletes expresses a sincere interest in getting the word out about environmental responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 14, gold medallist Hawkins is younger than some of her fans, and she stumbles on the word sustainable, but she knows what it means, and she's stoked that the ramps at X Games are made from FSC® wood. She praises the quality of the ramps and adds, "I think Greenpeace is cool."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The huge speakers at the nearby Tascam DJ stage are designed for efficiency, and the whole sound system is powered by a solar bus with 24 deep cycle batteries supplied by US Battery, a company owned by Scura's brother-in-law. He is quick to point out all of the technical features of both the big white bus and the music platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final bit of greenness at X Games might be found in the waste management logo located on all the cardboard trash bins at the Staples Center. Scura says that the company plans to sort all the garbage into recyclables and non-recyclables in order to cut down on the amount of material destined for landfills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why did ESPN, the owner of the X Games, agree to go green? Home Depot was able to acquire the FSC® wood at a competitive price, and ESPN saw sufficient value in supporting the athletes' efforts to promote social consciousness. But Scura adds "We're definitely looking to do more next year."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspiration and improvement&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a good thing too, because there's room for improvement. Disposable, non-biodegradable plastic is everywhere- plates, utensils, bags, cups, packaging, and freebies. There is nowhere any indication of Waste Management's intent to recycle. Information about FSC® certification is not prominent, and the solar bus is hidden behind a fence. Lastly, ESPN turned down an offer by Off The Grid Consulting to provide recycled vegetable oil to power the remote generators - they ended up using 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even so, ASEC's progress is inspiring, especially Scura's dedication. He displays a comprehensive knowledge of environmental issues, and he blends idealism and compassion with realistic expectations. He is clearly a man who lives what he believes: "The bottom line is, we all gotta live here."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Environmentalism as a personal philosophy has earned the support of top athletes in the world of action sports. O'Brien, even more empowered by parenthood, faithfully espouses conservation of natural resources: "Environmental issues are important to me because I really love the planet. I love nature. I enjoy it, and I respect it. It's in my heart so I don't want it to get ruined."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another top athlete, Andy Macdonald, is a champion skateboarder with "Regime Change in the USA" written on his board's grip tape. He took the bronze in Sunday's Big Air competition as well as in Thursday's Vert contest, and he said during an interview, "If I can set a good example by getting the word out about being environmentally conscious, I'm going to do it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resolutionaries not revolutionaries&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out there is a green rebellion going on at the X Games, and why not? Most of these sports were started by rebels, by social outcasts looking for something fun and meaningful to do, something that didn't require the approval of parents or teachers or other authority figures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Scura declares, "It takes strength and consciousness to be a rebel. Wait. You know what? This isn't a revolution. We're tired of turning around in circles. This is a resolution. We're resolutionaries. Resolving the issues of the world."

<item><language>en</language><title>Accident at Japan nuclear plant</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/accident-at-japan-nuclear-plan/</url><text>
	A fatal accident has killed at least four people at the Mihama nuclear power plant in Japan. There was no leak of radioactivity but it is the deadliest accident in a catalogue of nuclear scandals in Japan.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Fishermen in front of the Mihama nuclear plant after the 1991 accident at the plant. Now a second accident has claimed the live of at least four workers. Alternative energy sources like wind and solar would have avoided this pollution and death.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven workers were also injured due to the steam leak, possibly
caused by a lack of cooling water in the reactor. This latest
accident follows the explosion at Tokaimura plant in 1999, where
workers mixed radioactive material in a bucket, causing a reaction
that killed two workers, injured several more and irradiated
hundreds of civilians. In 1997 also at Tokaimura a fire and
explosion released radioactive gas into the atmosphere. In 1995 a
serious accident at the Monju fast breeder reactor led to its shut
down. In 1991 another reactor at the same Mihama plant suffered a
serious radioactive leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is heavily reliant on dangerous nuclear power for its
electricity. While the government recklessly backs the nuclear
industry come what may, public opposition to nuclear power is
growing due the appalling safety record of the industry. Tokyo
Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is still trying to recover from the
recent scandal it caused by falsifying safety inspections, which
forced it to shut down all of its 17 nuclear reactors. Kansai
Electric Power Company, the owner of Mihama, was also implicated in
that scandal. TEPCO has also just shutdown a nuclear power
generation unit at its Fukushima-Daini plant because of a water
leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansai Electric was also at the centre of a nuclear scandal in
1999, when nuclear fuel delivered by British Nuclear Fuels was
found to contain falsified safety data. The resultant scandal set
back Japan's plans to use large amounts of plutonium as fuel in its
reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's nuclear reactors are ageing - many are almost 30 years
old. Rather than increasing safety measure and closing old reactors
the government is doing the exact opposite - reducing regulation of
the industry. As nuclear power is so expensive many of the
generating companies have huge debts and have cut plant safety
measures to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, hundreds of billions of yen are being sought
to cover the costs of a new plutonium reprocessing plant at
Rokkasho-mura in northern Japan, which is hugely uneconomic,
environmentally polluting, and increases the risk of nuclear
proliferation in east Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there remain many uncertainties as to the exact cause of
this accident at Mihama, one thing is certain - there will be more
and worse to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This avoidable loss of life comes on the 59th anniversary of the
dropping of the US nuclear bomb on the Japanese city of
Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the legacy of Nagasaki, this Mihama accident, the
appalling safety record of the nuclear industry, and with low
public trust in the country's nuclear program, the government and
industry is pressing ahead with more new nuclear power plants and
new nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives sources of energy, such as wind, are not only safe,
but are also cleaner and cheaper than nuclear power. A suitable
response to these deaths would be the ditching of the dangerous,
expensive and polluting menace of nuclear power in favour of
alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

	Following a meeting yesterday with the Norwegian Transport Minister, Ford Europe has confirmed it will not scrap its US fleet of zero emission electric cars, but instead send them to eager customers in Norway.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-reverses-plans-to-crush-a.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/ford-reverses-plans-to-crush-a.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ford reverses plans to crush all its electric Th!nk cars. Ford had planned on crushing this environmental solution because it succeeded in trashing the California legislation that encouraged their use.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford was planning to scrap their US fleet of electric Th!nk
vehicles,but following pressure from us and other environmental
groups, the carmanufacturer has changed its mind. Last month, our
activists occupiedthe roof of Ford Norway's offices, prompting
Norwegian Transport andCommunications Minister Torild Skogsholm to
ask Ford to Th!nk again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 300 of the cars will now be shipped to Norway, and sold
throughFord dealerships to eager customers. Ford has even thanked
Greenpeacefor having brought this issue to their attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford had attempted to justify scrapping the cars by citing a
lack ofUS government regulation, and have since claimed that some
180 of thecars have already been scrapped. This was despite the
Th!nk car'spopularity with American consumers - there's been
waiting lists to buythe cars since the hugely popular leasing
period started in 2001.Zero-emission cars reduce urban smog, and
when charged by electricityfrom renewable sources, they help fight
the biggest threat to ourplanet: climate change. With rising oil
prices causing increasedgasoline costs, they are also a sound
economic choice. Popular, cleanand efficient, shouldn't this be
part of the future of transport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's initial U-turn - which highlights how ludicrous the
originalplan to crush the electric cars was - took little over a
week. Weannounced it on September 1st, and it has taken another two
weeks toget confirmation. The first batch of cars is due to arrive
in Norway inNovember, thanks to shipping company Wallenius
Wilhelmsen, with morecars to follow in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is all good news, it seems this corporate leopard
doesn'tchange its oily spots so easily. Ford still has the most
fossil fuelhungry fleet of cars in the US. In the same week it
reversed thecrushing decision, Ford CEO Bill Ford wrote a letter to
Californiagovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposing a proposed law
that wouldencourage purchases of the most fuel-efficient cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not scrapping electric cars is a start, Ford should now
befocusing on is producing environmentally friendly, zero
emissionvehicles for the mass market. Currently the company likes
to market agreen image even though its current fleet of cars is
actually lessefficient than the 80-year-old Model-T Ford!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford should stop hiding behind empty talk about experimental
fuelcells, and instead do as Henry Ford would have done;
continuouslyimprove efficiency and establish mass production of the
most advancedzero emissions technology available today - modern
battery electricvehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

	Google, Cisco and HP are some of the best-known brands in our updated Cool IT leaderboard. This year saw these companies and other top information technology (IT) firms side with the planet, many for the first time, in some of the most important climate legislative and policy debates. But while some are beginning to get the message, other companies are failing to seize the chance to support strong governmental action that will lead to increased business opportunities for their climate solution offerings.

&lt;p&gt;The IT industry is in a unique position to innovate energy and transport solutions, cut their carbon footprint, and advocate for strong government policies on climate – so we use these as our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Leaderboard-scoring-criteria/"&gt;key criteria for scoring&lt;/a&gt; each company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/"&gt;fourth version of the Cool IT leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, was released at the UNFCCC meeting in Cancun, Mexico today. The separation between IT climate leaders and laggards is especially clear in the Leaderboard's scoring for climate advocacy. Examples of note include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Sony/"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; Europe joined &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Google/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to support the European Union's attempt to establish an ambitious target of 30 percent greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2020, while &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Intel/"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/IBM/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; received penalty points for being part of Business Europe’s opposition to this target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google, with support from &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Cisco/"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/HP/"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, successfully helped to counter California's Proposition 23 ballot measure, a failed attempt by oil interests to derail the state's landmark global warming law, known as the "California Global Warming Solutions Act."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Fujitsu/"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt; scored high marks for its presentation of twelve specific climate and clean energy policy recommendations to the Japanese government, which is considering a law to reduce greenhouse gas emission 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, while the rest of the Japanese IT companies remained silent (and received a negative advocacy penalty). The IT trade lobby JEITA opposed this draft legislation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The most forward looking IT companies scored higher because they recognize that they will gain from a low carbon world," said Greenpeace energy policy analyst Gary Cook. "The sector is happy to talk about its potential to lower carbon emissions by 15 percent by 2020, but thus far, IT companies are still taking an incremental approach instead of providing transformative solutions at the scale and speed for which they are known. The corporate sector, and particularly IT, must work today, not tomorrow, to change the status quo and intervene at important junctures to speak up for strong climate and energy policy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this version of the Cool IT Leaderboard, first, second and third place go to Cisco, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/coolit-leaderboard/Ericsson/"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, and Fujitsu. Cisco’s #1 rank reflects the company’s recognition of a clear opportunity to make IT climate solutions an increasingly core part of its business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Bacon once wrote that a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds. If the IT industry truly embrace the opportunity that faces them, they could deliver transformative climate solutions and be a formidable advocate for the sort of climate policies that will create demand for these products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the green economy won't just evolve naturally from today's fossil fuel-dependent one. The energy revolution requires everyone with an interest in a clean energy future to get on board and make it happen. IT firms are perfectly placed to lead the way.&lt;/p&gt;

	Sweden is, by and large, seen as a pretty smart country.  One of the smart things they did, 30 years ago, was vote by national referendum to ban construction of new nuclear power plants and phase out of the ones they have. Now that wisdom is under threat.

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to increase energy efficiency and build renewable energy (like solar, wind and hydro power) while getting rid of dirty nuclear. Lately though, the nuclear industry has been dressing itself up as eco-friendly - trying to pretend it's something it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, it looks like the politicians might be buying it. There's a vote this week in the parliament on whether to lift the ban - probably in favour of a "one off, one on" policy. A new nuclear power station would be allowed to come online whenever an old one goes offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a country like Sweden, that would be surprisingly short sighted because any new plant will run for decades – building up piles of deadly nuclear waste the whole time. Not to mention the cost. A new, supposedly "modern" nuclear power station in neighbouring Finland is already billions of euros over budget (and years behind schedule), with the company trying to get tax payers to pick up the tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Risking arrest and looking silly to protest the stupidity of nuclear power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 08:30 this morning 40 activists, dressed as renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind and water, entered the Forsmark nuclear power plant about two hours drive north from Stockholm. Two paragliders also circled the plant with banner messages demanding Swedish politicians ‘Vote no to new nuclear power’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but two of the protesters have so far been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ludvig Tillman, energy campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world is watching. Swedish parliamentarians must let reason guide their choice rather than propaganda from the nuclear industry and vote NO to nuclear power on June 17."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular nuclear plant was singled out for our protest for its particularly dodgy history. In 2006, the plant shut down after an electricity fault, and some say a meltdown was avoided by "pure luck".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a comfortable place to be dressed as a windmill.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists are out in the cold, rainy fog of Alaska's Tongass forest today in the area's first forest rescue station, trying to stop the Texan chainsaws of George W. Bush.  Ever predictable, the US president has broken promises in order to line the pockets of big industry.  Greenpeace USA, Inc. is doing something about it.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists and local residents stop roadbuilding and timber operations to protect the Tongass National Forest.  George Bush wants them out of his way so he can hand the forest over to the timber industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tongass was supposed to be protected by one of the most
popular conservation rules in American history: the Roadless Rule.
But Bush has decided to rewrite it with a pen borrowed from logging
interests. On Christmas Eve of last year, Bush took 9 million acres
of Alaska's Tongass National Forest out of the public domain and
put them under the Christmas tree for the forest industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Tongass is the crown jewel of the national forest system, a
place of international significance, and it is threatened by Bush's
agenda which makes no economic or ecological sense" said Jeremy
Paster, Greenpeace USA Forest Campaigner. "Like the Brazilian
rainforest of the Amazon, this American rainforest in Alaska must
be protected and restored."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace forest campaigners monitoring the situation from
Washington DC report that the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, is
also making its way to the protest site and is being spotted by a
US Coast Guard helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The people pay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging on public lands consistently loses taxpayer money. On
August 1, The Washington Post reported on the shrinking market for
Tongass wood, logs being left to rot, and gross mismanagement of
the Tongass Timber program. &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31070-2004Jul31.html"&gt;
("Reopening Forest Areas Stirs Debate in Alaska")&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002
alone, the US government took in just US$ 1.2 million in the timber
program after spending US$ 36 million, a loss of US $34.8 million.
The site of today's peaceful protest, an area called the Finger
Point Timber Sale, will cost US taxpayers more than US$
600,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Activists blocks road with rainforest in background" title="Activists and local residents stop logging in an area of the Alaskan rainforest. In the background is the pristine forest that is threatened with logging since the Bush administration overturned forest protection laws." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="65156"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Four
years ago, candidate Bush promised the American people that he
would uphold the laws protecting America's forests," Paster
continued. "President Bush has betrayed his promise in order to
line the pockets of the timber industry. It's time for people to
stand up, to draw a line in the sand and to rescue our forests from
Bush's chainsaw massacre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-July, the Bush administration moved to eliminate the &lt;a href="http://usactions.greenpeace.org/action/start.php?action_id=19"&gt;
Roadless Rule nationwide&lt;/a&gt; a proposal that threatens the entire
58.5 million acres of the USA's pristine roadless areas in national
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a candidate, President Bush promised to be an environmental
president and uphold the Roadless Rule. However, since taking
office he has proven to be the worst environmental president in US
history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for an immediate national moratorium on
large-scale commercial logging and road construction on federal
forests that are under the administration of the US Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management.&lt;/p&gt;

	We warned the Thai government over a year ago not to play with genetically engineered (GE) papaya but they didn't listen. Although trials of the engineered food crop are banned, it seems they couldn't resist having a go themselves. Now they have left the whole country's papaya crop wide open to contamination.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/7/greenpeace-thai-activists-seal.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Thai activists seal off the GE papaya at the  Khon Kaen agricultural research station of the Department of Agriculture.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent laboratory tests carried out in Hong Kong showed
that packages of papaya seeds being sold by the Department of
Agriculture's research station in the province of Khon Kaen
contained GE seeds. We identified one of the fields at the research
station as the source of the GE seeds. It turns out that the
experimental field was only segregated from the other papaya by
barbed wire and banana trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is potentially one of the worst cases of genetic
contamination of a major food crop in Asia as this station is one
of the largest suppliers of papaya seeds in the country," said
Varoonvarn Svangsopakul, our GE campaigner in Southeast Asia. "This
is the hard evidence we needed to prove that GE contamination has
broken in Thailand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt=" Greenpeace activists dressed in protective suits began removing the GE papaya fruit from the trees and securing them in hazardous material containers inside the field trial site.." border="0" vspace="4" align="left" item_id="64499"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thai activists sealed off the GE papaya at the agricultural
research station of the Department of Agriculture. Dressed in
protective suits they removed the GE papaya fruit from the trees
then secured them in hazardous material containers. They also
demanded that the government complete this process and immediately
destroy all papaya trees, fruit, seedlings, and seeds in the Khon
Kaen research station to prevent further contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of the ban on field trials imposed in 2001 was to
prevent GE contamination. But we now have proof that not only has
this ban failed, but the Department of Agriculture itself has
committed a crime that threatens an essential food with widespread
contamination," said Svangsopakul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/features/details?item_id=290584"&gt;
Last year&lt;/a&gt; we warned the Thai public of the environmental and
health risks posed by GE papaya and called on the government to
stop all planting of the crop anywhere in the country. We also
pointed to Hawaii as an example of GE papaya gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GE papaya was introduced into Hawaii the biotech industry
said it was a 'solution' to the papaya ringspot virus problem. But
instead it has caused serious environmental and economic problems
for farmers. The selling price of GE papaya has fallen to 30-40
percent below production costs, and the price that farmers get for
their GE papaya is 600 percent lower than the price for organic
papaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of growing GE papaya in Thailand are feared to
be even more serious than Hawaii. Not only is green papaya eaten as
a daily staple food, it is also grown everywhere - in farmers'
fields, schoolyards and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've been calling for an end to this genetic experiment on the
grounds that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are
uncontrollable. There can no longer be any doubt that this is true.
And the government must take action to stop this experiment now,"
said Jiragorn Gajaseni, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast
Asia. "The government must act now to impose a total ban on GE
field trials, including those in government restricted areas and
experimental stations, and must launch an investigation into this
environmental crime."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Increased Contamination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our campaigners in Thailand have revealed that genetically
engineered (GE) papaya has been grown for at least 12 months on a
farm in the province of Khon Kaen in a widening GE contamination
scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent laboratory test results dated 24 June 2004 show that
the fruit of a papaya tree on a local farmer's land is GE. The GE
papaya tree is 12 months old and was grown from papaya seeds
purchased from the government research station in June 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All farmers who have purchased papaya seeds from the research
station have a right to know whether GE papaya trees are growing on
their land and whether their families are already eating GE papaya.
Farmers such as this one is a victim of the environmental crime
committed by the Department of Agriculture, " said Jiragorn
Gajaseni, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

	By now it ought to be obvious to anyone - if we want bluefin tuna tomorrow we need to stop catching them today. But despite the clear scientific evidence and predictions of the bluefin's demise - our activists faced a 2 hour confrontation at sea today when they took action to ensure fish for the future. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We  launched the non-violent direct action from our two ships, the Arctic  Sunrise and the Rainbow Warrior, to free bluefin tuna from a large cage  bound for a Mediterranean tuna farm. A dramatic two-hour scene ensued  with fishermen firing flares and threatening activists with knives.  Meanwhile the Maltese Navy joined the fray firing water cannons from a  ship and surveying with a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 7 inflatable boats  activists attempted to release tuna from the cage as the Arctic Sunrise  went on top of the net to lower it. But with the bluefin tuna fishermen  intent on protecting their short-term profits and the Maltese navy more  keen to defend private interests than the future of this fishery - it  became impossible for us to release the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time out for tuna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We  are taking action in the Mediterranean because governments are failing  to do so. Releasing bluefin tuna is the only responsible thing to do,  for the future of the fish and the future of our oceans. We will  confront any and all parts of the Mediterranean bluefin fishery, the  most visible example of how politics and fisheries management are  failing our oceans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 80 percent of bluefin stocks are  estimated to have been fished out of the Mediterranean since industrial  fishing in this area began. Ranching  operations, like the one Greenpeace confronted today, fatten tuna in  order to maximize profits, and continue to increase demand for  endangered bluefin tuna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The European Commission did order some  large-scale bluefin fishing vessels back to port early (because they had  aggressively fished their quota in just a few days), but that's hardly  enough when the science tells us NO fishing should take place on such an  endangered stock.&lt;/p&gt;

The International  Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the fisheries  management body responsible for pushing bluefin to the brink of  extinction, must also prove itself capable of being more than an  “international disgrace.” That particular compliment came from an  independent review ICCAT itself commissioned in 2009. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have  been sounding the alarm on the state of Mediterranean tuna stocks for  years. We will continue to take non-violent, direct action until  governments live up to their responsibility to safeguard the future of  these fish and the livelihoods that depend on them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the  bluefin tuna spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico are accidentally  devastated by the oil spill - the bluefin in the Mediterranean are being  intentionally obliterated by industrial fishing. &lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/Save-the-bluefin-tuna-of-the-Mediterranean"&gt;Take  action to protect the bluefin here by calling for the creation of a  marine reserve in a key region of the Med.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest edition of the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics exposes the widening gap between companies that make good on their promises to clean up, and those that don't. While some of the top electronics manufacturers are failing to keep their environmental commitments, others are innovating and making significant gains in phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing energy efficiency, and making it easier for consumers to recycle old products.

&lt;h3&gt;Greener TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applaud &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; for releasing the first TV free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The &lt;em&gt;Econova TV&lt;/em&gt; puts Philips on track to meet its commitment to phase out these hazardous substances by the end the year, well ahead of other TV manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing gulf between companies that are consistently innovating and leading by releasing greener products and companies that just make big promises and excuses. As they say in the software business: you've either shipped or you haven't.  By launching a PVC- and BFR-free TV, Philips has overcome the technical hurdles to removing these toxic substances from this product group. There is now no excuse for other TV manufacturers not to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The dangers of PVC and BFRs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some BFRs, used in circuit boards and plastic casings, do not break down easily and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure can lead to impaired learning and memory functions. They can also interfere with thyroid and oestrogen hormone systems and exposure in the womb has been linked to behavioural problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC is a plastic used in some electronics products and for insulation on wires and cables. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when PVC is produced or disposed of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/multimedia/photo-essays/Scraplife---e-waste-in-Pakistan/"&gt;by incineration (or simply burning)&lt;/a&gt;. These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and many are toxic even in very low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lots more PVC- and BFR-free products&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New products free of PVC and BFRs have been put on the shelves by &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Acer/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian companies Wipro and HCL, and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/HP/"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, which now has several lines of notebooks, desktops and most recently a PVC-free printer. In contrast, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Toshiba/"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/LG/"&gt;LGE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Samsung/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Dell/"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Lenovo/"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; still have no whole PC product lines free from these substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba is served a second penalty point this year for misleading its customers about its commitments and a first penalty point is imposed on &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for backtracking on commitments to remove these toxic substances. Several other companies continue to be weighed down by penalty points for failing to meet their phase out commitments, including LGE, Samsung, Dell and Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple takes the biggest drop, not because it has lost any points but because several other companies have overtaken it. LGE and Toshiba, both previously amongst the leaders, now take 14th and 16th place, showing that in this fast moving and innovative  sector that standing still is just not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scores on Waste and Recycling show the least progress overall, Panasonic is rewarded for initiating voluntary take-back and recycling of its TVs in India, the first programme of its kind for TVs outside the OECD and another first for TVs. However, the industry as a whole is failing to expand current take-back programmes to achieve global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panasonic is stepping up to the challenge of taking responsibility for its end-of-life TVs – but further company initiatives to take-back and recycle e-waste outside the rich world are desperately needed; Panasonic’s programme could jump start this process.&lt;/p&gt;

	Four activists took action today, climbing 39 metres over the water at the deepwater oil rig “Centenario”, off the coast of the State of Veracruz, in Mexico. The activists scaled the rig early this morning to call for an end to deepwater drilling. The message on the banner? Go Beyond Oil.

            Activists call for an end to deepwater drilling and send a message to all countries meeting at the UN Climate Summit:It is time to end our addiction to fossil fuels.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster exposed the long list of problems with deepwater drilling. It exposed the lack of technical competence to prevent and deal with a deepwater emergency and the greed of the big oil companies that trade security for larger revenues. A spill similar to the Deepwater Horizon disaster would devastate Mexican coasts and threaten wildlife including thousands of whales and dolphins. Despite the devastation, there has been no ban on the drilling and business as usual has resumed in the shameless pursuit of oil to feed our addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil rig our activists are occupying is chartered by PEMEX and is currently conducting geophysics, geotechnical explorations and testing the deepwater drilling technology. There are plans for a new deepwater rig (&lt;em&gt;Bicentenario&lt;/em&gt;) to join this one by the end of 2010 or beginning of 2011 to start exploring oil in the Cinturon Plegado Perdido, an oilfield close to the US border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this has to happen. We have the chance to go beyond oil by launching an Energy Revolution, by ending fossil fuel subsidies, increasing the support for clean energy and launching strong laws and policies that limit global warming pollution – all that is needed is the political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than one week before the start of the UN Climate Summit in Cancun, politicians need to realize that we need more ambitious targets and investments in renewable energies in order to combat climate change. Our governments have the choice to lead the world to a clean energy future, safe from the ravages of climate chaos or continue towards energy dependency and fossil fuel addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: &lt;span&gt;All of the activists are back on the Arctic Sunrise! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; The activists are safe and on the ship as it heads to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the port of Veracruz, Mexico.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved and be a part of the action yourself? Join a ship yourself! Our virtual ship, the Energy [R]evolution will soon need &lt;strong&gt;a team of passionate virtual crew members&lt;/strong&gt; to campaign for clean energy solutions.

	AREVA, the French nuclear energy company, admitted Friday that their contract to ship nuclear waste to Russia has been halted four years early, ending this July. 

Transports we have tirelessly highlighted, taken action against and lobbied to have ended. But , where to now with all their dangerous waste? AREVA says it plans to let the, ahem, "stocks" build up in their facilities at home.

&lt;p&gt;For Greenpeace campaigners, activists, and supporters, it's a well-earned occasion to celebrate and reflect on over 25 years of efforts to expose and oppose these scandalous nuclear waste shipments to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract between AREVA and the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom was due to expire in 2014. However, the Russians have decided to end the collaboration, which began in 1972, effective 11 July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month our ship the Esperanza pursued the Russian transport ship Kapitan Kuropte, on its way to Russia carrying nuclear waste from France. Activists in rubber boats got along side the ship displaying banners reading "Russia is not a nuclear dump", before being sprayed with water canons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in St. Petersburg too, when the Kapitan Kuropte arrived with its hazardous cargo. Greenpeace activists unfurled a banner reading "Stop Nukes", drawing more public attention to AREVA's nuclear waste as it arrived in the historic Russian port, on the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally AREVA and Rosatom won't mention the fever pitch of international controversy that surrounded their nuclear waste shipments. On Friday their spokespeople &lt;a href="http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/areva-says-it-will-halt-depleted-uranium-shipments-to-russia_71832.html" target="_new"&gt;told journalists&lt;/a&gt; basically the same story: we planned to stop this year anyway, nothing to see, please move along. But this letter (PDF document) from Russia's energy minister confirms that the uranium shipment contract had four more years to run, until 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nuclear waste shipments exposed by Greenpeace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, following the sinking of the freighter Mont Louis off Zeebrugge (Belgium), Greenpeace discovered that the ship was carrying containers of uranium hexafluoride. We uncovered a massive scandal: without public scrutiny or knowledge, France had been shipping nuclear waste to Russia since 1972. It's taken more than a generation of campaigning and investigation to raise enough awareness and pressure to finally stop the shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A documentary aired on the pan-European TV station ARTE in October 2009, &lt;a href="http://www.arte.tv/fr/2766888.html" target="_new"&gt;"Waste: The Nuclear Nightmare"&lt;/a&gt;, catapulted the issue of AREVA's nuclear waste onto centre stage in France. AREVA's story was so unconvincing that it prompted the French Minister of Environment and Energy to call upon the High Committee for Transparency and Information on Nuclear Safety to begin a formal investigation. Originally scheduled for January 2010, the results of this investigation will now be made public by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AREVA's lies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since they were first exposed by Greenpeace, AREVA's only defense has been to argue that the nuclear waste sent to Russia was in fact be returned to France as fuel for French nuclear power stations. Uranium is shipped to Russia, enriched, and returned – that's their official line. But it's not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rosatom representative speaking formally to the High Committee investigation in France let slip in November 2009, that adioactive materials from France are not intended to be re-enriched. It's waste, and around 90 percent of it never comes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior official of France's Ministry of Environment and Energy &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266521/rapport-hctisn-france-russie.pdf"&gt;has provided figures (PDF document, French)&lt;/a&gt; on the final material flows between France and Russia between 2006 and late 2009: 32,200 tons of waste was exported to Russia, while only 3,090 tons of materials came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Greenpeace welcomes decision to stop the scandalous and immoral transporting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporting radioactive waste to Russia is contrary to Russian environmental law, which bans the importation of nuclear waste. It is also contrary to the &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:337:0021:0032:EN:PDF"&gt;European Directive of 2006 (PDF document)&lt;/a&gt; on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European law states that the sender of nuclear waste must ensure that the waste will be stored and processed under safe conditions in the country of destination. Today, neither AREVA nor EDF, or even the French authorities, are able to monitor security conditions in Russia, as confirmed by the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;To end the nuclear age&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear waste is produced at every stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining and enrichment, to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Much of this nuclear waste will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years, leaving a deadly legacy to future generations. And, so the struggle for a green and peaceful future continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us, this latest story confirms that persistence and nonviolently bearing witness pays off in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to stop an oil gush? Keep it in the ground. If you think that's impractical, or that it means shivering in the dark, or millions of people without energy, or millions of people without jobs, you'd be forgiven for thinking that. It's the line that we've all been fed by Big Oil and King Coal. It's wrong on all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace teamed up with more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry to create our Energy [R]evolution Scenario. Using only existing technologies, it charts a course by which we can get from where we are now, to where we need to be: &lt;strong&gt;decreasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions after 2015; 95% renewable electricity by 2050; a phase out of nuclear power; 12 million jobs by 2030, with a third more jobs in the global power supply sector&lt;/strong&gt; than in a business as usual scenario. The scenario respects natural limits, decouples growth from fossil fuel use, and proposes an investment system in which costs are shared fairly under a global climate regime. It also means finally &lt;strong&gt;providing energy to the two billion people currently without reliable access to energy services&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="energy revolution" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about the Energy [R]evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why a [R]evolution? It's an evolution, AND a revolution. (And yes, electronics geeks, that’s the symbol for [r]esistance there as well.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need a [r]evolution because business as usual is not going to stop the tens of thousands of barrels of &lt;strong&gt;crude oil spilling into our waters, scores of workers losing their lives to accidents in coal mines&lt;/strong&gt; around the world, or the countless other disasters we are all facing due to our reliance on dirty energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Energy [R]evolution scenario outlines how to &lt;strong&gt;create about 12 million jobs, with 8.5 million in the renewables sector alone, by 2030&lt;/strong&gt;. If we continue under business as usual, global renewable power jobs would be only 2.4 million of the global power sector’s 8.7 million jobs. By implementing the Energy [R]evolution 3.2 million or over 33% more jobs globally will be created in the power sector alone. If that isn’t enough to convince you consider this - the overall annual &lt;strong&gt;market for renewable technology will increase from around US$100 billion today, to more than US$600 billion by 2030.&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Emissions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under the Energy [R]evolution scenario would peak in 2015 and drop afterwards. If compared with 1990, &lt;strong&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions will be more than 80% lower by 2050&lt;/strong&gt; if the energy supply is based almost entirely on renewable energies. By 2050 around 95% of electricity could be produced by renewable energy.&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse Development Rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the Energy [R}evolution will be a change in the way that energy is produced, distributed and consumed. It will also mean connecting the 2 billion people currently living without electricty. &lt;strong&gt;Decentralised energy systems&lt;/strong&gt;, where power and heat are produced close to the point of final use, will avoid the current energy wastage during conversion and distribution. Investments in “climate infrastructure” as well as &lt;strong&gt;super grids to transport large quantities of offshore wind and concentrating solar power,&lt;/strong&gt; are essential to making the Energy [R]evolution a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sustainable future of the planet is rooted in the investment in people and local communities who can install and maintain renewable energy sources, rather than further subsidising dirty and finite fossil fuels. We need to create a system in which &lt;strong&gt;investment costs are shared fairly under a global climate regime&lt;/strong&gt;. One such mechanism is the Greenhouse Development Rights framework (GDR) which calculates national shares of global greenhouse gas obligations based on a combination of responsibility (contribution to climate change) and capacity (ability to pay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Policy changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the Energy [R]evolution a reality and to avoid dangerous climate change, we are demanding the &lt;strong&gt;following policies and actions&lt;/strong&gt; are implemented in the energy sector:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.&lt;br&gt;2. Internalise the external (social and environmental) costs of energy production through 'cap and trade' emissions trading.&lt;br&gt;3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming appliances, buildings and vehicles.&lt;br&gt;4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation.&lt;br&gt;5. Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators.&lt;br&gt;6. Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example by feed-in tariff programmes.&lt;br&gt;7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information.&lt;br&gt;8. Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; border: 0; margin: 4px;" src="http://pewresearch.org/assets/publications/1590-3.gif" alt="Pew Reesearch Center" width="392" height="163"&gt;Despite the decline in support for offshore oil drilling as a result of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, a recent &lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1590/poll-gulf-oil-disaster-obama-bp-support-for-drilling"&gt;Pew Research Center Poll &lt;/a&gt;of the American public shows a *decline* in support for funding for alternative energy as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a decline in support for nuclear we can understand: the failure of multiple safety technologies and the poor response to an ecological emergency are good reasons not to trust a technology that relies on deadly fuel to boil water. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But let's look at those numbers. At 73%, a healthy majority of Americans support more investment in alternatives. So why is the US government not delivering a big time investment in alternatives as a way out of the nightmare of dependence on oil, big oil slicks, pollution, corruption, poisoned fishing grounds, and an energy mix that's choking the future to death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why indeed?&lt;/p&gt;

	A Politician breaking a promise is nothing new. But when a broken promise could be putting the world in danger it's a big deal. Despite promises to sign up to tackle global warming, Russian president Putin seems to be playing roulette with the climate. On Putin's 51th birthday we are reminding him -- through actions in 19 countries -- that he is holding our future in his hands.

            Demanding Putin sign the Kyoto Protocol.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988 politicians started talking seriously about the threat
of global warming and climate change. It took many years of
horse-trading and a lot of hot air to arrive at the first baby step
to tackling global warming - the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. It's now
15 years later and Kyoto has yet to enter into force because the US
is determined to block any international effort to address climate
change. That leaves Russia as the one country that needs to sign to
make the treaty international law. Our activists are delivering
birthday reminders to Putin around the globe urging him to sign up
and start global efforts to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Delivering a birthday reminder for Putin to the Russian Embassy in Thailand." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53407"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
first action of the day was at the Russian embassy in Bangkok where
activists presented the ambassador with a cake in the shape of a
melting Earth. The ambassador repeated that Russia is still
examining the treaty (read 'stalling' as they have had 3 years to
'examine' it already). After exchanging views the activists left
only slightly disappointed that the cake was actually accepted,
thus scuppering their plans to sample some tasty morsels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, and around the clock, Greenpeace activists and
volunteers presented Russian embassy officials with giant pens,
birthday cakes, and other reminders to Putin that he's not getting
any younger, and climate change is not going away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.se/files/2200-2299/file_2247.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;The Russian delay
in signing the treaty is mystifying. The government has previously
promised to sign and Russia stands to gain economically from the
conditions of the treaty. It is quite likely that the US
government, at the urging of its corporate backers like Exxon, is
pressuring Russia not to bring the treaty into force. Or maybe
Putin is paying too much attention to his economic advisors who
claim the treaty will be too expensive for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.se/files/2200-2299/file_2243.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"&gt;In fact the
opposite is true. Russia would gain from the treaty because
industrial decline has lowered its emissions of greenhouse gases
since the collapse of outdated state industries. The impacts of
climate change would have many adverse affects on Russia even if
Putin likes to joke that Russians would have to wear their hats
less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Demanding Russia ratify Kyoto in Brussels" title="Demanding Russia ratify Kyoto in Brussels" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="53416"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Our
climate campaigner, Steven Guilbeault, explains: "Climate change is
becoming a reality in many parts of the globe and Russia is no
exception. Permafrost, which covers approximately 2/3 of Russian
territory, is showing signs of melting. This will damage forests,
pipelines, buildings and other infrastructure. Productivity in the
agriculture sector could be reduced between 10 - 40 percent.
Infectious diseases like West Nile Virus and Dengue Fever are
likely to affect more and more Russians in the decades to
come."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="53404"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;No
doubt Russians might not find it as funny as Putin does if they
swap their hats for more expensive food, damaged infrastructure and
extra helpings of infectious diseases. Kyoto will not alone solve
the problem of climate change but it does mark a historic first
step in international efforts to combat a problem that affects us
all. Let's hope Putin doesn't chop the legs off these first global
efforts before a first step is even taken.&lt;/p&gt;

	Weapons inspector David Kay - the head of the "Iraq Survey Group" and hawkish pro-war cheerleader prior to the US attack - reports that the US has failed to find evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. A version of Kay's interim report had been expected to be publicly released. But the negative findings have driven the report behind a cloak of secrecy, with only a sanitized presentation to Congress made public. And efforts to evade public scrutiny have included evading the scrutiny by UN-mandated inspectors, still excluded from Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace scientist Dr. Rianne Teule measures radioactive levels of a device from the nearby Tuwaitha nuclear facility. The device, abandoned on a roadside,  contains uranium oxide powder that is 1000 times background levels of radiation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when asked
to comment on Friday, stated that it has not been given a copy of
the classified report or the detailed findings of the US team. Like
the rest of us, the IAEA has access only to Kay's public testimony
to Congress, as posted on the CIA's web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations still has an inspection mandate in Iraq under
the terms of Security Council Resolution 1441 and the terms of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which means the US is
required to provide all information regarding weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq to the IAEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Gwozdecky, a spokesman for the IAEA, stated: "We cannot
comment on Dr. Kay's report without access to the detailed findings
of his group".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gwozdecky further stated that: "We therefore expect that Dr.
Kay's findings will be shared with us in accordance with paragraph
10 of Security Council resolution 1441 and this will enable us to
fulfil our responsibilities".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions, and
its alleged failure to reveal information concerning weapons of
mass destruction, were among the top reasons given by the US as
justifications for invading Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hans Blix, former head of the UN's hunt for chemical and
biological weapons in Iraq, has warned against "another epidemic of
spin" by the US and UK on the heels of the Kay report. Commenting
to &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt; newspaper, Blix said that nothing found
by the Iraq Survey Group validated the "serious and current threat"
presented by the US and UK before going to war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuing exclusion of the IAEA from Iraq by the USA
represents a major breach of international law and exacerbates a
dangerous situation. A Greenpeace mission to Baghdad in June
revealed the US had been criminally lax in securing nuclear
materials from looting. Near the Tuwaitha nuclear installation, we
found 4-5 kilograms of uranium oxide (yellow cake)-- incapable of
being used in nuclear weapons but a radioactive hazard -- alongside
a roadway, radiation sources 3000 times above normal "background"
levels near schools, and individual homes with radiation "sources"
up to 10,000 times over normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impoverished local residents had taken 55-gallon drums from the
facility to use as stoves and for water storage, in some cases
dumping out nuclear materials unaware that dangerous radioactivity
remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US efforts to secure oil wells were far more intensive than
those to protect the IAEA-monitored nuclear facility, which went
unguarded in the immediate aftermath of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The US government is exhibiting extreme schizophrenic behaviour
with regards to weapons of mass destruction" said Tom Clements of
Greenpeace. "They're violating UN Security Council resolutions by
refusing access to UN inspection teams, basically doing a very good
imitation of the behaviour of Saddam Hussein. On top of that,
Bush's own provocative rush to create new weapons of mass
destruction is proceeding through the Congress".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Senate recently approved research to proceed on "bunker
busters" -- earth-penetrating mini-nukes -- one-fifth the size of
the Hiroshima bomb of 20,000 tonnes of dynamite. At the same time,
lawmakers also voted to allow the US Department of Energy to get
ready for nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site and to continue
planning for a new factory that would build the plutonium "pits,"
or cores of all nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear arms race is back, thanks to George Bush's decision
to break into a sprint. And it won't be long until the rest of the
pack decides it needs to keep up. Russian Defence Minister Sergei
Ivanov &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3159044.stm"&gt;stated last
week&lt;/a&gt; that Russia "would not rule out a pre-emptive military
strike anywhere in the world if the national interest demands it,"
confirming that the US precedent of embracing pre-emptive
war-fighting strategies has now become the worldwide standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell US Secretary of State Colin Powell that it's time the US
honoured Security Council Resolution 1441 and allowed UN weapons
inspectors back into Iraq. Given that David Kay's Iraq Survey Group
has failed to find any sign of weapons of mass destruction, UN
inspectors should be allowed immediately back in to proceed with
their work and report on their findings. Failure to allow the UN
inspectors back in will further erode US credibility and raise
legitimate questions about why the US is afraid to let the UN's
work be concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new policy commits Nestlé to identify and exclude companies from its supply chain that own or manage 'high risk plantations or farms linked to deforestation'. This would apply to notorious Sinar Mas, a palm oil and paper supplier that Greenpeace has repeatedly caught destroying the rainforest - if it fails to meet Nestlé's new criteria - and also have implications for Cargill, one of Nestlé's palm oil suppliers which purchases from Sinar Mas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nestle.com/media/mediaeventscalendar/allevents/2010-nestle-open-forum-on-deforestation-malaysia" target="_blank"&gt;Nestlé's announcement&lt;/a&gt; sends a strong message to the palm oil and paper industry that rainforest destruction is not an acceptable practice in today's global marketplace - and it wouldn't have happened without you. From the very beginning, the strength of our Kit Kat campaign has been the truly amazing support from the public - online and offline - both concerned consumers and social media-savvy activists alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support from the online community has been clear since day one when our 'Have a break?' video's removal from YouTube sparked online calls of censorship, several spin-off uploads to YouTube, and drove hundreds of thousands of views on the video within hours of it being re-uploaded to Vimeo - the total number of views on all versions of the video is now over 1.5 million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook was another key online arena for the Kit Kat campaign, where a steady stream of pressure was applied to Nestlé via comments you left on its Facebook Fan page. While many of you also 'wore your support on your sleeve' Facebook-style by changing your profile pictures to images of orang-utans, rainforest, and our campaign Kit Kat 'killer' logo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of social media combined dramatically with our direct actions to deliver the message directly to Nestlé at events like its Annual General Meeting on April 15th. Outside the meeting venue, shareholders were greeted by protesting orang-utans as they arrived, while inside our activists hid in the ceiling in order to drop down over shareholders heads just as the meeting began to deploy banners asking Nestlé to give orang-utans a break. Online our supporters were sending tweets to shareholders throughout the meeting via a fake Wi-Fi network we had set up, which sent shareholders directly to greenpeace.org/kitkat when they connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online and offline the message to Nestlé has been strong and relentless over the past two months - give rainforests and orang-utans a break. All of it - from protesting orang-utans on the streets to Facebook status updates - has brought us to today's commitment. Congratulations and thank you to everyone who helped us get here - now go on and announce it to the world. Please boast about your involvement in the success of our Kit Kat campaign on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Sweet-success-for-Kit-Kat-campaign/" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=I%20helped%20get%20the%20orangutan%20a%20break!%20Nestle%20to%20remove%20rainforest%20destruction%20from%20supply%20chain:%20http://j.mp/cqVQXo" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - or any of your other social network profiles - you deserve it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our goal remains the complete protection of Indonesia's rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands. We will be watching Nestlé closely to make sure it sticks to its word and puts them into action fast. We will also continue to investigate and expose unscrupulous palm oil and paper companies that destroy rainforests and to pressure the Indonesian government to act. In the meantime, today's new Nestlé 'no deforestation footprint' policy is something to celebrate. We hope it will inspire action by other international companies - like Carrefour and Wal-mart - to hear our message that there is no room for forest destruction in the products we buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let's celebrate our sweet success!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You deserve a huge round of applause for helping us get that well-deserved break for the orang-utan and for Indonesian rainforests! Do some online boasting:&lt;/p&gt;

	As bluefin tuna fishing began in the Mediterranean today, just south of Malta - we set out to rescue endangered fish trapped inside a massive purse seine net. But our boats and activists were met with violence as several fishing vessels closed in on them.

&lt;p&gt;Having found a fishing vessel – the Jean-Marie Christian 6 - towing &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/when-purse-seining-goes-bad/blog/11803"&gt;a purse-seine net&lt;/a&gt;, we launched inflatable boats from our ships the Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise with the intention of submerging one side of the net to free the tuna trapped within. Other tuna vessels in the area immediately confronted and attacked our activists. One activist was seriously injured when the spike of a grappling hook was stabbed straight through his leg. He is now being evacuated for emergency care. Flares were also fired directly at our activists. Two of our inflatable boats were slashed with knives and one sank after being rammed and then run over by fishing vessels. Another inflatable was badly damaged and several of our activists had to be rescued from the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs ignored&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaction of the industrialised North and international regulatory bodies is essentially condeming this key species to extinction. Many, including Greenpeace and leading scientists, have warned for years that without urgent action - the bluefin will disappear. The Med region’s bluefin fishery must be closed immediately to allow bluefin tuna time to recover from decades of overfishing. This decline has been predominately caused by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/when-purse-seining-goes-bad/blog/11803"&gt;the purse seining method of fishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the latest meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to declare a ban on sales of this type of tuna has made the situation even worse. The European governments along with Japan know well that there is abundant and unquestionable evidence of overfishing - yet they once again put shorterm profits before logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are trying to shut down this fishing operation to protect our oceans and the future of the bluefin tuna. We are taking action where politicians and fisheries managers refuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will continue to take non-violent action at sea throughout the rest of the Mediterranean tuna fishing season which ends on June 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the bluefin quota for the Mediterranean Sea be set to zero and that fishing operations targeting the species end immediately. Additionally, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/bluefins-mediterranean-holiday-romance-will-i/blog/11815"&gt;the bluefin spawning grounds, like the Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt;, must be set aside as part of a larger network of protected marine reserves to put the bluefin on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where have all the tuna gone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the assessments of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the current Atlantic bluefin tuna population is less than 15 percent of what it was before the beginning of industrial fishing activities (purse seining). If current fishing rates continue, the bluefin could disappear as a commercial species in just a few years. Globally, over 90 percent of large fish, such as tuna, have disappeared from our oceans, and some scientists warn that all commercial fisheries could collapse in the coming decades. We are demanding that oceans management - including the Mediterranean - be reformed to include a fully-protected network of marine reserves covering 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marine reserves or empty nets forever?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are acting to ensure healthy oceans and ample fish stocks for future generations. And we intend to non-violently confront Mediterranean bluefin fishing vessels in order to get the bluefin off the pathway to extinction and instead put our oceans on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves - areas of ocean off-limits to fishing, mining, drilling and other extractive activities - to cover 40 percent of the world’s oceans, including the Mediterranean. This is a necessary step to restoring our oceans and fish stocks back to health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Action: The &lt;a href="http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3754273"&gt;oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; is threaning the eastern spawning grounds for the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Therefore, it is even more vital that we protect the spawning grounds for this species in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

	The debate on Genetically Modified (GM) crops is often a polarised one with environmentalists and the majority of sceptical consumers against the crops and powerful corporate interests attempting to steamroller all opposition. Now those companies may be in for a serious setback, as scientific tests devised by the UK Government and GM companies look set to say that GM crops are environmentally unsafe.

            GM maize was one of the crops tested in the UK.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaked results of field trials involving 3 GM crops have shown
them to be more harmful to the enviornment than conventional
varieties. The trials involved maize, sugar beet and oilseed rape.
The crops, developed by Monsanto and Bayer, are modified to resist
herbicide produced by the same companies. This allows farmers to
eradicate all weeds from fields of GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the fields treated in the conventional way the GM
trial fields contained much less wildlife because the herbicides
kill all weeds in the fields, leaving no food for farmland insects.
While bugs in crops might not sound so important, they are the
basis of the food chain in agricultural land. So without them it is
not long before songbirds and other larger countryside animals
start to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only GM maize seems to have less effect on wildlife because
conventional maize is treated with herbicides even more powerful
than the Bayer product sprayed on the GM maize. However US farmers
have found that they must spray GM maize with highly toxic
herbicides like Atrazine to stop yields suffering due to weed
competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results will be formally announced on October 16 but if the
leak is accurate it will be a major setback for the GM lobby.
Already the EU health commissioner, David Byrne, has indicated that
a threat to British wildlife from GM crops would be sufficient
grounds for the UK Government to ban the growing of such crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaked results are also significant because Europe is the
centre of genetic diversity for both oilseed rape and sugar beet.
If GM versions of these crops were planted commercially throughout
the EU there would be inevitable and irreversible contamination of
natural biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the ball is firmly in the court of governments like the UK
and the EU. Will they choose for the interests of the public and
the environment or for profits of big business and US Government
bullying?&lt;/p&gt;

	Crowning the Earth and stretching across Russia and Canada, is a wide expanse of forest that comprises the largest ecosystem in the world - the Boreal forest. This northern treasure is a unique mixture of conifers and deciduous trees interspersed with lush wetlands, rushing rivers and calm, clear lakes. Unfortunately, it's disappearing into disposable consumer products.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Canadian boreal forest which is under threat from logging.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this pristine forest being turned into? Mainly paper products like tissues and toilet paper. Yes - one of the world's last great ecosystems is being flushed down the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boreal forest is home to wolves, bears, caribou and thousands of other plant and animal species that are rare or endangered species. As well as being home to countless precious species and indigenous peoples these forests are one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. Bigger than the Amazon, these forests store almost half the Earth's carbon. The forest also holds most of the world's unfrozen fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However these global treasures are under siege. Industrial logging companies and the Russian and Canadian governments see not fantastic ecosystems worth preserving for the health of the planet and future of our children but as billions of dollars of short-term profit. Much of the forest has already been clear-cut or is earmarked for clearance. And what are these magnificent forests being turned into? Half of the wood from Canadian forests is turned into disposable products like facial tissues and toilet paper. Next time you wipe your nose with a tissue or use some super soft toilet paper there is a good chance you are helping deprive a bear cub of a home. Your garden shed could be built with the former home of an endangered eagle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Watch the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.ca/e/action/sendcard/index.php"&gt;animation about the destruction of the Boreal forest and send it&lt;/a&gt; as an ecard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, the Canadian and Russian Boreal forests hold 40 percent of the world's carbon stocks and are thus very important in the fight against global warming and climate change. Boreal forests influence the global climate by taking in carbon dioxide, the gas largely responsible for global warming, from the atmosphere. Deforestation can contribute to the release of carbon to the atmosphere and reduces the ability of forests to store carbon in the future by destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Casey-Lefkowitz of the US group Natural Resources Defence Council puts the blame firmly at the door of the companies: "US and Canadian consumers care where their paper and wood comes from. Our over 1 million members and supporters do not want to see a global treasure like the Boreal lost so that companies can make toilet paper from old-growth trees."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Russia the government is planning to relax laws on government ownership of national forests to allow private companies to buy a possible 843 million hectares. The forests cover 70 percent of Russia and spans 12 time zones. The Government sees the forest sale as a US$164 billion dollar cash bonanza and logging companies are poised to clearcut the forests. Such short-term profiteering risks a long term environmental catastrophe which costs us all far more in loss of species, pristine wilderness and devastating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our campaigner in Russia has been following plans to change the forest ownership plans, "State ownership means the local government and population can negotiate over how to log some areas and protect others. Private ownership means businesses can suit their own agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the logging that takes place in the Boreal forest is clearcutting. Most if not all the trees are cut, de-limbed, and trucked to mills. It eliminates wildlife habitat, future seed sources and old-growth features. Clearcutting is often the most profitable way for large companies to cut a forest down in the short term because the process is highly mechanized. In Canada land use laws actually encourage this destructive practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Saving these forests is perhaps the greatest conservation opportunity in the world today. It is also one of our greatest environmental challenges. You can be part of preserving this legacy for the future. If you consume any wood or paper products you can do something to help preserve the boreal forest:
&lt;p&gt;When you buy pulp and paper products like toilet paper, hand towels and writing paper, make sure they have a high recycled paper content - 100 percent recycled is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for the FSC® (Forest Stewardship Council™) logo on wood and paper products. FSC® is the only guarantee of sustainably managed forests. If you cannot find FSC® products, then ask your retailer to stock them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands Ikea, Home Depot and Staples/Business Depot have all committed to forest-friendly procurement policies. Companies like Kimberly-Clark, Procter and Gamble, Scott Paper and Cascade continue to trash Boreal forests make facial tissue and toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	The UN-sponsored World Forestry Congress is underway in Quebec City, Quebec, and today arriving delegates were greeted with a "clear cut" of tree stumps, as part of Greenpeace's work at the conference to highlight how Canadian forests are being mismanaged by the federal and provincial governments.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Canada claims to be a world leader in protecting our forests, but the reality is that over one third of Canada's Boreal forests have already been allocated to logging companies and in less than 30 years the amount of land clearcut in this country has increased by 40 percent," said Richard Brooks, our Canada forests campaigner. "Canada has an amazing opportunity to protect the most endangered areas of its Boreal forest, but time is running out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 4,000 delegates from over 140 countries are attending the UN-sponsored World Forestry Congress, including representatives from Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Five facts about Canada's Boreal forest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boreal forest in Canada is 529 million hectares or about the size of 21 United Kingdoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of the Boreal forest cut each year is turned into disposables products like toilet and facial tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the Boreal forest is clearcutting. In a clearcutting operation, most if not all the trees are cut, delimbed, and trucked to mills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boreal forests of Canada and Russia hold approximately 40 percent of the planet's terrestrial carbon and so are essential in the fight against climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the past 50 years, while the rate of cutting has increased by 50 percent, the number of people employed in the forest industry has decreased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;May 2010 saw the launch of a historic accord, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/Landmark-pact-reached-to-protect-Canadas-Boreal-Forest1/"&gt;Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement&lt;/a&gt;,  which brings together 9 environmental groups, including Greenpeace and  21 of the largest logging companies in Canada.  The agreement is the  first step towards conservation planning for 70 million hectares of  Boreal wilderness.

	As if George Bush's monumental miscalculation in Iraq wasn't bad enough for the people of Iraq and global security, the Bush regime has now moved one big step closer toward use of nuclear weapons in similar US misadventures.

        &lt;p&gt;
            George Bush leads the US toward a policy of unilateral, pre-emptive counterproliferation warfighting strategy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 16, Bush got his way when the US Senate voted to
allow research into smaller nuclear weapons that could be used in
battlefield situations. The so-called "bunker buster" mini-nukes
would, in theory, be used to destroy command and control bunkers
buried deep underground. Voting to lift a 10-year ban against
research and development of these low-yield battlefield weapons,
the Senate caved in to Pentagon hawks who have actively been
pushing to get their hands on such weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Republican leaders of the Senate claimed the 51-43 vote
(out of 100 senators) was only for research and not actual
development of new weapons, other senators held a contrary view. "I
think there's a very clear march on to develop these weapons," said
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat from California. NGOs against US
nuclear policies provided Senator Feinstein with information that
she used in her floor speech against the funding, to no avail. But
the debate was really not about facts, or about the risk that the
use of nuclear weapons presents to the world, it was rather another
test of ideological loyalty to the new Dr. Strangelove, Donald
Rumsfeld's Pentagon, now under fire for lies and mistruths about
the Iraq war and occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War planners have grown tired of their own theories of deterring
a foe through the threat of use of nuclear weapons. Now eager to
have nuclear weapons available for use, the Mutually Assured
Destruction (MAD) deterrence theory which was the basis for the
Cold War between the US and Soviet Union has quietly been moved to
the back of the Pentagon's war closet. No longer stylish in
Washington, MAD theory - insane in its own right - is giving way to
clear plans to "go nuclear" in future wars. So what if the facts
show that deeply buried bunkers can't be successfully attacked with
the new weapons? Who cares that they would loft tons of deadly
radioactive dirt and debris into the environment? Well, ummm... we
do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear strategy, nuclear madness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can't be said that Bush hasn't been up front about his
intentions. In his National Security Strategy (NSS), issued by the
White House in September 2002, the Administration gloats over its
"unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world"
and clearly links military and economic policies. Stating that the
US goal is to defend "freedom, democracy, and free enterprise" and
bring "free markets, and free trade to every corner of the world,"
the NSS goes on to lay out how the US will act pre-emptively and
unilaterally as part of a new "counterproliferation" policy. Small
nuclear weapons to carry out "first strikes" as part of this new
strategy are but a part of the wider range of military options that
the Pentagon is pursuing. Likewise, the Nuclear Posture Review from
December 2001 also affirms first-strike, pre-emptive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the vote for earth-penetrating mini-nukes - one-fifth
the size of the Hiroshima bomb of 20,000 tonnes of dynamite - the
Senate also voted to allow the US Department of Energy to get ready
for nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site and to continue
planning for a new factory that would build the plutonium "pits,"
or cores of all nuclear weapons. All these projects reveal that a
very dangerous picture has emerged: Bush and his generals are
planning to legitimise the use of nuclear weapons. The appropriate
infrastructure for making new weapons, and rebuilding all the older
deployed weapons - which would be around 2000 warheads in 2012,
with thousands more stored - and for testing of old and new weapons
is now on its way to being put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Look over there! Nukes!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to divert the eyes of the world from what it's up to,
the US has diligently tried to redirect all nuclear proliferation
concern to "rogues" like North Korea and Iran. While the risk of
new countries obtaining nuclear weapons is obvious and must be
addressed, the country with the most aggressive nuclear weapons
policies - and which is trampling not only on the NPT but also
refusing to back the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) - must
likewise be confronted in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that proliferation of nuclear technologies and
materials is accelerating at a rapid pace, the US has taken no
steps to establish the norm that possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable fissile materials is illegitmate. While developing
its new first-strike policies, the US has rejected the concept of
leadership through responsible example. Instead, the US has not
only blatantly ignored its nuclear disarmament obligations under
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but has turned a blind eye to
allies proliferating nuclear technologies and plutonium, the key
ingredient to atomic bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Global peace movement can force disarmament, nonproliferation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, in the midst of the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan
was caught joking during a radio programme sound check about
policies toward the Soviet Union. Reagan laughed into the
microphone, which he didn't know was live, and said "My fellow
Americans, I am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which
outlaws Russia forever. The bombing begins in five minutes." While
it was a frightening and rightly caused a global reaction, in many
ways Reagan's gaffe was educational as it revealed to the world
that nuclear annihilation really was on the mind of a US president
and had to be vigorously challenged. That challenge to US nuclear
policies took the form of the "nuclear freeze," a movement that
contributed in unacknowledged ways to the eventually successful
goal of halting the insane US-Soviet nuclear arms race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the streets protesting Bush's invasion and occupation
in Iraq are modern-day allies of those who marched and protested in
the US and other countries against nuclear weapons. Before things
spin further out of control at the hand of Bush and others bent on
global domination, a global peace movement aimed at curbing the US,
stopping all nuclear weapons and demanding new norms of peaceful
international conduct may well hold the key to a better future. As
we saw in the overwhelming response before the Iraq war, such an
on-going anti-war, anti-nuclear weapons movement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action of the Senate this week shows that for Bush nuclear
war is no joke, rather a calmly planned policy to be put into
practice. We need to let him know that all of us who were out in
the streets in February for the largest anti-war demonstration in
the history of the planet are still watching, and not afraid to
speak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the nukes projects are only beginning, there remains
time for an international outcry to pressure the Bush
Administration to roll back its dangerous plans. Reaction by
countries around the world is thus critical. As the signatory
countries to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will meet at
the United Nations in New York in May 2004, the US can be put in
the hotseat as we head toward this important gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Ask Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and Sweden to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=982&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;continue their fight for a non-nuclear world&lt;/a&gt; at the Non Proliferation Treaty Review Conference by raising their voices NOW against the US move toward weapons and policies that will destabilize our world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	World Oceans Day is a day for us to celebrate our seas and a time for us to honour ocean heroes across the planet. But today - as the trial of two of our anti-whaling campaigners came to an end in Japan - the prosecution asked for Junichi and Toru to be jailed for 18 months. This is an outrageous politically motivated request considering they are absolutely innocent. If imposed this would be the longest jail term for any Greenpeace activist - ever.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, known as the Tokyo Two, were arrested 2  years ago after exposing government corruption at the heart of Japan's  whaling industry. They carried out &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/whaling-on-trial/"&gt;a  public interest investigation into claims made by whistleblowers and  gathered strong evidence to prove their allegations&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/t2trial150210/"&gt;trial  started in February&lt;/a&gt; this year and the case for their defense has  been solid throughout. Despite the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/Tokyo-Two-Trial/"&gt;prosecution  struggling to prove its own arguments&lt;/a&gt; - with contradictory  testimonies from prosecution witnesses who often had to agree with the  defence on key points - a severely disproportionate sentence has been  requested.&lt;/p&gt;

What they did was essential to prove  their allegations. What they did - was honourable and in the public  interest. And even though the United Nations Human Rights Council  Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that the 26-day detention of  Junichi and Toru breached their human rights - the Aomori District  Court Prosecutor demanded they each serve a prison term of one year and  six months for theft and trespass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We acted peacefully and only  in the public interest – to gain evidence of embezzlement of whale meat  paid for by the Japanese public. As a signatory to international human  rights treaties, Japan must uphold our right to take such action and we  trust the court will recognise this in its decision.” -- Junichi Sato. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An  inconvenient opposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/Tokyo-Two-Trial/"&gt;Junichi  and Toru requested an official investigation into their allegations&lt;/a&gt;.  And although this was started - it was dropped without reason by the  authorities while the Tokyo Two were arrested. Their detention,  interrogation and charges have been condemned by international human  rights organisations, legal experts and politicians, including Nobel  Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is deeply worrying that any  jail term might be imposed. Human rights experts have considered this  case to be politically motivated, and another example of a growing  global trend of authorities using the law to silence inconvenient  opposition.” -- Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  demand for jail comes just as crucial talks are to begin at the  International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Morocco. More than  half a million messages of concern have already been sent to the  Japanese government since the Tokyo Two were arrested in June 2008. And &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/End-whaling-NOW/"&gt;thousands  of letters are now being sent to the Foreign Minister of Japan&lt;/a&gt; -  calling for an end to whaling and an end to the prosecution of the  Junichi and Toru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new leadership taking power in Japan  today - they have an opportunity to wipe away two years of inaction by  Japanese leaders. New Prime Minister Naoto Kan needs to prove that he  can do what Yukio Hatoyama could not, and demonstrate that Japan can be a  world leader in defending the rights and importance of civil society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  verdict and final sentencing will take place on 6 September. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending  our Oceans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This World Oceans Day - as the struggle continues to end  whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary - we're also taking action  around the world to defend some of the most fragile and threatened  marine ecosystems on the planet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The crew on board our ship, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/"&gt;Esperanza,  has just finished the first leg of the Arctic Under Pressure Expedition&lt;/a&gt; where they have been working with scientists to set up a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/deploying-mesocosms-79n/blog/12004"&gt;first-of-its-kind  experiment to study the impacts of ocean acidificiation in the Arctic&lt;/a&gt;.  The chemistry of our oceans is changing as more carbon dioxide from  fossil fuels dissolves into the sea - and this impact of carbon dioxide  could threaten marine life just as seriously as climate change. The  Esperanza will continue the expedition in the Arctic by monitoring  fishing vessels in the area which have moved north to exploit new  stocks, which have become accessible now that the sea ice is  disappearing as Arctic temperatures increase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the  Mediterranean, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/Medterranean-bluefin-action040610/"&gt;our  activists on board the Rainbow Warrior and the Arctic Sunrise have been  defending the endangered Northern bluefin tuna&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/with-iccat-in-the-driving-seat-what-hope-is-t/blog/11983"&gt;failure  of governments and management organsations&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/bluefin-an-endangered-icon/blog/11837"&gt;this  key species&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year. We're calling for the closure of  this fishery in the Meditereanean and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/Save-the-bluefin-tuna-of-the-Mediterranean-/"&gt;the  creation of a marine reserve surrounding the Balearic islands&lt;/a&gt; -  protecting one of the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/bluefins-mediterranean-holiday-romance-will-i/blog/11815"&gt;bluefin's  most important spawning grounds in the Med&lt;/a&gt;. This area is even more  crucial now that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is threatening the  bluefin spawning grounds there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On World Oceans Day this year -  defending our oceans seems harder than ever as the threats to marine  life and to our activists become more serious. But rather than be  discouraged - we're intensifying our efforts and we're asking our  supporters to do the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/End-whaling-NOW/"&gt;TAKE  ACTION!

	In a world in which the sole superpower refuses to accept or address climate change as the single largest risk facing our planet's future, Russia needs to fill the environmental leadership gap.  Yet President Putin missed an opportunity yesterday at the UN World Climate Change Conference to announce ratification of the Kyoto Protocol limiting greenhouse gasses.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Banner  in Russian and English demands Putin ratify Kyoto Treaty
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1997 Kyoto Protocol would bind countries to a 5.5 percent
reduction in their 1990 levels of greenhouse-gas emissions by
2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"President Putin has had more than three years to analyse how
Kyoto could be implemented in Russia, and his stalling could now
derail the entire process," said Steven Guilbeault, one of our
climate campaigners now in Moscow. "Russia can play a leading role
in helping solve the problem of climate change or it can choose to
side with George Bush."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Bush Administration decided to pull out of the
agreement in 2001, only with Russian ratification can the 1997
Protocol enter into force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 2002 Earth Summit, Russian Prime Minister Kasyanov
said that Russia would ratify "soon", a commitment that was later
confirmed by President Putin. However, since then, the Russian
ratification process has been mired in the intricacies of Russian
politics with anti-Kyoto forces like Economic Development and Trade
Minister Gref having a field day in the face of Putin's hesitation
to ratify the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All is ready for Russian ratification," Guilbeault added. "An
additional amendment for the Russian legislation process has
already been agreed this September by an inter-ministerial group
headed by Vice-Prime Minister Khrastenko. Everything is in
President Putin's hands. He has a political, economic and
environmental responsibility not just to Russia, but to the world,"
he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take effect, the protocol must be ratified by no fewer than
55 countries, accounting for at least 55 percent of global
emissions in 1990. Current signatories account for only 44.2
percent of emissions, and only Russian ratification can now make
the treaty binding if the US refuses to do so. The US accounts for
one third of the 1990 emission benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, 119 States have ratified, accepted, or acceded to
Kyoto. Of the 37 industrialized countries who agreed emissions
targets under Kyoto, only 5 have not yet ratified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monaco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon-Mobil, the world's largest oil company and a major
contributor to George Bush's election campaign, has been a major
lobbying force against Kyoto ratification in the US. A memo
uncovered by Greenpeace recently suggests that the White House may
have used an Exxon front group in an attempt to suppress an EPA
study that recognised climate change as having human causes. (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/news/details?item_id=308563"&gt;
You can read the full story here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), may have
sued the Environmental Protection Agency over the study at the
bidding of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Two
States Attorney Generals are demanding an investigation into the
links between the White House and the Exxon-funded CEI.&lt;/p&gt;

            Minke whale steaks barbecued in peaceful protest against Greenpeace in Iceland
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polls have shown up to 80% of the Icelandic population in favour
of whaling before the arrival of the Greenpeace ship on Thursday
last week. But Greenpeace surprised many by not rushing directly
out to confront whaling ships, and instead choosing to dialogue,
and to make an offer to the government to promote nature tourism as
an alternative to whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, an Icelandic State Radio and Television poll
asking if the government should accept that offer yielded an
encouraging majority "yes" response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland has been an increasingly popular tourist magnet, and a
burgeoning Whale watching industry has taken hold. More than
277,000 people visited Iceland in 2001. That's almost more than the
entire population of the island. It's estimated that in that year,
one third of those visitors went whale-watching. According to &lt;a href="http://www.enn.com/news/2003-06-05/s_4794.asp"&gt;ENN&lt;/a&gt;, a
dozen firms have sprung up in Iceland over the past decade,
generating around US$8.5 million in revenue in 2001. Commercial
whaling brought in US$3 million to US$4 million annually between
1986 and 1989, when commercial hunts were stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Iceland isn't welcoming Greenpeace with open arms quite yet.
"Once we had eggs thrown at us, and when they ran out of eggs, they
threw red peppers" said Erika Augustinsson. "Then on Friday we had
some boys arranging a whale meat barbecue at the quay side in
Reykjavik, just in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday evening they showed up with a portable barbecue, the next
day they turned up with a bigger barbecue. So Frode, our whale
campaigner, walked up and invited everyone onboard and was met with
a suspicious gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hour later all of the boys asked if they could join the ship
to sail around Iceland. So we are making some new friends on our
path."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/iceland"&gt;&lt;img src="http://dynamic.greenpeace.org/IcelandPics/RWtourbutton.gif" border="0" align="left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior will make a call in the port of Isafjordur
on the North side of the island shortly, continuing in its efforts
to listen to the people of Iceland, and to explain why we believe
the government should give up whaling forever. "It's important that
we talk to people one to one, to get them beyond the perception
that some have of us as terrorists, or culturally naive, or
anti-Icelandic. We're none of those things. We've never used
violence, we've never rammed or sunk a whaling ship. We ourselves
are from many cultures, and have learned to work out our
differences with respect. And when it comes to hating Iceland,
Iceland is actually a model nation environmentally in many
respects, and a strong ally to Greenpeace internationally on
several issues -- from ocean pollution to fisheries management to
climate change -- that whaling needs to be seen as the anomaly it
is" said Frode Pleym, a Norwegian whale activist aboard the ship.
"We think Iceland will benefit more from positioning themselves as
the "Land of the Whale" and bringing tourists over to watch living
whales, rather than hunting them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13,000 activists so far have also &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=915&amp;amp;s=whl"&gt;written to
Iceland's ambassadors&lt;/a&gt; to the US, Germany, and the UK asking
them to reconsider. An appeal to cyberactivists and supporters
asking them to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=959&amp;amp;sk=std3&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;
express an interest in visiting Iceland&lt;/a&gt; if the government stops
whaling has been generating nearly 1000 responses a day. We intend
to keep the Icelandic tourist industry, which opposes whaling,
apprised of the number of would-be tourists which want to visit
their shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The High North Alliance, a pro-whaling lobby group which has
been an outspoken critic of Greenpeace described the offer as
"Mafia Tactics" in a &lt;a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08655067.htm"&gt;Reuter's
report&lt;/a&gt;. "Balderdash" said Erika Augustinsson, "I think most
Icelanders appreciate our right to express our view and seek to
convince others, even when they disagree. We generally find that
when people have all the facts, they make the right choice. That's
not Mafia tactics, it's democracy."&lt;/p&gt;

	Our presence in Iceland is starting to turn the tide of opinion on this North Atlantic Island. The Icelandic Government is now reviewing the so-called "scientific whaling" programme and the Prime Minister recently indicated that if no export markets can be secured in future, this will mean an end to Icelandic whaling.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, key players are asking the Government to act on our
offer to encourage Iceland as a nature-based tourism destination in
the future, once whaling has come to an end. The Icelandic national
TV and radio ran a web poll asking people if they think the
Icelandic Government should accept Greenpeace's offer. By the end
of the polling period a total of 71 percent had voted said "yes,"
the Government should accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On board the Rainbow Warrior, our spokesperson Frode Pleym
welcomed the development: "The Icelandic people, particularly the
younger generation, are obviously starting to question their
government's whale hunting agenda. We know that Greenpeace will not
change opinion in a week, but this is a promising start."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainbow Warrior has now reached Seydisfjördur in the north of
Iceland, on its tour of the country. The purpose of the tour is to
engage in a dialogue with the public on the whaling issue, and to
support local opposition to the plan. The crew have been encouraged
by the reaction so far, as support for the government seems to be
falling in the towns which Rainbow Warrior has visited to expose
the fallacy of "scientific whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Husavik is one such example: "The Greenpeace
proposal is good for the Icelandic people, for tourism and for the
environment," says Fridrik Sigurdsson, Chairman of the Husavik
Marketing Council. "I want to send a short message to the
government: Stop whaling and don't start again. Whale watching is
extremely important to us but it is impossible to expand when we do
such a wrong thing as whale hunting. For us in Husavik it could be
a disaster."&lt;/p&gt;

Greenpeace photographer Nick Cobbing has been bearing witness to
the current activities of the Icelandic whaling fleet, flying over
in a light aircraft to photograph the flensing (or skinning) of one
of the 38 minke whales caught under the "scientific whaling"
programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time for the Icelandic Government to start listening to the
ever-increasing number of its own people and others all over the
world who say that these practices belong to the past, and have no
place in the future of what, in many ways, is one of the most
ecologically advanced nations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Kyodo news interview on 10 September Icelandic Prime
Minister David Oddsson admitted that a resumption of commercial
whaling would be dependent on the Japanese export market, because
demand at home was "very, very small."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Frode Pleym this admission means that "The
Icelandic Government may just as well cancel all plans for whaling,
since there will never be any export to Japan. International
reactions and, ironically, toxic contamination of whale meat would
stop that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) bans trade in minke whale meat products, and while Japan,
Iceland, and Norway hold a reservation which they claim exempts
them from the ban, strong international pressure has been brought
in the past to enforce CITES regulations. High levels of
contamination from North Sea pollutants have led to warnings from
Japanese consumer groups that whale meat captured in arctic waters
is unfit for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior made her maiden voyage to Iceland in 1978.
Many of the countries that were then whaling nations are today the
staunchest opponents of commercial whaling. They now accept that
the oceans are severely degraded and that whales face a complex
array of environmental threats including those posed by toxic
chemicals, climate change and even noise pollution. In such
circumstances it would be folly to restart whaling, especially when
there is a truly sustainable alternative: whale watching.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Iceland has announced it will recommence whaling in 2003.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior will embark on a tour round the North
Atlantic island to engage in dialogue with the people of Iceland,
and to support existing local opposition from communities reliant
on the tourism generated by whale watching. We are asking
cyberactivists everywhere to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=915&amp;amp;s=whl"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;
the government and &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/col/get?i=959&amp;amp;sk=is&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;to
pledge their willingness to spend vacation time in Iceland if
whaling is not recommenced,&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ecs/s2?i=960&amp;amp;sk=std&amp;amp;la=en"&gt;invite
their friends along with an e-card.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to let Iceland's leaders know the strength of
international feeling on this issue. If international reaction is
short lived the government will proceed with its plan, paving the
way for a resumption of full scale commercial whaling for export in
2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a press conference onboard the Rainbow Warrior spokesperson
Frode Pleym made an offer to the Icelandic government:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace will be the link between people around the world and
the people of Iceland who want to protect this island's natural
resources. We will encourage our supporters and the general public
to actively choose Iceland and nature based tourism in the future.
We offer to work with the people of Iceland towards a
future-oriented ecological society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return Greenpeace is urging the Icelandic Government to stop
the current whale hunt of 38 minke whales; publicly agree that so
called "scientific whaling" will not be resumed under any guise;
and withdraw Iceland's reservation to the international ban on
commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pleym made the point that "The Icelandic Government's attempt to
justify whaling 'on scientific grounds' is economic suicide. Whale
watching is now the heart of an even larger nature tourism industry
that is exceeded in economic importance only by Iceland's fish
based industries. Already we see tourists cancelling trips to
Iceland due to the whale hunt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages to Iceland of developing a whale meat and blubber
industry remain unclear: the domestic market is very small and the
only potential export market is Japan, where the issue remains
highly controversial. Iceland's growing whale watching industry is
already far more lucrative than whaling could ever become and a
responsible government should be doing all it can to protect all
cetaceans in its seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are no legitimate reasons for the Icelandic Government to
hunt whales." said Frode Pleym. "The argument that it is necessary
to control the minke whale population to safeguard cod stocks is
pseudo science, and used by the Government simply to influence
public opinion. They're holding their people hostage to an
unsustainable tradition. Whaling is part of Iceland's past and
Iceland's future can only be undermined by a renewed whale
hunt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior first sailed against Icelandic whaling on
her maiden voyage in 1978 when the world's largest mammals were on
the verge of extinction. Today seven of the 13 great whale species
are endangered, the remainder are still recovering from former
overexploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	There's an old joke that you can walk into any bar in Vancouver and find somebody claiming to be a Greenpeace founder. If that somebody had been Jim Bohlen, however, then this claim would have been absolutely true. It is with very deep sadness, then, that we have learned of Jim's death on 5 July, 2010, at the age of 84.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in New York City in 1926, Jim trained as a US naval radio operator. After US navy service, he obtained an engineering degree and took a job with a defence contractor on Long Island, where he met famed engineer R. Buckminster Fuller. Jim moved to Vancouver in the late 1960s when his second wife Marie’s son became eligible for the military draft; as Quakers, they were strongly opposed to US involvement in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Saturday morning in the spring of 1968, the Bohlens attended an anti-war demonstration on the lawn of the Provincial Court House. Knowing almost nobody there, they looked for fellow Quakers among the maze of protestors, and introduced themselves to Irving and Dorothy Stowe. The four soon became devoted friends, and were charter members of a new British Columbia chapter of the Sierra Club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the US began testing nuclear weapons at Amchitka Island, Alaska. The "Cannikin" test was scheduled for September 1971. Although some in the Sierra Club got cold feet about campaigning against the tests, Jim, Irving and law student Paul Cote formed the "Don’t Make a Wave Committee" in November 1969. The Committee met at the Stowes’ house to plan their protest against the Amchitka test, but the consensus process of the committee could often result in long debates and slow resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim was explaining his frustrations with this slow process to Marie one morning, when she casually asked why they didn’t simply sail a boat there. At the same time, they received a telephone call from the Vancouver Sun, asking what campaigns they might be planning. Caught off-guard, Jim said, "We hope to sail a boat to Amchitka to confront the bomb." The newspaper ran the story the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Marie's idea and Jim's "announcement" had bypassed the consensus process, nobody opposed the plan. The Committee unanimously ratified the action, although at that time they had neither a boat nor the money to charter one. Stowe organised &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/amchitka-the-1970s-rock-concert-that-launched/blog/10432"&gt;a concert – which would feature Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Phil Ochs and Chilliwac&lt;/a&gt;k – to raise funds for a boat; Bohlen, in the meantime, stumbled across one Captain John C. Cormack, skipper of the halibut seiner Phyllis Cormack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim's naval experience was one of the many reasons he was a leader aboard the Phyllis Cormack when it sailed towards Amchitka, ahead of the testing. In a protest inspired by the Quaker movements practice of 'bearing witness' the political furore caused by the group – which had now renamed itself Greenpeace – caused the test to be delayed. The US would ultimately abandon its programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim continued to work with Greenpeace for several years, leaving when the organisation shifted its campaign focus to other issues. When the 1980s saw a resurgence of Greenpeace campaigning against nuclear weapons he was involved once again, leading direct actions against cruise missile testing and participating in the Nuclear Free Seas campaign against nuclear weapons being brought into port cities aboard the warships of nuclear navies. Jim retired to his home on Denman Island in 1987. A passionate 'green' and 'peacenik,' he continued to advocate renewable energy and agitate against nuclear power and nuclear weapons as a Green Party activist, standing as a candidate in the federal election of 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim is survived by his wife Marie, a stepson, a son and daughter by his first wife Anna, and a global environmental organisation. The simple but serendipitous enthusiasm of Jim and Marie on the morning they told the Vancouver Sun they would be taking a boat to Amchitka was, arguably, the moment that Greenpeace was born.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today, after a ten year Greenpeace campaign, Europe banned the trade in illegal timber - a great leap forward in the struggle to protect the world's forests and climate. This is a look back at the ten years of activism that led to that law. It's about how we – and you – challenged governments to live up to their responsibilities to safeguard our planet, and won. It's also a reminder that, while our friends in Japan face jail for opposing environmental crimes, history suggests they will one day be seen as law-makers, not law-breakers. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This story starts a long time back, but we'll pick it up ten years ago, when Greenpeace began a campaign to stop Europe’s trade in illegal timber. (It sounds odd - it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; odd - but, until now, illegally logged timber could still be legally imported and traded in European markets.)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Since 2000, Greenpeace has been campaigning to end illegal logging in ancient forests in the Amazon, Central Africa, Russia and South-East Asia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that illegal logging contributed to &lt;a title="Deforestation and climate change" href="~/link/f92afa5650e1435b98a6b981ea8a6ed5.aspx"&gt;deforestation and climate change&lt;/a&gt;. We knew it threatened species with extinction. We knew it was often blood timber - linked to organised crime and to violent civil wars. We also knew that illegal timber came mainly from countries with weak governance, where corporate criminals could cause enormous environmental damage with little consequence to themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next decade, scores of Greenpeace activists put their lives and liberty on the line to expose and stop &lt;a title="Illegal logging" href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/threats/illegal-logging/"&gt;illegal logging&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon, Africa, Russia, and Southeast Asia – by blockading ports, halting wood shipments and going undercover to investigate criminal logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A landmark law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, trading illegal timber hasn't actually been illegal in Europe. While this law isn't perfect (all timber products are covered except printed materials like books, which will be exempt for at least five years), it's a good start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes into force, the law will ban illegal timber from entering Europe. European timber traders and forest owners who put timber and timber products on the EU market will have to verify the legality of any products suspected of being illegal, and offenders could be fined. Furthermore, traceability requirements mean that timber in products can be traced from a shop back to the country of harvest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If properly enforced, the law will strengthen forest protection, force the timber sector to be more transparent and drive the systemic changes desperately needed to end illegal logging once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The power of activism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Greenpeace's history, non-violent direct action has helped us to win campaigns like this one. With political leaders globally lacking the will to take responsibility and safeguard our planet, a lot of laws would never have made the statute books if activists hadn't got out there to expose and confront environmental crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hard won victory was one that was desperately needed; in the ten years since we launched our campaign, the world has &lt;a title="UN Food and Agriculture Organization" href="http://foris.fao.org/static/data/fra2010/KeyFindings-en.pdf"&gt;lost over 40 million hectares of its forests (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; – that's an area the size of Germany and Denmark put together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next ten years, the challenge is even bigger. To tackle climate change, we need to &lt;a title="Call for zero deforestation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-climate-bomb-is-ticking/"&gt;end deforestation&lt;/a&gt; by 2020: all deforestation - illegal or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Europe is strengthening its forest laws today, yesterday Brazil voted in favour of weakening the Forest Code, legislation that helps protect the Amazon. If the proposed new code becomes law, it will give a green light for further forest destruction and an amnesty to those who have violated the law by illegally destroying the rainforest in recent decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're working on it, and we'll certainly need your help. Today though, there's time to take a couple of minutes out to celebrate, and feel the forest love:&lt;/p&gt;

	"One of the principles of Greenpeace, one of the things that makes us so strong and special, is that we are non-violent. Fernando did not have to die; he was a threat to no one. We will never forget him. I hope the generations of activists who sail on the new ship will be as determined and as exceptional and as inspired as he was," said Rainbow Warrior Captain Pete Willcox, as he laid a wreath today for Fernando Pereira, the Greenpeace photographer, who was murdered when French agents bombed and sunk the Rainbow Warrior 25 years ago.

&lt;p&gt;Willcox was the skipper on &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-war/"&gt;the night the Warrior was bombed&lt;/a&gt;, he continues to sail with Greenpeace, and is in Gdansk, Poland, to witness the laying of the keel for a new Rainbow Warrior. A purpose built sailing vessel to replace the current, and second Warrior, to continue her mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-war/rainbow/Death-of-a-Rainbow-Warrior/"&gt;Fernando&lt;/a&gt; was the father of two young children, and had just turned 35. He lost his life that night because a government chose to respond to nonviolent protesters with deadly force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of French secret agents were dispatched to New Zealand to "neutralize" the Rainbow Warrior, from where the ship was sailing to Moruroa Atoll, to peacefully oppose French nuclear testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explosion heard coming from the harbour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bomb exploded at 11.38pm, lifting those in the mess off their seats. Chief Engineer Davy Edwards rushed into the ship's engine room to find a hole the size of a car, water pouring in. A second bomb went off shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Naming the bombers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-war/rainbow/"&gt;secret agents implicated in his killing&lt;/a&gt;, Only two served any time in prison, and then less than three years, before returning from their bombing mission to France. The total list of agents is still unknown, but they include: Dr. Xavier Maniguet, Chief Petty Officer Roland Verge, (alias Raymond Velche), Petty Officer Bartelo (alias Jean-Michel Berthelot), Petty Officer Gerald Andries (aliases Eric Audrenc, Eric Andreine), Major Alain Mafart (alias Alain Turenge), and Captain Dominique Prieur (alias Sophie Turenge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The struggle of man against power", wrote Milan Kundera, "is the struggle of memory against forgetting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the bombers were not a rogue terrorist outfit - they were acting under orders from Paris. While their spying and bombing careers may be behind them now, nine states continue to threaten humanity with the spectre of a nuclear holocaust. They are the United States, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You can't sink a rainbow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the original Rainbow Warrior was bombed the threat of nuclear war represented our worst nightmare, and concern over climate change was just beginning. Now, it is well understood that hundreds of thousands of people are already dying as a result of the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/ships/the-rainbow-warrior/"&gt;The new Rainbow Warrior&lt;/a&gt; will play a vital role in Greenpeace's campaign for action to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first Rainbow Warrior set sail in 1978 the ship has been an icon of non-violent direct action and a beacon of hope for millions of people around the world. The Rainbow Warrior has been on the frontline, bearing witness to and challenging environmental abuses. More than ever the world needs hope, it needs action, it needs a Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Ben's account of the end of the action" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/update-greenpeace-activists-arrested/blog/26338"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; about why our climbers decided to come down and what we have accomplished during the two-day occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists climbed the oil rig to demand that Cairn Energy &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/Help-us-stop-dangerous-oil-drilling-in-the-Arctic/"&gt;end its dangerous drilling&lt;/a&gt; in the Arctic and for the world to go beyond oil towards a safer more sustainable future. For nine days the Esperanza was shadowed by a Danish warship, commandos in speed boats and a flotilla of police boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cairn is also operating a drilling ship in the area of Baffin Bay, the Stena Forth, which also had to be shut down during the Stena Don occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil drilling rigs are operating in an area known locally as ‘iceberg  alley’. Cairn Energy regularly has to tow icebergs out of the rigs  paths or uses water cannons to divert them. If the icebergs are too large  then the company will have to move the rig itself to avoid a collision.  Last month, a 260 square kilometer ice island broke off the Petermann glacier north  of Disko island and will eventually make its way south through Nares  Strait into Baffin Bay and the Labrador Current making these dangerous  operations a reality once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Cairn Energy claimed it had struck gas and was optimistic it would strike oil. By stopping it drilling for two days, Cairn Energy might now struggle to meet a tight deadline to complete the exploration before winter ice conditions force it to abandon the search for oil off Greenland until next year. We’d hoped to stay longer, we’d hoped to extend the shut down to run Cairn out of time to finish its exploration programme before the harsh winter weather forces them out of the region until next year. A year is a long time: enough time, we hope, to get a global ban on deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ending the protest one of the climbers, Sim McKenna from the United States, said via satellite phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We stopped this rig drilling for oil for two days, but in the end the Arctic weather beat us. Last night was freezing and now the sea below us is churning and the wind is roaring. It’s time to come down, but we’re proud we slowed the mad rush for Arctic oil, if only for a couple of days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baffin Bay is home to 80 to 90 percent of the world’s Narwhal whales.  The region is also home to blue whales, polar bears, seals, sharks, cormorants, kittiwakes and numerous other migratory birds.  Don’t let Cairn Energy continue to gamble with dangerous drilling in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Oil spill in China worsens</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Oil-spill-in-China-worsens/</url><text>
	We continue to keep a close watch on the development of the oil spill in Dalian, China, which has already cost the life of a firemen and continues to grow, posing an increasingly severe threat to the area’s coastal ecosystem.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/98854/Dalian%20Oil%20Spill/GP024RM_layout.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang Liang, a 25-year-old who was with the Dalian Fire Department, died as he was trying to fix an underwater pump, which was heavily clogged by petroleum and debris. Greenpeace China yesterday &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/news/dalian-oil-spill"&gt;sent a letter to the fire department expressing sympathy and respect&lt;/a&gt; for the fireman and those on the front lines of the clean-up effort in Dalian, Liaoning province, China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our planet’s over-reliance on petroleum caused this tragedy,” Greenpeace Climate Campaign Manager Ailun Yang said. “It is a sad day for those involved in the clean-up effort, and for the planet as whole. Ultimately it is we human beings who pay the price for our oil addiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="565" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/bN1n3pOxYCg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/98854/Dalian%20Oil%20Spill/GP024NN_layout.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace team was on the scene when a sudden strong wave swept Zhang Liang away. While his fellow workers attempted to rescue him, the heavy oil choking the water – some twenty centimeters thick at an eyeballed estimate – made any rescue effort nearly impossible. The second firefighter was eventually pulled from the ocean alive, but Zhang was not found until hours too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we sent a second series of photographs to international media that document the extent of the oil spill first-hand. A first series of images, including scenes from the attempted rescue operation, already provided arresting evidence of what is happening in Dalian – just days after BP finally capped its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the US, it took several days for the true extent of the spill to become apparent – amid official underestimations of the size of the spill, predictions of a rapid cleanup, and promises of minimum environmental damage. As the spill continued to spread unchecked and graphic evidence such as our images surfaced, those assurances vaporized into, at best, the oily rainbows of wishful thinking or, at worst, the heavy sludge of deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still too early to fully evaluate the environmental consequences of the accident. On Wednesday, beaches on the Yellow Sea had to be closed amid fears that the sticky black crude could become a severe threat to the coastal ecosystem, as well as the fishing and tourism industries and local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/98854/GP024RL_layout.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain, however: there is no such thing as a complete clean-up. The damage done by every oil spill is irreversible and long-lasting. Greenpeace calls for a revolution of our energy system, through improving energy efficiency as well as developing renewable energy resources. At the same time, we must move away from dirty fossil fuels such as oil and coal for a clean, sustainable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill in Dalian happened after two pipelines exploded on July 16, spilling oil into the Bohai Gulf. The pipelines were transferring oil from a Liberian tanker ship to storage facilities in Dalian’s Xingang Port. One pipe exploded, triggering a series of explosions in another pipeline and breaking open a storage tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 11,000 barrels (1,500 tons) of crude leaked into the ocean, creating an oil slick that has expanded over some 100 square kilometers. A fire raged for 15 hours before it was mostly extinguished. The clean up process is taking place with booms, skimmers, and dispersants, which themselves are hazardous chemicals whose harmful effects have not yet been fully studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times will local communities have to relive this nightmare? &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/ER-pledge/"&gt;It's time for an Energy [R]evolution and an end to the era of dirty, deadly fuels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>'Inception' Star Marion Cotillard's other new film</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/marion-cotillard-congo220710/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;'The Congolese Rainforests: living on borrowed time'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Oscar-winning French actress, Marion Cotillard, has long been a supporter of the environment - and of Greenpeace. Last month, she travelled with us to the heart of the Congo rainforests to bear witness to the plundering of this ancient forest. Now you can follow Marion’s journey in a series of video travelogues – a powerful testimony to the Congo’s forests, and to the struggle to prevent their destruction. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="/international/Global/africa/image/2010/forests/marion-cotillard.jpg" alt="Marion Cotillard" width="200"&gt;International logging companies are plundering &lt;a title="DRC forests campaign" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-africa/campaigns/Forests-hub/"&gt;the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; (DRC) and causing social chaos for many of the 40 million-odd people who depend on the rainforests for their livelihoods but whose voices are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the logging companies trade (often illegally logged) timber, avoid taxes, bribe officials and cheat local people out of invaluable forest resources in exchange for a few bags of salt, the forests themselves – and the many endangered species that live in them – are &lt;a title="DRC forests - the problem" href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/africa/problem/"&gt;in jeopardy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, French actress Marion Cotillard took an amazing journey through these threatened rainforests and met the protagonists of this unhappy story. Travelling by &lt;em&gt;pirogue&lt;/em&gt; (a small wooden boat), she witnessed the destruction caused by logging first hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've seen how large-scale timber operations are threatening [some of] the planet’s last intact forests," said Marion. "They’re being eaten away from the inside. This extraordinary ecosystem that supports the lives of tens of millions of people and is the planet’s second largest green lung is in danger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At each meeting, during each discussion with the people living there, I could see the looting that’s unfolding in these remote lands: the industrial loggers arrive, hand out a few ‘crumbs’ and then cut down the most valuable wood. This wood is often exported to the European market where it’s sold at exorbitant prices - while in the Congolese forests, workers risk their lives and are often paid less than a dollar a day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A video travelogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We filmed Marion’s journey and, over the next few weeks, you will be able to travel with her through some of the planet’s last intact forests. Four episodes of the film are already available - with three more episodes to be released over the coming weeks. They will be available exclusively online - follow Greenpeace on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.international"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/greenpeace"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/greenpeacevideo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to be alerted of the next episode's release. Especially stay tuned for the next episode of Marion's travelogue - where she first hears about the social conflict caused by industrial logging companies like Sodefor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only viable solution would be for rich countries to financially help the Congolese to protect their forests. It’s in the interests of all of humanity to preserve this treasure: to save what’s left of biodiversity, to fight against climate change, and to ensure the Democratic Republic of Congo sees genuine development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            Approximately 40 million people in the DRC depend on the rainforest for their basic needs, such as medicine, food or shelter. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;The Congo Basin forest is the second largest rainforest on Earth and it &lt;a title="Deforestation and climate change" href="~/link/f92afa5650e1435b98a6b981ea8a6ed5.aspx"&gt;plays a vital role&lt;/a&gt; in controlling &lt;a title="Climate change campaign" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-africa/campaigns/Climate-change/"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. The DRC has the fourth largest national store of forest carbon in the world - its forests store as much as 8% of the Earth's carbon contained in living forests. Unless plans to expand industrial logging are scrapped, these forests are in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DRC is at risk of losing over 40% of its forests by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for a halt to the expansion of industrial logging in the DRC, especially in intact forests. The 2002 moratorium on allocation or extension of industrial logging permits must be maintained and enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is urgent that donors and the DRC Government shifts its support away from destructive logging and towards plans that will increase intact forests and climate protection as well as environmentally responsible and socially equitable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supports an international forest protection fund that will allow rainforests countries to keep their forests alive, protect livelihoods and biodiversity, and help to save the climate. We’re campaigning for zero deforestation in the world's intact tropical forests by 2020 - and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-climate-bomb-is-ticking/"&gt;an end to &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;deforestation, everywhere, by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marion will be featured on the cover of Interview magazine in August - inside she talks of her recent trip to the Congo rainforest with Greenpece and of her interest in the environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first days of my trip the problem seemed really dark. But when I  started talking to people, I realized that there was some hope—they want  to get their power back.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That made me feel like there  was hope to make things right. Hopefully I, along with the people at  Greenpeace, can be a witness to what is happening over there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Read an excerpt of Marion's interview &lt;a href="http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/marion-cotillard/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Update July 30, 2010:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Episodes 5 &amp;amp; 6 of her travelogue Marion speaks with local people about the relationship between them and industrial logging companies - who may compensate villagers with things like salt, soap and beer in exchange for years of logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows that any expansion of the Congo’s logging industry will  only exacerbate both social conflict and environmental destruction. Yet,  despite this the government seems set on increasing logging in the near  future. A recent Greenpeace report '&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Forest-reform-in-the-Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo-Leaving-people-out/"&gt;Forest reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;' outlines the need for sustainable development that is environmentally  responsible and socially equitable in the DRC. Industrial logging is not the  answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this morning, our climbers left the Esperanza and headed out into the misty Arctic waters of Baffin Bay, off Greenland, and headed straight for the drilling rig, which is being operated by a British company Cairn Energy. They had to outrun Danish Navy commandos before climbing up the inside of the rig and hanging from it in tents suspended from ropes. They have enough supplies to stay in their hanging tents for several days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they are able to halt the drilling for just a short time, Cairn Energy will struggle to meet a tight deadline to complete its exploration before winter ice conditions force it to abandon the search for oil off Greenland until next year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Esperanza, has been anchored between the Stena Don rig and Stena Forth drill ship, which are 20 miles apart, for nine days now. A Danish Thetis-class warship has stayed in close vicinity throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fragile environment west of Disko Island is known as Iceberg Alley due to the plentiful icebergs and tough conditions. This has deterred oil companies from attempting exploration there in recent years, but the world’s oil giants are watching the Cairn project with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Cairn is successful the Arctic could be flooded with oil companies, all trying to operate in hazardous polar conditions. Analysts are expecting a whole new Arctic oil rush, with Exxon, Chevron and other energy giants already buying up licenses to drill in the area. The implications for the area, which has populations of blue whales, polar bears, seals and migratory birds, could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this has to happen. We have the great chance to go beyond oil by launching an Energy Revolution, ending fossil fuel subsidies, increasing the support for clean energy and launching strong laws and policies that limit global warming pollution – all that is needed is the political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Anne Rabinowitz was born in Providence, Rhode Island on December 22, 1920, from Jewish immigrant parents from Russia and Galicia. She described her father Jacob as “idealistic and political. He cared about justice not only for Jewish people, but for everyone.” Dorothy's mother, Rebecca Miller, taught Hebrew and inspired Dorothy to pursue an education.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dorothy attended Pembroke College in the U.S., majored in English and philosophy, became a psychiatric social worker, and served as the first president of her local civic employees union. During the repressive McCarthy era, when she threated a strike, the state governor erroneously called her a “communist,” but she stood her ground and won a pay raise for her union.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1953 Dorothy married civil rights lawyer Irving Strasmich. They celebrated their wedding dinner at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the organization that launched the U.S. civil rights movement.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;They changed their family name to Stowe in honour of Harriet Beecher Stowe – pioneering feminist and abolitionist, who helped end slavery in the U.S. The Stowes had two children, Robert, born in 1955 and Barbara in 1956, both now living in Vancouver.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the 1950s, Dorothy and Irving Stowe began campaigning against nuclear weapons, adopting the Quaker ideas of “bearing witness” to wrong-doing and “speaking truth to power.” The Quaker boats, Golden Rule and Phoenix in 1958 influenced the Stowes' decision twelve years later to sail a boat to Amchitka Island nuclear test zone in Alaska, the first Greenpeace campaign.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1961, to avoid supporting the Vietnam War with their taxes, Dorothy and Irving immigrated to New Zealand, where they led demonstrations at the U.S. embassy and protested French nuclear weapons tests in Polynesia. However, when New Zealand sent troops to Vietnam in 1965, the Stowes moved their family to Canada.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In Vancouver, Dorothy worked as a family therapist, supporting Irving's full time peace activism. The Stowes met journalists Bob Hunter and Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, who helped promote their campaigns. At a peace rally, they met fellow Quakers Jim and Marie Bohlen and Hunter's British wife Zoe. This group formed the core of a new peace and ecology organization that would rock the world with dramatic protests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the U.S. announced a series of nuclear tests in Alaska in 1968, the Stowes formed the “Don't Make a Wave Committee,” a name inspired by the fear of a tsunami caused by the blasts. Dorothy Stowe recruited social workers and women's groups to organize a boycott of US products until the nuclear tests were cancelled. When Jim and Marie Bohlen suggested sailing a boat into the test zone, Dorothy and Irving Stowe agreed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;They chartered the halibut boat, the Phyllis Cormack, renamed “Greenpeace” to emphasize the merging of peace and ecology. The boat set sail in Septermber 1971, was arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard, and never reached the island. Nevertheless, the voyage created a public uprising, and in February 1972, the U.S. announced an end to the nuclear tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In May, 1972, the group changed its name to “Greenpeace.” Today, the organization has offices in over forty countries including China and India, and most recently in Africa. “It is amazing,” Dorothy recalled, “what a few people sitting around their kitchen table can achieve.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the years since, Dorothy has hosted hundreds of of young activists, who made the pilgrimage to her home for inspiration. When the band U2 visited Vancouver in 2005, singer Bono made a special effort to meet Dorothy Stowe. Dorothy never rested on past success or stopped working for social change. Her life-long dedication has inspired activists around the world.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A month before she passed away, Dorothy hosted a brunch for new Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo. Kumi mentioned later that the meeting was one of the most inspiring moments of his life, witnessing the optimism and enthusiasm of a woman who had dedicated her life to making the world a better place for others.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The most fitting memorial for Dorothy Stowe is that we all get up each morning and go back to work in the service of peace, justice, and the living Earth.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rex Weyler&lt;br&gt;July 23, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Unjust sentence for Japanese anti-whaling activists</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Unjust-sentence-for-Tokyo-Two/</url><text>
	Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, known as the Tokyo Two, exposed widespread corruption in Japan's whaling programme – in return, they have been handed a one year suspended prison sentence. However, despite the harsh punishment the two anti-whaling activists stood in court as heroes today, having successfully put whaling on trial, both in court, and in Japan's national media.

            Gathered today for the Tokyo Two trial verdict in Aomori, Japan.

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the verdict Junichi said, "While the court acknowledged that there were questionable practices in the whaling industry, it did not recognise the right to expose these, as is guaranteed under international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on which our defence was based, supersedes domestic criminal law, but the judgment did not properly take this into account." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This sentence is totally disproportionate and completely undeserved," added Toru. "We set out to reveal the truth about the government's whaling programme, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is appealing this totally unjust, politically motivated sentence. Junichi and Toru have taken great personal risks to investigate and expose embezzlement at the heart of Japan's tax-funded whaling industry. They intercepted one of numerous boxes of whale meat embezzled from the whaling programme as evidence. These boxes were taken for private use by the crew of the Nisshin Maru in violation of the whaling programme's regulations, and this amounts to a misuse of public funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of investigating and arresting those behind the whale meat embezzlement scandal, Junichi and Toru were detained arbitrarily, forced to live under onerous bail conditions and put on trial. After more than two-years of political prosecution the court has convicted them of "theft" and "trespass", while the criminals behind the whale meat embezzlement walk free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; The freedom to peacefully expose wrongdoing is not only a crucial part of any democracy, it is a right that must be defended. Greenpeace will continue to make this case a global priority until this unjust conviction is &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;overturned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;br&gt;Dr. Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- END QUOTE --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conviction is a slap in the face for those that expose inconvenient truths and the misuse of public funds. It's bad news for the entire political culture in Japan, not least the role of non-governmental organizations in society; there is little doubt that the ruling signifies a major step backwards for the country’s aim of gaining international reliability. More broadly this conviction is part of a disturbing trend of authorities meeting peaceful and civil dissent with harsh and disproportionately severe punishments. Sentences such as the one that has been given to Junichi and Toru today create a chilling effect in society. They narrow the democratic space and discourage people from speaking out, with impacts for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists are always prepared to take responsibility for their actions, and standing up in court for what we believe in is often a result of taking appropriate, peaceful action. However, it is unacceptable for the authorities to ignore human rights and freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has already &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/opinion-of-the-unhrc/"&gt;drawn criticism from the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention&lt;/a&gt; for its treatment of Junichi and Toru, and as Professor Dirk Voorhoof, an international law expert and defence witness in the case, said: "This conviction is very likely to earn Japan more criticism for its failure to respect its obligations under international human rights law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru are not alone in facing this verdict. Vigils are being held at Japanese embassies around the world and hundreds of thousands of people have already signed our petition calling for justice. In addition, the Toyo Two's case has already been taken up by Amnesty International, by Nobel Laureates including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and by celebrities like Bryan Adams and Benicio Del Torro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the Tokyo Two trial a lot has also happened to shift public perceptions in Japan. Industry whistleblowers have continued to speak with Japanese media about corruption and wrongdoing in the whaling industry, interest in the story keeps growing, and in the last fortnight alone articles in major newspapers such as Tokyo Shimbun and Kyodo have closely examined the issue. The headlines include "the trial of whale meat theft exposes horrifying realities" and "Scientific Whaling is diverting to illegal channels after all". Japanese journalists are also not just increasingly interested in what's going on in the tax-funded whaling programme, but in what the Tokyo Two trial has to say on the question of freedom of expression and non-governmental organizations' rights in their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy," said Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr. Kumi Naidoo, who travelled to Japan to hear the verdict. "The freedom to peacefully expose wrongdoing is not only a crucial part of any democracy, it is a right that must be defended. Greenpeace will continue to make this case a global priority until this unjust conviction is overturned."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're standing with Junichi and Toru all the way and will make sure as many people as possible hear their story – and the positive impact their brave action is having.&lt;/p&gt;

	It took eight hours, a powerful tugboat and the specialist division of the water police to end the Rainbow Warrior's blockade of the The Rhein, a ship transporting Genetically Engineered (GE) soya in Port Kembla Harbour. Despite the arrest of the Warrior's captain, our campaign against GE soya didn't slow down.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 11pm, Monday April 26th police boarded the Rainbow Warrior
and arrested its captain, Derek Nicholls of New Zealand. He was
charged with failing to comply with directions by the harbour
master and with entering a pilotage port without taking on a pilot.
He has been bailed to appear in Port Kembla local court in
June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Activists paint message on Inghams HQ." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="59100"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;However,
less than five hours later Greenpeace Australia's activists were
back on the job, branding the office tower of Inghams national
headquarters in western Sydney with the message "YUK GM feed!" next
to the company logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chicken industry is Australia's biggest user of GE soya and
Inghams is the country's leading poultry supplier. Its poultry is
marketed nationally under the Inghams, Woolworths, and Safeway home
brand labels without any mention of the fact that the chickens are
raised on GE feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina Meckel, our GE campaigner in Australia said that Greenpeace
is sending a clear message to Inghams and the rest of the
Australian poultry industry that the company could no longer sneak
GE crops into our food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Survey after survey shows that the vast majority of Australians
are saying a clear 'NO' to genetically engineered foods," said
Meckel. "It's time that Inghams listened to their customers instead
of involving us in a genetic experiment without our knowledge or
consent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Rainbow Warrior in action against GE shipment." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="59061"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Yesterday's
action follows on from last week when our team in Australia painted
the hull of the Rhein in Brisbane with the demand to 'Stop GE
Imports'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Imported soya is the largest source of GE contamination of the
Australian food chain," said John Hepburn, our GE campaign
co-ordinator in Australia. "In Brisbane last week this shipment was
exposed as part of the unlabelled GE trade that sneaks into
Australia each year. Now we are taking action with the Rainbow
Warrior to stop this shipment from travelling to Melbourne to be
unloaded."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The poultry industry is the backbone of the trade in
genetically engineered soya in Australia and Inghams are the single
largest user of GE. We're sending a clear message to them and the
rest of the Australian poultry industry that the public will not
tolerate unlabelled GE in our food."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: "Most Australians would be shocked to know that their
Sunday roast and barbeque chickens have been fed GE. We will
continue to take action around the world to keep GE out of our food
and our fields."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to take action to highlight Inghams use of GE
feed until the company joins the many other Australian food
companies that have responded to environmental and community
concerns by halting the use of GE food and feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Greenpeace in global GE blitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, we have launched global oppostion to GE products by
land, sea, and supermarket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;China:&lt;/span&gt; April 26th,
Seventy-eight food brands announced they are now officially
committed to not selling genetically engineered (GE) food in China
over the week end. These non-GE brands are listed in the Shoppers'
Guide to Avoiding GE Food , which was launched by Greenpeace on
Sunday. The announcement marks increasing market rejection of GE
food in the world's largest food market.&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/ge/archives/001246.html"&gt;Consumer
