	After four years of campaigning to bring an end to deep-sea bottom trawling, an international agreement has been made to protect just under 25 percent of the high seas from this incredibly destructive fishing method.
&lt;div&gt;

            Crewman on the New Zealand bottom trawler dump a large piece of 'Paragorgia' coral dredged from the deep sea in their net. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.southpacificrfmo.org/" target="blank"&gt;countries around the world gathered in Chile&lt;/a&gt; to carve out a fisheries agreement for the South Pacific region. Following a &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/general_assembly/general_assembly_resolutions.htm" target="blank"&gt;resolution made by the UN in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, the countries at the meeting responded strongly with measures to stop destruction of deep water corals, seamounts and other sensitive habitats by vessels that  are bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From September 2007 bottom trawling vessels in the South Pacific will not be able to fish in areas that have or are even likely to have vulnerable marine ecosystems, unless they've completed an assessment to show they won't do any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand fishing industry is responsible for 90 percent of bottom trawling in the region. New Zealand delegates told the meeting these measures would "severely constrain the ability of their fishing industry to continue bottom trawling on the high seas around New Zealand"  and suggested that it may even have the effect of putting an end to bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be watching to make sure that New Zealand - and all the member countries - put the agreement into action, and implement the measures that will protect the irreplaceable biodiversity of deep sea ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mister Splashy Pants the whale - you named him, now save him</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/splashy-101207/</url><text>
	Out of 11,000 submissions in our competition to name the humpback whales we were tracking on their migration to the Southern Ocean, we narrowed it down to the final 30. Over 150,000 people then voted for their favourite name. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mister Splashy Pants is the winner by a nautical mile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/humpback-whales-southern-ocea.jpg" alt="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." width="600" height="395"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the world couldn't get enough of Mister Splashy Pants with many websites encouraging their readers to vote for 'Splashy'. And as we all know, once the wonderful world of the internet got hold of Mister Splashy Pants, it was all over bar the final splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants got a huge 119,367 votes (over 78 percent of the vote) with his nearest rival being Humphrey at 4,329 (less than 3 percent). The rest of the top ten were Aiko, Libertad, Mira, Kaimana, Aurora, Shanti, Amal and Manami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many websites also took credit for the rise and rise of the Splashy-Panted One. Some websites encouraged their readers to cheat and vote more than once, while others like &lt;a href="http://treehugger.com/"&gt;Treehugger&lt;/a&gt; seemed to imply that Mister Splashy Pants wasn't a proper name for a whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sure Treehugger didn't mean it that way but it resulted in a final wave of votes from their readers that took Splashy to an unreachable position at the top of the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who voted for Mister Splashy Pants, now that you've named him, it's time to save him - he might have a great name but he and his friends are still in danger. The only way to be 100 percent sure that 'Splashy' doesn't get harpooned is to stop killing all whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people who voted for a name other than Mister Splashy Pants, take heart. The scientists involved in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt; Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt; tagged 20 humpback whales in the South Pacific. The top 7 names will be used to name whales with a further 5 whales being named by our Whale Defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, a big thanks to YOU, the people who made the name-a-whale competition so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>New leadership at Greenpeace International</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/new-leadership-at-greenpeace-110609/</url><text>
	Greenpeace will soon have a new leader. Kumi Naidoo will take up the role of Executive Director of Greenpeace International in November 2009, when Gerd Leipold steps down after nearly nine years as our activist-in-chief. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/kumi-naidoo.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/kumi-naidoo.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi was part of the successful struggle against apartheid in his native South Africa. He is an activist and a Rhodes Scholar.  For ten years he was the General Secretary of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation. Today he sits on the board of Greenpeace Africa and chairs the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the founders of &lt;a href="http://www.whiteband.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Call to Action Against Poverty&lt;/a&gt;, which has grown since 2005 into a coalition of anti-poverty campaigners from over 100 countries. They apply public pressure on leaders to fulfil promises on aid, trade, debt, climate change and gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi brings with him a passion for activism, for non-violence and clear ideas for shaping the future of Greenpeace. His experiences in campaigning, fundraising, advocacy, policy work, networked organisations and leading through change will all be called upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The way Greenpeace works on all levels from confrontation to cooperation with governments and corporations is an inspiration. The mix of pragmatism and passion really gets things done and effects real change in the world. I believe that Greenpeace is one of the most precious assets the global community posses as a critical part in reversing the current fatal trajectory of our planet," says Kumi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"History teaches us that real change only comes when good men and womenare prepared to put their lives and personal safety on the line toadvance the cause of justice, equity and peace. I believe today thatGreenpeace is the leading organization in embracing that approach."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Chair of the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA), of which Greenpeace is a member, for the coming months he will focus his attention on generating civil society pressure and cooperation to demand a strong deal at the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen this December:  one which gets CO2 emissions under control, protects tropical rainforests, and replaces dirty fossil fuel energy with renewables and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/management/executive-director/"&gt; Gerd Leipold&lt;/a&gt; will remain at the helm until November, and has this to say about the successor he has already worked closely with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kumi has all of the qualities needed to take Greenpeace forward and lead it in the greatest challenge it and the world has ever faced: climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/"&gt; Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt; (Stichting Greenpeace Council), is the body that coordinates global Greenpeace policy and strategy, and is based in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt; The best way to welcome Kumi? Take action, of course! Demand world leaders personally attend the Copenhagen summit&lt;/a&gt;, and take personal responsibility for sealing the right deal to save our planet from runaway climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Food Security and Forest Protection in Cameroon</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/forests/solutions/Cameroon-Forest-Workshops/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Communities discuss innovations in small-scale farming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Responding to a recent spate of industrial palm oil projects in Cameroon, Greenpeace Africa is working with a Cameroonian NGO to show how small-scale farming projects are a better development option -- for communities on the ground and Cameroon's rainforests. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The rich forests of South West Cameroon support thousands of communities, by providing food, building materials and medicine. Greenpeace Africa is working with Cameroonian NGO ACDIC (Association Citoyenne pour la Defense des Interêts Collectifs) to assess how small-scale farming can offer a responsible development path, in contrast to a proposed industrial palm oil plantation in the region, which threatens local livelihoods and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/set1.jpg" alt="Cameroon Rainforest" width="720" height="274"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;The rainforest is home to many communities and is also a biodiversity hotspot of global importance. African Forest Elephants, whose numbers have collapsed due to habitat loss, still roam here, and endangered chimpanzees chatter in the canopy above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, representatives of local communities came together at a workshop held by Greenpeace Africa and ACDIC in the town of Kumba on April 16, to share ideas on &lt;a href="/international/Global/africa/publications/forests/Agriculture_FoodSecurity_EN.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;how to ensure food security and forest protection&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 90 people attended, and identified technical support for farmers, access to land, and producing food locally for local consumption as some of the key factors in achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/set2.jpg" alt="Community Resistance"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Communities affected by the Herakles project are mobilising themselves and investigating sustainable alternatives to industrial palm oil projects. Greenpeace has been working with local partners on the ground to support these efforts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a positive and viable alternative to the 73,000 hectare palm oil project proposed by US-based corporation Herakles Farms, which would jeopardize the livelihoods of more than 14,000 people who currently live and farm in the concession area. Fearful of losing their lands and livelihoods, some local people have protested against the project, and have faced intimidation and arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="274" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rPjacVLoApY?rel=0" width="687"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Watch this short video to find out more about the proposed Herakles palm oil project and the likely impact it will have on local communities, biodiversity, and the forest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for the palm oil industry and investors to implement a transparent ‘Zero Deforestation Policy’, which respects the rights and livelihoods of local communities and ensures the protection of natural forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="h11"&gt;Get Involved&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/exclamation.jpg" alt="action" width="84" height="96"&gt;Right now, the most important thing we can do to protect Cameroon's rainforest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is call for the Herakles palm oil project to be stopped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-africa/en/campaigns/Forests-hub/Palm-Oil-Deforestation/Save-the-Cameroonian-rainforest----stop-the-Herakles-Farms-project/" target="_blank"&gt;Take action here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	700 volunteers posed nude in a French vineyard to send a message about climate change. This human art installation in the South of Burgundy was created by artist Spencer Tunick - to warn about the dangers of global warming.

            Naked message: global warming could mean an end to the days of wine... and rosés.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Parental warning: the story below contains nudity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

	We chased it for 5 days, but as dawn broke over the Pacific this morning we finally confronted the biggest tuna fishing vessel in the world. The Spanish-owned and flagged tuna purse seiner "Albatun Tres" is known as a 'super, super seiner' and can net 3,000 tonnes of tuna in a single fishing trip. This is almost double the entire annual catch of some Pacific island countries.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The most devastatingly efficient tuna fishing vessel in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught this monstrous tuna catcher deploying its net close to the Phoenix Islands of Kiribati and witnessed many tonnes of tuna being taken out of the Pacific. We laid a 25-metre floating banner reading "No Fish, No Future"' across the inside of the net as it was being hauled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first found the Albatun Tres on May 22nd and tracked her across more than 1,000 nautical miles. Her crew must have noticed us when we came within visual range as they immediately steamed away at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to catch up with them when they stopped to fish, and as they pulled in their catch we showed up in inflatable boats, a jet ski and helicopter in order to expose their plunderous activities to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BA7enHKa5As?rel=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purse seine vessels surround schools of fish with curtain-like nets to catch tuna. A rope along the bottom of the net is pulled like a drawstring and the whole catch is hauled onboard. These vessels have increased their efficiency enormously in the last decade through a variety of technological innovations. While targeting skipjack tuna, these vessels also catch juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, as we witnessed this morning. This bycatch is seriously threatening the already vulnerable stocks of bigeye and yellowfin tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign fishing nations including those of the European Union (EU) are fishing unsustainably where Pacific island countries depend on tuna for income and food. The Albatun Tres arrived in the Pacific from the Indian Ocean earlier this year. It is owned by the Spanish tuna company Albacora, which is part of OPAGAC, a powerful association of Spanish tuna boat owners, processors and traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No more fish at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery, the world's biggest, has been subjected to intense fishing by fleets from Asia and the United States since the 1960s. With declining tuna stocks in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the European Union has gained access to this Pacific fishing ground as a reciprocal benefit for giving aid to Pacific countries. With their own waters fished out, the EU and other foreign fishing fleets including Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the US, are literally sailing across the world to take vital fish and income from people whose lives depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe align="middle" frameborder="0" height="430" scrolling="no" src="http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?user_id=16093524@N00&amp;amp;set_id=72157605296853768" width="430"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super seiners of OPAGAC have a questionable history in the region and some of the vessels which they currently represent were pirate fishing in the area last year. Just when the Pacific fishing fleets need to be reduced we have found evidence to show that OPAGAC is trying to expand their fishing capacity here. This group of companies has no shame and targets the poorest and most vulnerable countries in order to gain access to Pacific waters. Greenpeace is urging Pacific island countries to cease any future dealings with OPAGAC. Vessels of this size need to be taken off the water and scrapped immediately in order to address the overcapacity of the world's tuna fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship Esperanza has been in the region for the last eight weeks highlighting the overfishing of tuna. During this time we have taken action against fishing fleets from Taiwan, Korea, the US, the Philippines and now Spain.  At the same time, our ship Arctic Sunrise has been taking action against overfishing of tuna &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/"&gt; in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Dead oceans? Dead planet. Help us preserve one of the planet's life support systems by setting aside 40 percent of the world's oceans as marine reserves. Our seas need time to recover.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The emerging power of Japan’s ‘Hydrangea’ revolution</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2012/The-emerging-power-of-Japans-Hydrangea-revolution/</url><text>
	Like the flower it has been named after, a budding civil movement is emerging and taking root in Japan to protest against the government’s decision to restart the Ohi nuclear plant.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The restart, just 18 months after the devastating tsunami and resulting nuclear Fukushima nuclear disaster last year, has sparked indignation and alarm in a Japanese society left scarred by the catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a nation not especially known for public protests or civil disobedience, the rolling demonstrations in Japan this week and last suggest a major shift in Japanese society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/international/Global/international/photos/nuclear/2012/Japan-Nuclear.jpg" alt="Junichi Sato" width="300" height="200"&gt;This movement against nuclear energy has been named after the Hydrangea, a flower the Japanese have traditionally loved because it blooms in June and July, giving hope during the dark, rainy season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The symbolism of the flower is strikingly synonymous with the growing civil movement against nuclear power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born out of the aftermath of arguably one of Japan’s darkest hours, the movement offers hope and is gathering in numbers – similar to how the Hydrangea forms its flower; each small flower bunches together to form a bigger, more vibrant, flower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, stood with trembling excitement among tens of thousands of people shouting “Saikado Hantai” (No Restart of Nuclear Plant) in front of the gate of the prime minister’s office in Tokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protestors had emerged to object to a decision from Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to restart the first nuclear reactor following the 3/11 disaster.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heading up the stairs from the subway station towards the demonstration, I could already feel the powerful energy of the protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even mothers with small children, the future of Japan, were holding handmade banners saying “NO NUKES”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Held on a Friday night, city workers in suits left their offices to join the protest after work. They too were holding placards in a protest that is truly made up of diverse parts of Japanese society.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The last time I saw a crowd of people that came close to this was a march in 2003, when the Japanese people voiced their opposition to war in Iraq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, however, the atmosphere of the protest was different. It was not organised by an organisation and was absent of flags and banners brandishing a single group’s name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, people simply came to protest because they wanted to be there and directly communicate their concerns to the prime minister. That is why I felt the power of the message: it came from individuals. It was extraordinarily energizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing civil society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2008, I was arrested and later sentenced to a suspended prison term because I had stood up for the public good; exposing scandals in the subsidised Japanese whaling industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been an extremely hard fight to have the ideal of ‘freedom of expression’ recognised in conservative Japanese society. Generally, people have believed that the government and big corporations are always right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A parliamentary report released this week blamed lax safety measures at the country’s nuclear plants due to what it called the country’s powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is now starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 3/11 disaster has changed people’s understanding and undermined their trust in the government and big corporations. Citizens have become more critical of government information and are more open to protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, the protest spilled over from pedestrian paths onto the six-lane road in front of the prime minister’s house. Effectively, they marched on the street and occupied it. A follow-up protest will soon be held at the same location. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the first nuclear reactor was restarted this week, I am sure that politicians are feeling the power of ‘Revolution Hydrangea 紫陽花革命’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join us, support the citizens of Japan and be part of the Hydrangea Revolution.&lt;br&gt;Create a twitter storm to tell the Japanese Prime Minister Noda ‘#紫陽花革命’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply copy the Japanese characters (Saikado Hantai) below to tweet @kantei, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;再稼働反対 Japanese Prime Minister Noda, #DontRestartNukes. @kantei  #紫陽花革命&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together we can take hold of a nuclear-free future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saikado Hantai 再稼働反対!!&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Dirty Laundry Reloaded into your washing-machine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/Detox-campaign/Dirty-Laundry-Reloaded-into-your-washing-machine/</url><text>
	Global fashion brands are turning us into unwitting polluters. This is what we discovered in our latest research conducted on clothing and sportswear produced by big companies such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Ralph Lauren and G-Star. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03T7L.jpg" alt="How big brands are making consumers unwitting accomplices in the toxic water cycle" width="600" height="127"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested products that we &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt;knew contained residues of toxic substances&lt;/a&gt; by washing them under conditions that simulated domestic laundering. Then we measured how much of the chemicals remained in the clothing. In this way we could identify the percentage of "washed out" chemicals which end up being flushed into our rivers, lakes and seas, where they break down to form even more hazardous substances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are these substances?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These chemicals have some nasty properties. For example, NPEs breaks down into nonylphenols, chemicals which are persistent, bio-accumulative and hormone-disrupting. This means that they do not break down easily into the environment, build up in the food chain, and can seriously mess with some organisms' hormone systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03TE0.jpg" alt="Clothing and the Global Toxic Water Cycle" width="600" height="335"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigative work: Dirty Laundry part one, two and three.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year we published &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/" target="_blank"&gt;our investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealing how the suppliers of major clothing brands were discharging hazardous chemicals in their waste water directly into Chinese rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We challenged the brands found to be in business with these suppliers to take responsibility for this pollution, and to use their considerable influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate these toxic discharges throughout their supply chain and products.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p class="description"&gt;As much as 70 percent of China's rivers, lakes and reservoirs are affected by water pollution. During our recent investigations, Greenpeace identified links between a number of major clothing brands and textile factories in China that are releasing hazardous chemicals into our rivers. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p class="copyright"&gt;© Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;Some brands accepted&lt;/a&gt; the challenge and have begun working on a detailed plan to reach the goal by 2020. Others insisted that these chemicals were not used in their manufacturing their products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We tested the products of a number of the brands linked to these suppliers and found residues of hazardous chemicals in their clothing proving that these hazardous substances had been used in the manufacturing of their products. The results of this investigation were published in the report&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt; 'Dirty Laundry - Hung out to dry'&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The residues we found might seem small in quantity if considered compared to the single piece of clothing. But there is no safe amount of toxic chemicals, and given the huge volume of garments produced by these global brands, the total quantities of these chemicals entering our water is far from insignificant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our latest investigation tested clothing we had found containing these hazardous substances to find out what happens during normal washing conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results implicate anyone who buys these brands and washes their clothes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03T7K.jpg" alt="NPE Maps" width="487" height="536"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textile industry is creating water pollution &lt;strong&gt;all around the globe&lt;/strong&gt;, including those regions and countries where there are restrictions or bans on the use of these chemicals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero discharge of hazardous chemicals within a generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire textile sector needs to move to toxic-free processes. To reach this goal we need more brands joining the detox challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the companies which have already committed to the elimination of the use of these substances, the next step is for them to respond to the urgency of the situation by setting strict and ambitious elimination deadlines for the most hazardous chemicals used by this sector, including nonylphenol ethoxylates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know these chemicals are dangerous, and viable alternatives exist so these big brand names need to turn their words into actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of you already joined together to put pressure on these brands to "Detox", and thanks to your efforts, Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&amp;amp;M, Li-Ning and C&amp;amp;A have all committed to eliminate the use of all hazardous chemicals from their supply chain and products by 2020 .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;You can take action today by:&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing this story with your friends and family to help raise awareness of the issue&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/People-Power/" target="_blank"&gt;latest campaign video &lt;/a&gt;which shows the role of #PeoplePower in shaking up the fashion sector &lt;br&gt;-    &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/what-you-can-do/star-in-our-next-video/" target="_blank"&gt;Submitting your photo &lt;/a&gt;to help star in the next #PeoplePowered campaign video while pushing your favorite brand to be the next to Detox&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict. Reaching the most affected populations with the aid continuesto be a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McVictory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Victory as fast food giant pledges to help protect the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Red Carpet Four out of jail - but face trial for climate action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/out-of-jail-060110/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Activists need support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Danish police today released from custody four Greenpeace climate protesters who have endured 20 days of pre-trial detention in Copenhagen prison following a harmless peaceful protest staged on the evening of 17 December. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/1/red-carpet-four-activists-sp-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/1/red-carpet-four-activists-sp-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Free at last! "Red Carpet Four" activists speak with journalists after their release from prison. They were held without trial for 20 days.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20 days in prison without trial, the four activists who became known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-heroes-pay-231209/"&gt; "Red Carpet Four"&lt;/a&gt; have been released from prison. Their "crime"? Impressing on world leaders the urgency of action on climate change at a State dinner during the Copenhagen climate summit. Their release comes a day in advance of their detention being reviewed by a Danish judge. However, the four activists still face trial in the Danish courts, and possible prison sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unnecessary detention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the arrests of the Four, Greenpeace guaranteed - as it does in cases where volunteers are involved in peaceful protests - that, if the activists were released, they would voluntarily return to Copenhagen to stand trial. To further facilitate the police investigation, Greenpeace consistently offered its full co-operation to Danish police and provided them with comprehensive details of the activity. A request from Greenpeace asking the Danish police to specify what additional information they needed to know in connection with the case was met with two weeks of silence on the part of the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such prolonged pre-trial detention appears to be a flagrant violation of key articles of international human rights &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;agreements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British human rights lawyer Richard Harvey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only on Tuesday 5 January, did Danish police finally request the names of other individuals who had been in the Greenpeace 'motorcade' on 17 December. Today, these individuals volunteered their details, removing the last conceivable reason for detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish police proved unco-operative in the face of honest efforts on our part to find compromise. As a result, the four activists spent Christmas and New Year in jail, far from their family and without visitation rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Necessary action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 17 December, three of the activists posed as the "Head of State of the Natural World", his "wife" and their security detail. They were waved through the security cordon surrounding the Danish Parliament. Arriving inside the venue for the State banquet they unfolded banners reading, "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of State met the next day for the final sessions of the Copenhagen climate summit. They came no further than producing an empty shell of a document - the 'Copenhagen Accord'. Only five pages in length - two of which contain only blank tables - it contains no legally binding targets for limiting emissions of global warming gases. The summit merely "noted" but did not adopt the Accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24934/delegation-from-earth-about-to.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 13,000 people gave their support to the Red Carpet Four in 24 hours, and announced their support for future civil disobedience. Action is needed and expected from true world leaders in the face of the grave threat of Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, world leaders let the opportunity for agreeing a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement slip through their fingers. We cannot let them fail again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as our 'leaders' behave like 'losers', and continue to drag their feet, they can expect more and more people to find creative ways of expressing their concern and building up pressure for change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our four activists who grabbed global media attention last week after being waved through the security cordon and allowed to gatecrash the Heads of State dinner at the Copenhagen climate summit will be spending Christmas and New Year in jail without trial, the Danish High Court has ruled.

            Greenpeace's state dinner gatecrashers deliver climate message in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gave up their freedom to get a message out calling for action against climate. Don't let in be in vain. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt; Please support our new campaign to keep the pressure on world leaders for a real climate deal in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the Heroes from Norway, Spain and Switzerland were arrested after entering the banquet for world leaders, hosted by the Danish Queen Margrethe II. Two of them were dressed as a 'Head of State' and his 'wife', the third their security detail. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/xmas-in-jail-for-climate-activists201209/"&gt; They held up banners that read "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act"&lt;/a&gt; and were led away by police. Danish police later pulled in a fourth activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While real world leaders came to the summit, ate cake, and departed with an empty political agreement that leaves the future of the planet and millions of lives in peril, our four activists will be held in police custody without bail or trial until January 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-violent, creative action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace's Climate Heroes were willing to risk their freedom for a cause," said Mads Christensen, Executive Director of Greenpeace Nordic. "Preventing them from spending the festive season with their families and loved ones is effectively a punishment without trial and has the appearance of a vindictive act. It is unnecessary and totally out of proportion to what they did", said Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condemning the High Court's decision as a further "climate injustice" on top of the collossal political failure at the summit, we're is calling on the public to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwqGDF9IBKQ"&gt;help step up pressure&lt;/a&gt; for the activists' release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the High Court's ruling, their freedom remains at the discretion of Denmark's Chief of Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using only simple props, creativity and a little "audacity of hope" the activists arrived ahead of Hillary Clinton, carrying out an entirely peaceful call for action. Their message helped give voice to the hundreds of millions of people who rarely get the ear of politicians, even as their lives and ecosystems are progressively destroyed as politicians waffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24936/climate_shame.jpg" alt="Climate Shame protest after Copenhagen summit cop-out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Real Crime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historic climate summit which people around the world have been anticipating for the last year resulted in &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/copenhagen-wrap-up-191209/"&gt; what is called the 'Copenhagen Accord'&lt;/a&gt; - an empty document containing no legally binding commitments for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mads Christensen summed up the situation: "Over the past 20 years, our leaders have done virtually nothing to combat climate change. The Copenhagen climate summit was the moment for decisive action. But our leaders failed us. They failed to agree a legally binding treaty to prevent the Earth from warming beyond the crucial threshold of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond this, we can expect impacts to severely affect the survival and wellbeing of millions of people and countless species. Failure to take action to protect the climate is not an option."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act Now - Change the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt;It's time to put politicians on notice! Every email raised in protest about their failure is a step towards forcing them to act in all our interests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make a donation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace relies on individual donations to keep us going, since we don't take government or corporate funds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Four of our activists face the prospect of Christmas in jail this year over charges relating to our crashing of the Head of State dinner at the Copenhagen climate summit, while the leaders who did practically nothing about the greatest threat to our planet got away scott free.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called for the immediate release of our people at a candle-lit vigil on Saturday night outside the Vestre Fængsel prison, in Copenhagen. Over 100 Greenpeace staff and supporters held banners reading "Freedom From Climate Injustice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Crime Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Copenhagen has become a 'climate crime scene' after over 120 Heads of State squandered an historic opportunity to agree a climate saving deal," said Kumi Naidoo, our International Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the perpetrators of the real crime fled the country on private jets, it is shocking that the Danish authorities have decided to detain, without trial, four peaceful protesters over Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Their families will spend a bleak festive season knowing that their loved ones will be languishing in isolation for acting to save the climate. For standing up in defense of the hundreds of millions of people and countless species which will be severely affected by catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kids around the Christmas tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the activists have children at home who will be missing a parent this Christmas. The activists - Juan Lopez de Uralde, Nora Christiansen and Christian Schmutz - are the climate heroes who brought home to world leaders attending last Thursday's banquet with Queen Margrethe the message that leaders were failing the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, police also arrested Joris Thijssen, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace International. He is being held under the same conditions as the other three activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists joined Heads of State from over 120 countries en route to the banquet at the Danish Parliament. Arriving in a three-vehicle convoy, immediately in front of Hilary Clinton, a Greenpeace 'Head of State' and his 'wife' stepped out onto the red carpet as representatives of the millions of people around the world who wanted a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty to head-off climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding up banners reading: "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act", the activists demanded action and not merely words from Presidents and Prime Ministers during their Friday session of the climate summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How far will you go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders have failed us. They have walked away from the global summit in Copenhagen without a treaty to save the climate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not done yet, and neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 15 million people joined in the call from Greenpeace and the other tcktcktck partners such as Avaaz, 350, Oxfam, and WWF, to demand a fair, ambitious, binding treaty to stop climate change. And until we have that, we're going to continue building the biggest mass movement the world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juantxo, Joris, Nora, and Christian were willing to risk jail time to do something about climate change. What are you going to do? You can start by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/become-a-climate-activist?appeal_id=000"&gt; signing up as a climate activist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tens of millions of people around the world who have been working so long and so hard for a fair, ambitious and legally binding (FAB) treaty to come out of the Copenhagen climate summit, I held on to my hope until the very end. My hope our leaders would stop talking and start acting. That they would agree a treaty to avert the threat of climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope has been dashed. Despite a mandate from citizens around the world, and over 120 world leaders attending the Summit, the bickering continued. Our leaders did not lead, they did not act. The summit has failed to produce anything that could be called a FAB deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a chance to change the world. To seize the day, and put us on a path way to peace and prosperity. To embark on a path of climate justice. In doing so, they could have banished the spectre of catastrophic climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust went missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust between developed and developing countries played a large role in preventing any real progress. Leaders from industrialised countries have had plenty of time to commit to ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions and to find the billions of dollars needed to help developing countries both adapt to and mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries showed a willingness throughout the year to take on their share of the effort. Developed countries  failed to move far enough. Bringing up the rear has been the US. It must take the lion's share of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beating climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists around the world tell us we have to ensure global emissions peak by 2015 in order to avoid average global temperature rising more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, industrialised countries as a group - which have the greatest historic responsibility for the problem - must make the largest emission cuts. They also need to provide at least USD 140 billion a year to help developing countries get onto a clean energy pathway, to protect tropical forests, and to adapt to those climate change impacts that are unfortunately now inevitable.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any agreement must be enshrined in a legally binding treaty. This is the job the politicians did not do in Copenhagen.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make them finish what they started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now our job -  yours and mine - to make sure  our 'leaders' see sense, get back to work  get the job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, like many other groups around the world, will continue to peacefully pressure our leaders to do what must be done to save human lives and protect species which cannot speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people are recognising the urgency of climate change. We believe there is an historic inevitability of forcing nations to act. The question is, whether we can force them to take the necessary action soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The final rub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel irony I have just learned that the three Greenpeace activists who, posing as world leaders, entered the Danish Palace for the State Dinner on Thursday night to unfurl a banner calling for a real climate deal are to spend the next three weeks in jail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be away from their families over Christmas and the New Year. The real  leaders, who attempted to get real action are now in jail, while the alleged 'leaders' got clean away, and are fleeing the Copenhagen climate crime scene in private jets and 747s.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rushmore activists sentenced for civil disobedience</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/civil-disobedience-in-jail-050110/</url><text>
	Civil disobedience to stop climate change had its day in court in the US yesterday when activists pled guilty to climbing Mount Rushmore with their message demanding Obama take leadership on climate change. Four other climate activists who have spent three weeks in jail in Copenhagen for gate crashing a Head of State dinner still await their first hearing.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what civil disobedience for the climate looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eleven climate activists who proudly staged an historic protest at Mount Rushmore last July appeared in court yesterday for sentencing. All eleven pled guilty to the charge of Climbing Mount Rushmore and received a fine of US$ 460 each. They will also perform 50-100 hours of community service in the National Park system depending on their individual sentences. The judge requested that some or all of that service be performed at Mt. Rushmore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three further charges against the activists were dismissed, as were all charges against Greenpeace.  In a civil decree, Greenpeace has agreed to pay a sum of US$ 30,866, most of which will go to conservation and public park programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single activist who has a history of peaceful civil disobedience was sentenced to 2 days of jail time, which he has already begun serving.&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all the activists, Jessica Miller delivered a statement on the steps of the courthouse: "We climbed Mount Rushmore because we wanted to send a message to President Obama that this is an issue that is important to us, and to the future generations who will face the increasing impacts of global warming, like drought, severe weather and the loss of millions of lives around the world. Global warming is the most important crisis our generation must tackle, and it is time for all of us to stand up to stop it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action at Rushmore sent loud call for climate leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 8th, 2009, Greenpeace activists draped an enormous banner to the right of Lincoln's head on Mt. Rushmore. The banner bore an image of President Obama and read, "America Honors Leaders, Not Politicians: Stop Global Warming" - a challenge to President Obama to take a strong stance on climate change in the leadup to December's UN climate summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the most important issue the world faces today. If our leaders do not act, individual citizens have the right to resort to civil disobedience to protect the future of our planet.  Actions designed to spur politicians to action against global warming are themselves a form of community service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	We thought it unfair that among the Heads of State invited to the Queen's dinner in Copenhagen, that a representative of the whole planet wasn't invited. Earth needed a voice, it needed representation. So we sent two to crash the party.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Delegation from Earth about to be evicted from Danish Queen's dinner party with 100 heads of state at Copenhagen climate summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the Copenhagen climate summit comes to a close, the future of our planet lies in the hands of world leaders that have just breezed into town. And somehow, instead of getting down to the nitty gritty, they were dining with the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders might have been expecting just another photo opportunity in Copenhagen, but that was before we invited ourselves to dinner. We thought they might need a reminder it's time to step forward and steer these climate negotiations in the right direction on the final day of talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only precious hours left till the end of the summit, activists in a three-car convoy joined the motorcade, carrying our very own Head of State to the dinner at the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival, our distinguished representative and her husband entered the dinner and held up two banners reading "Politicians Talk Leaders Act." They were there to represent the 11 million of you that have demanded that world leaders take personal responsibility at the summit and deliver a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure they got the message loud and clear, 25 activists scaled lampposts outside of the security cordon with banners demanding action from the world leaders on their way to dinner.  "Don't betray our children's future" was projected onto the Parliament building itself, as well as the Prime Minister's office, in English, French and German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the industrialised world has failed to show anything like the leadership that is urgently needed to get a deal that will prevent climate change from spiraling out of control. Their lack of action will condemn millions of people to ever-increasing impacts of climate chaos. We can't let them get away with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, they promised us a real deal to save the climate and that deal would be agreed in Copenhagen, now. The time has come for world leaders to deliver on their promises and sign a deal with long term financing, ambitious emissions cuts and that is legally binding. They have the power to make it happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your voice heard and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;join the 13 million people that have demanded action on climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;13 Million people have demanded a fair ambitious binding treaty to stop climate change. Let's make it 15 million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;Your contributions are what keep us in action. We don't let corporations or governments feed us, so we're free to bite their hands. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/rainbow-warrior-ii-sailing-thr.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior delivers MSF aid to Beirut</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rainbow-warrior-lebanon-msf-070806/</url><text>
	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict. Reaching the most affected populations with the aid continuesto be a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McVictory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Victory as fast food giant pledges to help protect the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	We don’t think the Amazon should be cut down for chicken feed. And from Brazil to Europe, our activists have faced violence and arrest to protest this environmental crime.

            KFC is implicated in Amazon destruction
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our investigative report, 'Eating up the Amazon' showed how soya beans grown in the Amazon were going into many fast-food items in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among them, soy grown by clearing the Amazon is going into the making of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). And some people don’t want us to do anything about that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists attacked, arrested:&lt;/span&gt; Violence erupted at an illegal soy export facility in the Amazon as employees and associates of Cargill, owner and operator of the port, targeted Greenpeace activists who were protesting the continued destruction of the Amazon rainforest for growing soy. Despite the Cargill port being built in violation of Brazilian law, it continues to operate. Soy exported from this port go to many parts of the world including Europe where it is used to feed animals destined to be fried-up in fast food outlets like KFC.  Activists in Europe have &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/greenpeace-slams-us-commoditie/"&gt; shut down Cargill plants in France and the UK&lt;/a&gt; in solidarity with their Brazilian colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a report from Gavin Edwards, our international forest campaigner, about his arrival in Brazil:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been in the Amazon almost a week now and from the moment I arrived I stepped into a very polarized battle over the future of the Amazon. My first indication of the tension was a bumper sticker on a truck outside the airport with the words 'Fora Greenpeace', meaning 'Greenpeace Out'. Many more of these stickers were on trucks around the town of Santarem. It turns out that by showing this sticker on your car or truck, you receive a discount on petrol at a local gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An editorial in the local newspaper Journal de Santarem was also quite damning of Greenpeace, attempting to link us to everything from hunger to abortion, but of course failed to discuss the real issue, the ongoing and rampant deforestation and unsustainable development in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first protest involved simply parachuting an activist into a soy field with a message written on the parachute, and even this was enough to bring out a small group of angry farmers -- the parachutist had a narrow escape. Our next attempt to protest at the forest destruction over the weekend was to have 80 people in a deforested area to make a human banner, arranging the people's bodies to spell out the protest message. This activity was cancelled due to the strong possibility of violence from the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="KFC banner" src="/international/PageFiles/25551/kfcbanner.jpg" alt="KFC banner" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the violence directed towards us, a team of activists on boats projected a video on soy and deforestation in front of the town of Santarem on Saturday night. Many of the local &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos &lt;/span&gt;are actually farmers from the south of Brazil who have recently moved to Santarem in pursuit of land grabbing and profits from deforestation and farming.  Their reaction was swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes a mob assembled and began firing fireworks at our volunteers. They assaulted one of our photographers, and the photographer of a local newspaper as well. This time it seems the local hooligans (who are a small minority) went too far, and the mood in Santarem has swung against them. The subsequent editorial in the Gazeta de Santarem is quite different from earlier criticisms. It deplores the use of violence by the farmers, questions why the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos&lt;/span&gt; are being violent towards Greenpeace, and wonders if the&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; gauchos &lt;/span&gt;will next turn on the people of Santarem with their tactics of fear and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gazeta de Santarem has front-page headlines and photos of the soy producers attacking the photographer, and a quote from one soy producer saying that Santarem is only full of Indians and lazy people. Now the bumper stickers on trucks seem to be fewer and fewer. The tide may well be turning against the soy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're keeping up the pressure on the big soy producers like Cargill over the next few days, including unfurling a protest banner in a deforested area today with the words '&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken – Amazon Criminal&lt;/span&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more activities planned in the Amazon, and we're sure those with an economic interest in forest destruction will continue with their violent tactics. For now however, it seems that peace is beginning to win over violence in Santarem, and it looks like there is a real chance that the Amazon may remain mostly green, if our supporters keep up the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

	Perhaps more than anyone else, Bob Hunter invented Greenpeace.  His death on May 2nd 2005, of cancer, marks the passing of a true original, one of the heroes of the environmental movement. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bob Hunter (left) with Ben Metcalfe, aboard the first Greenpeace voyage to oppose nuclear weapons testing in Amchitka.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the word "Greenpeace" hadn't yet been coined. Bob was a hippy journalist in Vancouver, a town which he described as having "the biggest concentration of tree-huggers, radicalized students, garbage-dump stoppers, shit-disturbing unionists, freeway fighters, pot smokers and growers, aging Trotskyites, condo killers, farmland savers, fish preservationists, animal rights activists, back-to-the-landers, vegetarians, nudists, Buddhists, and anti-spraying, anti-pollution marchers and picketers in the country, per capita, in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind bombs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student of Marshall McLuhan, he was bent on changing the world with what he termed "media mindbombs" -- consciousness-changing sounds and images to blast around the world in the guise of news. He got involved with a few folks in a church basement who wanted to stop a US nuclear weapons test off Amchitka, which he called the "Don't Make a Wave Committee".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sailing into the bomb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their plans were going nowhere until Marie Bohlen suggested that the group simply sail a ship into the test site. Bob thought it was a perfect "mindbomb," and on September 15, 1971, he and 11 other rag-tag activists would sail out to challenge the greatest military force on Earth in a rusting fishing boat they called "The Greenpeace." In doing so, they set off a wave of public support and protest which closed the US-Canadian border for the first time since 1812, ultimately shut the testing programme down, and created a new force for environmental and peace activism which continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace bears his mark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, Bob's madcap creativity, strategic smarts, and hard-nosed journalistic sense of story would indelibly mark the Greenpeace brand of action. From the pack ice of Newfoundland, where he dyed the whitecoats of Harp Seal pups to make them commercially worthless, to the Pacific Ocean where he stood between Russian harpoons and the whales they were hunting, he inspired a new brand of personal environmental activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaman, mystic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bob was a storyteller, a shaman, a word-magician, a Machiavellian mystic, and he dared to inject a sense of humour into the often shrill and sanctimonious job of changing the world," says Greenpeace Executive Director Gerd Leipold. "He was funny and brave and audacious, inspiring in his refusal to accept the limits of the practical or the probable. He revelled in life's ability to deliver little miracles in the form of impossibilities achieved, and Greenpeace will forever bear the mark of his crazy, super-optimistic faith in the wisdom of tilting at windmills."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warriors of the Rainbow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Hunter chronicled the birth of Greenpeace in his book "Warriors of the Rainbow." It was a masterful feat of storytelling, one which attracted a further generation of young people into the ranks of the organisation. In its introduction he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We fought... an unequal battle against American and French nuclear weapons makers; Russian, Japanese, and Australian whalers; Norwegian and Canadian seal hunters; multinational oil consortiums and pesticide manufactures; cynical politicians; angry workers; and, again and again, ourselves. The people involved were men and women, young and old, not all of them brave or wise, who found themselves face-to-face with the fullest ecological horrors of the century..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storymaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Hunter's stock stories was the tale of how he'd stumbled on to the Cree Indian myth of the "Warriors of the Rainbow" -- a legendary tribe of spirits who would rescue nature when the Earth became sick. The story involved a gypsy dulcimer maker, an old set of fenceposts, and the gift of a book which Hunter claimed leapt into his hands -- quite literally -- when The Greenpeace dropped down a steep swell on its way to Amchitka. The story itself was magical and mythological, and over the years Hunter would embellish and polish it into a hilarious and inspirational piece of campfire folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awful child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1941. In his own words "I was an awful, rebellious, early attention-defficient kid who was loved by my art and English teachers, but hated by the rest. I cheated by scribbling novels when I was supposed to be doing schoolwork." He became a journalist for the Winnipeg Tribune and later wrote a column for the Vancouver Sun in which he featured environmental subjects. He quit writing the column when he joined the first Greenpeace voyage to save the whales, becoming a reporter explicitly to ensure his somewhat less than objective "message" would reach a global audience, because "the subjective stuff written by columnists [was] never picked up by the wire services."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalism as opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He readily confessed that this made him "a traitor to my profession," but believed he had a higher calling: "If we ignore [the] laws of ecology we will continue to be guilty of crimes against the earth. We will not be judged by men for these crimes, but with a justice meeted out by the earth itself. The destruction of the earth will lead, inevitably, to the destruction of ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter became president of the Greenpeace Foundation in 1973, and served in that post until 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Toronto's City TV as an ecology specialist in 1988, and for years hosted a highly successful morning TV spot for Breakfast TV in his bathrobe, in which he read the day's newspaper headlines and sputtered scandalously witty commentaries in a form of rapid-fire stand-up journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisor, speaker, comedian-in-chief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years he continued to contribute to Greenpeace as an advisor and occasional speaker, and kept up good relations with the organisation's original luminaries, including many who were no longer on speaking terms with one other. He authored several books and founded a tongue-in-cheek religion, the Whole Earth Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent book, Rex Weyler writes about reflecting with Hunter on their experiences in the early days of Greenpeace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ironies and tension of history simultaneously provided the gift of history: that we got to live, to see the flourishing Earth, the flying fish, dolphins, caribou, seal pups, the raging sea, the blue light of morning, the miracle and terror of survival all rolled into one; and that we were blessed with an opportunity to serve it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Hunter made much of his opportunity to serve the Earth, and Greenpeace will always be blessed with his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

	"It is 8:30 am and I and 30 activists have been sitting on drilling platform #4 for an hour and a half. We can see workers from the Defense Construction Agency gathering on the beach of Camp Schwab, the US Marine Corp base at Henoko, Okinawa. They are about to board a chartered fishing boat and come out and try to drill the first of 64 holes into the life sustaining coral reef. But for the 300th consecutive day, we are not going to let them." - Yuka Ozaki, 500m off the coast of Japan.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A gentle dugong near Okinawa, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, construction of a US Marine Corps airbase for helicopters at Henoko, Okinawa, off the coast of Japan was agreed. The planned 2,600-meter runway complete with hangers, control towers and fuel storage was even being funded by Japanese taxpayers to the tune of US$10 billion. That US$10 billion is set to pay for the destruction of the habitat of sea life such as the gentle dugong - only 12 of which are confirmed to remain in Japanese waters. The beautiful Okinawa reef is home to Japan's last remaining population of critically endangered dugong, as well as other marine mammals and sea turtles. The UN Environment Programme has called for the creation of a marine reserve to protect the dugong. Instead the plan is to dynamite the reef and build the runway through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local opposition has been so strong that construction was not started until late 2004. In 1997, local people voted overwhelmingly to reject the base, but the local mayor was forced by the central government to agree to the project. He resigned in disgrace after signing the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.or.jp/dugong/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25875/okinawa_action.jpg" alt="" align="middle" border="0"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org/henoko" target="_blank"&gt;Make the virtual airbase disappear in the online protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courageous local residents, however, have so far been successful in preventing the drilling of test holes into the sensitive coral reef. Every day for the last 300 days they have occupied the drilling towers about half a kilometre offshore, preventing any further construction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 84-year-old local man said, "We know for sure, that building the airbase is not the right thing to do. There are a plenty of sea creatures which are supporting our life here. We always appreciate the richness of ocean life: we have top shell, octopus, magaki-shell and seaweed. Once the base is built, there will be no future for our children. I can't let it disappear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Rainbow Warrior arrives to support these local residents and try to ensure a US military base doesn't mean the demise of the Okinawa dugong.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Asian Tsunami: environmental and humanitarian disaster</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tsunami-and-the-environment/</url><text>
	On December 26 a massive tsunami swept through the Indian Ocean region to become arguably the largest natural disaster in living memory. Questions are now being asked: what are the environmental impacts of this tragedy?  Did damaged environments contribute to the extent of the impact? And perhaps most importantly, what can be done to make sure that the long-term welfare of survivors is considered?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/humanitarian-and-medical-aid-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/humanitarian-and-medical-aid-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Humanitarian and medical aid organised by Medecins Sans Frontieres is being loaded onto the Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, is currently assisting the French organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in delivering emergency relief aid. Greenpeace activists have been involved in the relief effort in India, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere since December 26. Although we are not an aid organisation, we felt this was the best way we could contribute most effectively. The Rainbow Warrior was already in the region and access to many of the most remote and isolated areas is only possible by ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Environmental impacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are also beginning to explore the possibilities of contributing to assessments of the environmental impacts caused by the tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial reports indicate that natural ecological systems such as coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands have suffered extensive impacts. Important research facilities for studying and monitoring these environments are reportedly also severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tsunami has highlighted the vulnerability of the sensitive marine environments, such as mangroves, that are the breeding grounds for many marine species and that represent the livelihood of thousands of communities that depend on them for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is undertaking a full environmental impact assessment of this natural disaster, and this, in conjunction with the various other initiatives underway, should lead to a good understanding of the scale and extent of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Redeveloping for the future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that healthy mangroves and coral reefs formed an essential defence against the tsunami. Damage appears to be much worse in areas where these natural defences were destroyed or degraded by shrimp farming and irresponsible coastal development for industry and tourism. Any recovery effort should ensure the conservation and restoration of these vital coastal ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the protection of human life in such an extreme event, but also considering the resilience of ecological systems, it is essential that redevelopment proceeds with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course right now we must give our efforts to those who have suffered in this tragedy. We have and will continue to offer support to MSF during the relief effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the most urgent needs are met, and the focus falls more clearly upon redevelopment and reconstruction, then we will contribute to recovery efforts to ensure that the approach to reconstruction addresses both short and longer term social and environmental needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A container ship currently heading from southern India to the US represents a small victory in the fight against corporate crime across the globe. The ship is carrying 320 tonnes of toxic mercury contaminated waste which comes from a closed plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of consumer products giant Unilever.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unilever agrees to clean up its toxic mercury mess in south India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unilever mercury thermometer production plant was set up in TamilNadu, India in 1983 after being shipped wholesale from it previous location in New York State in the US. It is a classic tactic of the chemical industry to ship plants that are too dirty or inefficient for the US or Europe to areas such as India and extend their life where environmental and safety standards are lower. Hence the industry can continue to make profits from pollution for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Moving the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant at Kodaikanal imported mercury from the US and re-exported the thermometers back to the US. Mercury is a potent toxin affecting the nervous system of people and animals and a highly dangerous pollutant. Lax safety standards at the plant left workers with mercury poisoning and large amounts of mercury contaminated waste were dumped in the surrounding areas in complete disregard for the local communities by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local environmental groups and Greenpeace first exposed the mercury dumping scandal in May 2001. Subsequent protests by locals forced the closure of the plant but the contaminated waste was left littering the site and surrounding area. Investigations by the pollution control authorities revealed the pollution to be far worse than the company had admitted with soil contamination 600-800 the legal levels and approximately 17 times more mercury was unaccounted for than the company estimates. The authorities ordered the company to clean up the site and safely treat the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananthapadmanabhan, one of our campaigners in India, is studying the clean up: "We will be keeping a close watch on all future remedial actions by the company. Several thousand tonnes of toxic wastes and contaminated soil are still to be properly identified and contained. Now that the clean up has begun in earnest, compensation and health care for affected ex-workers should be immediately brought on to the agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste will be treated at a special plant in the US. The start of the clean up is a big victory for campaigners in India where other polluted hotspots cause by irresponsible companies, like Bhopal, abound.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mad Max is here</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Mad-Max-is-here/</url><text>
	We went on an expedition to see up close — and from above, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) — the real situation of the main reservoirs of the south-eastern Brazil. What we saw shows that the worst of the water crisis is yet to come.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" src="/international/Global/international/photos/forests/2015/mad-max-is-here.jpg" alt="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" width="800" height="532"&gt;Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: "Without Forests, There's No Water" © Greenpeace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out onto the "craquelure" bottom of a bone dry reservoir gives one a sinking feeling. Actually, the realization that we were not on the set of a post-apocalyptic film, like "Mad Max", but rather in the middle of an enormous reservoir that until just recently supplied millions of people with water, is enough to send anyone into despair. We were at the Serra Azul reservoir, in Minas Gerais, one of the main parts of the Paraopeba System, which ensures – or ensured – water for most of Greater Belo Horizonte and its 5.7 million inhabitants. Throughout the entire Paraopeba water basin, only 12% of the native forest remains. "Without vegetation on its banks, the reservoirs have a much more difficult time holding water since they suffer from erosion, pollution and silting," said Cristiane Mazzetti, a member of the Greenpeace Forest Campaign. "It's high time that our political leaders understood that, without the forest, there is no water."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot sun makes the thousands of cracks in the soil even more dramatic. After decades of being submerged, a bridge surfaces in the middle of the reservoir. The water that is left is concentrated at the bottom of the river channel. Way down at the bottom. At the moment, at the end of the rainy season in 2015, the Serra Azul is at around 9.10% of its capacity. In 2014, the average for the reservoir for the month of March was 44.3%. In other words, we are recording the lowest level in history for this reservoir for this time of the year. Our throats parched, we realized that we were witnessing an environmental collapse of enormous proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Serra Azul reservoir was the last stop on a six-day expedition to see some of the main reservoirs in Brazil's south-eastern region. Completed by Greenpeace at the beginning of April in partnership with the monitoring company Terra Sense, the objective of the expedition was to launch UAVs from different points along the reservoirs to record the level of water and the soil use of the surrounding areas. In all we traveled a thousand kilometers. We walked up hills, entered thickets, swampy plains and remote trails to access points that had been previously mapped as favourable for launching the UAV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="600" height="450" data="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157652279348729&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAVs, with their ability to capture aerial images precisely and quickly, make them an agile technological tool for research and other purposes. Without flying over any urban areas, our expedition was able to conduct 14 flights, with over four hours in the air, mapping 607 hectares in and around three reservoirs. Our efforts resulted in 668 photographs of the reservoirs and the surrounding area. When our expedition set off, we knew we would be the first to use UAV technology to monitor the state of reservoirs in Brazil. What we did not know was what we would witness with our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the Paraibuna reservoir, in Vale do Paraíba do Sul, at less than 5% of its capacity. This is at the end of the rainy season. In other words, it's not going to get any better. Just the opposite, the outlook for this year is frightening. During this same period last year (the beginning of April 2014), the Paraibuna was at 40% of its capacity. The Paraibuna, one of the most important for a system that supplies over eight million people in Rio de Janeiro, has less than 13% of the original forest in its water basin. Only 26% of its Permanent Preservation Areas, including hilltops and riversides, have been preserved. What one finds there is a lot of barren hillsides, pastures, silted riverbanks and, primarily in the region of the sources of the Paraibuna, in the upper Serra do Mar, rivers and springs that have run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Son, you see my cattle grazing over there? It was all water less than two years ago. Suddenly everything dried out," recalled Paulo Ribeiro da Silva, a milk producer who lives near the reservoir. Mr. da Silva explains that he grew up in the region and has never seen the water surface shrink this much. "If the government helped us to maintain the riverside forests and protect the springs, the situation would be different," he said. Even milk producers know that without the forest, there is no water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="A map of the Brazilian south-east" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg" alt="A map of the Brazilian south-east" width="600" height="609"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Paraíba do Sul basin the expedition traveled to the region that has become emblematic of the water crisis that affects the entire Brazilian south-east: the Cantareira System, the most important supply system for the largest metropolis in South America. Since mid-2014 pumping water from the so-called "dead volume," the Cantareira is a system of interlinked reservoirs that supply over five million people in Greater São Paulo. Or should we say supplied, since the state government has transferred part of that previously serviced by the Cantareira to other reservoirs in the wake of its collapse. From the edge of the reservoir or the top of the hills, we observed the Cantareira which is under capacity by 11% (without counting the "dead volume," which entered into use in May 2014). That's right, the level of the Cantareira stands at -11%. A year ago, this figure was around 14%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched the UAV from three different points at the Jaguari-Jacareí reservoir. For those who are concerned about the future of São Paulo, a warning: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/S0uUYiP1cLY"&gt;the images captured from above are dire.&lt;/a&gt; Only 15% of the forests of the basin are standing. Of the rivers that make up the basin, 76.5% are without their riparian forests. If the vegetation in the basin contributes to the water cycle on a regional scale and the riparian forests, in turn, protect rivers and springs from impacts like erosion and silting, our system is seriously degraded. "The economy of the region is already feeling the effects of the depletion of the reservoirs," said Marcelo Delduque, owner of the farm Fazenda Serrinha, located along the edge of the Jaguari-Jacareí. "A lot of people who depended on tourism and leisure activities have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0uUYiP1cLY?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the consequences of the water crisis go far beyond the economy. The collapse of the main reservoirs that supply the major cities of the south-east compromise the sustainability of the region, affecting the health, quality of life and survival of its population. The expedition increased the awareness that the south-east and other Brazilian regions have worked themselves into a corner and there is no magic solution. A fundamental step forward would be to stop deforestation now. "And begin to reforest, because this is the only way to recover the ability of the water basins to produce and store water," said Cristiane Mazzetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of millions of Brazilians depends on the recuperation of these reservoirs and on all of us to establish a new relationship with water resources and the forests. On a daily basis the Amazon releases 20 billion tons of water vapor into the atmosphere, forming flying rivers that flow to the south, south-east and mid-west regions of Brazil, irrigating fields and filling reservoirs. By continuing to deforest the Amazon and not recuperating the vegetation and the water basins that supply the country's major cities, Brazil is flirting with unprecedented socio-environmental disaster and compromising the future of new generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 1.1 million Brazilians have formed a movement to end deforestation in Brazil. We want to present the national congress with a bill that will prohibit new deforestation, protecting the forests that remain. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/amazon/"&gt;You can also join movement by signing the petition for Zero Deforestation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s officially spring in the Northern Hemisphere but nobody seems to have told the weather gods in Lesbos. As 50-knot gusts of wind thump the island from the south, at least they bring welcome warm air and time to put some thoughts to paper.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTX_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the prevailing north wind that raises our guard as it puts the Turkish beaches in the lee and gives refugees the wrong impression of sea conditions further out on their perilous journey. It's a colder wind that brought snow and countless cases of hypothermia in the past. Beware the northerlies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, Greenpeace is wrapping up its refugee rescue operation on the Greek island of Lesbos and handing over to Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) who are ready to take full charge of the operation for the longer term. The last few weeks have been quiet with only the odd refugee boat managing to break through the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ"&gt;new dictate from Brussels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen off the winter and should be proud of it. Nearly 100 Greenpeace staff and volunteers have donated their time, skill and energy over the past five months in a spirit that can only be described as "old school". MSF and Greenpeace have acted as one throughout, and much of the handover is in name only as many of the hardened crew continue their work under a different badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTV_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up the last few months is a tricky task – no two days have been the same. It's easiest explained in numbers, but numbers fail dismally in this crisis of humanity, especially with politicians and media banding them around like a currency on the stock exchange. Numbers fail to describe the pictures etched into our minds: an outstretched hand, a semiconscious gaze or even the reassuring nod from a colleague as life and death decisions unfold amidst hysterical screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTQ_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF and Greenpeace assisted 18,117 people at sea between November 28, 2015 and March 23, 2016 and conducted 361 operations on the north coast of Lesbos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main categories of refugee boats. Neither is fit for purpose. Inflatables carry up to 70 people and come in variable quality, occasionally with the glue still sticky. ‘Wooden boats' describe any type of boat that isn't a rubber duck, and these are the most dangerous: they tend to capsize and sink quickly when they take on too much water, or break up as they hit the shore. Both types of boat are filled with petrified souls, but when the term ‘wooden boat' rings out over the VHF radio it quickens the pulse and hand to the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPJNV_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team up on the hill (call signs Romeo &amp;amp; Juliette) perform a dizzying array of tasks, from spotting and guiding refugee boats to relaying information between officials and non-governmental agencies responding on water and land. Here's a glimpse of what goes on behind the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore – 171 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a calm day this can be a happy affair. When the people in boats realise we are friend not foe, the singing can start. After all the hardship endured (one can only imagine) they are about to make it! Smiles emerge as we exchange the thumbs up sign and cultural mediators and medics begin to assess the condition of the new arrivals from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the stretch of coastline we cover, there are about a dozen safe landing beaches. We know them well now and I no longer need to refer to GPS coordinates as I radio an estimated time of arrival to Romeo/Juliette: "send the medics to Yogi or Chapel" or "ground support required at Aphrodite or Sheep Farm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it's just a case of tweaking their course, as they are not accustomed to sailing. Before today, many had never seen the sea, so they are not to know that a lighthouse signifies danger – and lives have been lost on the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV9_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other kinds of assistance (such as solving an engine problem) – 141 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Check the fuel, check the fuel and check the fuel again" is the phrase I remember from the ‘Beginners Guide to Outboard Maintenance and Troubleshooting'. How true in this case. Outboards don't run for long if the air valve on the tank is closed, the choke is out and 10 people are sitting on the fuel line. The lucky ones break down after they have crossed the Greek/Turkish border where help awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not authorised to cross the red dotted line on the GPS that signifies the border, so unless there's a "mayday" case, boats here are left to the mercy of the Turkish coastguard (we have seen some shocking footage). And I very much doubt if the refugees  get a refund from the smugglers. Anything up to 3,000 euros is paid per person, making it the most expensive six-nautical mile journey on the planet. Anywhere else and you could charter your own helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dead boat in the water is also highly exposed to the weather. Waves lap over the sides and people stacked in the middle get soaked (usually the most vulnerable – children, women and elderly). Getting the engine going again quickly is the best solution. Our cultural mediators (many of whom were once refugees themselves) are now well versed in Outboard Troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV8_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore with towing – 24 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting fails but the boat is still in reasonable condition, towing is the best solution. But first we must secure permission of the Hellenic Coast Guard – we do not want to risk being accused of ‘people smuggling'. It's a complex political game out on the water! There are many players to navigate: the EU border agency Frontex has Norwegian, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Swedish boats out there. Add to that NATO warships, Spanish lifeguards and German, Greek and Dutch volunteer boats ... the Greek Coast Guard has the final say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the practicalities of towing a rubber boat. Most have no reliable anchor points and there's a danger that you can pull them apart at the seams. The solution we've found is to put a thick towrope down the middle of the boat and ask the stronger people on board to hold tight with their bare hands. You won't find this technique in any RYA Manual of Seamanship but then you won't find this situation either. It works pretty well and is quick to deploy with the help of our interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHU4_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass MOB (man overboard) / MOB / capsizing / swamped / evacuation / transfer – 25 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the statistic that haunts our dreams at night. On 25 occasions many lives would have been lost had we not been on the scene. As it was, a total of four people died during our operations. Each occasion was different and the statistic covers a wide range of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter occasions it may be a swamped inflatable with a broken engine, but that could mean the kids in the middle were up to their necks, babies being held precariously aloft and hypothermia and panic in equal measure. The transfer of people from their boat to ours was rarely a calm affair. We'd do a co-ordinated sandwich manoeuvre with our two boats and try to offload the kids and babies first. We soon realised that it was important to take some mothers too as there is not much you can do with a baby in each arm! Sometimes outright panic would engulf the boat and a mad scramble would ensue. Often a stern word was required to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other occasions brought medical emergencies. There is a limit to how much medical treatment can be done during a rescue although we did carry oxygen and medical supplies. On one occasion the MSF medic successfully resuscitated a baby that had been in the water and had stopped breathing. On another we lost a four-year-old boy to the elements. Many arrived in the first, second and third stages of hypothermia so we would pull space blankets from our pockets like magicians. We were usually only a few miles to the nearest port and a waiting MSF ambulance, so in most cases the best option was to scoop up shivering children and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPI1R_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst incident was on December 16. Shortly after being threatened with arrest from Frontex (we are not allowed to patrol) a wooden boat capsized and sank. A total of 85 men, women, children and babies were in the water. We were the first responders to arrive, within 20 minutes. It was a scene from the Titanic. Death hung in the air. The Greenpeace boats were magnificent. Our crew grabbed, hauled and wrestled folks on-board, but still we lost two people that day. The Frontex boat couldn't do much as their freeboard was too high – they put out ropes instead! They don't threaten us with arrest any more and these days often request our assistance. I pray we never get another day like that, for everyone on the water it was traumatic, a day we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all these rescues it's the faces that we remember. Our contact with the refugees is intense, but it is over quickly. We check their pulses and breathing but there is no time for names or life stories. What happens to them after we deliver them ashore is not in our hands … I wish I knew more. Even if they make it to Germany or Sweden or wherever they want to go, I'm quite sure that many will grow up with a phobia of the sea, or perhaps it just blends into the multitude of horrific experiences they have had and continue to endure. Most are Syrians running from hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally as we start the process of packing for the journey home I find myself staring at my passport. How fortunate I am to have a bit of paper that allows me to fly over these man-made frontiers. An accident of birthplace. I feel privileged to have been the first face of Europe to many and hopefully a friendly one. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/12/barack-obama.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/12/barack-obama.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; 
&lt;object width="430" height="242" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8117722&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=0&amp;amp;show_byline=0&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00ADEF&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate negotiations kick off</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-copenhagen-kickoff071109/</url><text>
	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="act"&gt;

	As Barack Obama announced the US position for the Climate talks in Copenhagen, we felt a bit of an anti-climax between the buzz and the actual numbers. Maybe a time portal opened and Obama is living in an alternate reality? 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama first went to Copenhagen to support Chicago for the Olympics. How about going for a win this time around?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China leading, the US lagging - that's not quite the impression spin doctors from the White House were hoping to give when they finally released their numbers on emission reduction. Who is saying "Yes we can" now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of baselines and shallow commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin doctors were hard at work after the announcement - presenting this as a game changer. If you listened only to the White House, you could easily believe that Obama single-handedly saved the climate while everyone else stood around on the sidelines. The truth is, these are the numbers of the Waxman-Markey bill, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/strongmessage"&gt;which is not and has never been enough&lt;/a&gt; to really combat the devastating effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US keeps hiding behind weak numbers, made to appear stronger by shifting the "baseline" date to which they're compared. A reduction of 17 percent of 2005 levels is really a reduction of four or five percent of 1990 levels, the base year all other developed countries are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using 2005 as a base year is the kind of cheap math trick we expect from the Bush administration, not from a President who was elected promising he was going to get us out of the climate crisis. Moving the goal posts to pretend you're scoring is a nice way to spin your speeches, but science doesn't work that way. We can't change the science - we have to change the politics, which is not the way Obama is going right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep global temperature increases below two degrees, developed countries have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from the base year 1990. Anything less, and we face catastrophic climate change. The target of 40 percent emission reduction on a baseline of 1990 for industrialised countries is taken from the International Panel on Climate Change's scenario. This is not a political target, it is the minimum needed to keep the global average temperature at a safe level. You can't negotiate with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good efforts, but try harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, China, part of the group of developing country (the ones the Obama administration keeps insisting they're waiting for) offered targets that actually mean something to avoid catastrophic climate change - a reduction of carbon emissions relative to economic growth by 40 to 45 percent by 2020 also with a base year of 2005, though &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/news/china-carbon-intensity"&gt; those numbers are still not enough&lt;/a&gt;. "Given the urgency and magnitude of the climate change crisis, China needs stronger measures to tackle climate change," said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace China. "This is a significant announcement at a very important point in time. But China could do more."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By taking on a 40-45 percent carbon intensity target, China will have to take considerable efforts to decouple its economic growth from the increase in its carbon emissions. However, given the urgency of climate change, this target is not likely to accelerate China's clean energy revolution as quickly as it should be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barack to the future &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major announcement was made last week: &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/president_obama_will_go_to_cop.html"&gt; Barack Obama is planning on attending the Copenhagen summit... on December 9th&lt;/a&gt;. Last time he &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-shows-up-in-copenhagen021009/"&gt; showed up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, it was also a bit early, but as he is getting closer to the right date, we're keeping our fingers crossed for third time lucky. Otherwise we might start to worry about a possible break in the space-time continuum which could explain why Obama seems to be confusing 2005 with 1990, December 9th with December 17th and Washington, DC with Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Royal State dinner is organised in Copenhagen on the 17th, and it'd be such a shame for Obama to miss it.  Many heads of State have announced they will come already, and it hardly makes sense for Obama to miss the party. The last one to announce his presence was Silvio Berlusconi, adding to the long list of heads of state who have proved they take the threat of climate change remotely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wanted: Climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this, it appears that the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/our_work/guide-to-climate-politics/"&gt; climate leaders are not where you expect them to be&lt;/a&gt;. Obama, who had brought hope last year, is bringing nothing but disappointment in matters climatic. In the developed countries group, the EU has the best position, but it's still not enough. To find anyone leading the way, we have to look towards developing countries like Brazil, China, India, South Africa or Indonesia - or even better, towards the Maldives, the only country so far to pledge to go truly carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in the Obama camp now. Time to rise up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.

        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Facebook update: Switch to renewable energy now</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/facebook-dump-coal190210/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greening Facebook from within&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Facebook recently announced it will build a massive data centre in Oregon, U.S., packed full of the latest energy efficient computers to serve the hundreds of millions of friends connecting on their near-addictive social networking website. But the company plans to run the place on electricity made by burning coal--Yes, the dirtiest source of energy and largest single source of global warming pollution in the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Facebook.com shouldn't run on coal. Facebook should commit to renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should be run on 100 percent renewable energy. That clear demand started spreading &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coalfacebook"&gt;on the social network&lt;/a&gt; website this week, and will grow until the company announces a decision to really go green. The new data centre won't be ready until 2011, and people power has moved the company before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Facebook members have spoken strongly in the past on privacy and other changes that impact their profile pages, the company has been forced to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping coal from powering your profile page, big electricity consumers like Facebook can also play an important role by using its influence to demand policies that dramatically increase the supply of renewable electricity being put on the grid, so we can all use renewable energy--and not coal--to power the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook's relationship to coal: "It's not complicated"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PacifiCorp is the power company which Facebook chose to supply their new US$ 180 million data centre in Prineville, Oregon. &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.pacificorp.com/es/thermal.html" target="_new"&gt;PacifiCorp's website&lt;/a&gt;, over 83 percent of the utility's generation capabilities come from coal, geothermal, and natural gas resources.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; Pacific Power, whose parent company is PacifiCorp, gets almost 60 percent of its energy from burning coal.  Facebook also went to a state, Oregon, with only one existing in-state coal plant (that's shutting down within the decade) and instead decided to throw its lot with a utility that imports dirty coal from Wyoming, two states over.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Facebook says that the new building and all the technology within it will be state of the art, energy efficient stuff. Saving energy makes good business sense, and it's good for the environment too. But data centres still consume massive amounts of energy to run computers, backup power, and related cooling equipment. If Facebook's data centre runs on fossil fuels, then it's contributing to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should commit to stop using coal and choose renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. What's more, to be a climate leader Facebook should also push for strong clean energy and climate policies in the U.S. and globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which side are you on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data centres are heavy users of electricity. It's been a while since Facebook was run on a small computer in a Harvard University dorm. As the popularity of facebook.com continues to grow, so too will Facebook's need for more data centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies who run their data centres on energy from burning coal are supporting &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/"&gt; the biggest source of man made CO2 emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Our activists will continue to protest against coal-fired power plants. But getting companies like Facebook to switch to renewables is necessary for the energy revolution too -- reducing demand for coal, and investing in a green future instead.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists set up home on the Happy Ranger</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/happy-ranger-nuke-protest161109/</url><text>
	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/8/greenpeace-s-parody-of-the-log.gif" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Parody of the logo of French nuclear fuel company, Areva, manufacturer of the steam generators aboard the Happy Ranger.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

	Our activists at the Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia have had an tough time lately. Many of them have been arrested, interrogated and deported - along with independent journalists. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Climate polluter gets suspended on the Kampar Peninsula 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point police even tried to shut down the entire camp. Yet thanks to local support, our camp continues, in the heart of the rainforest, with the spirit and resolve of those remaining now stronger than ever as we celebrate a first positive step resulting from our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Ministry of Forestry has suspended the operation of Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL) on the Kampar Peninsula- pending an investigation into their permits. &lt;a id="lg:w" title="This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. And as local authorities do their best to silence us we're witnessing adramatic growth in both local and international support to protect forests for the climate in Indonesia - and across the globe &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/18/AR2009111804162_2.html?sid=ST2009111804211"&gt; Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CA8QFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F93fbcc6e-d467-11de-a935-00144feabdc0.html&amp;amp;ei=r1kFS5TiKt6TjAeTtJC8Cw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEPQqb_lclJBLo0Nj5JTKdlEisBCg&amp;amp;sig2=mpO8ZC6yVXD5KWueKZpWyQ"&gt; Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1940544,00.html"&gt; TIME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/11/indonesia-deports-palm-oil-activists-journalists.php"&gt; Treehugger&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action to defend the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="nbz_" title="50 brave activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;50 activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; - and as a result many were arrested, intensively interrogated and 11 foreigners were deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the Indonesian police gave the camp an eviction order. After a 24 hour reprieve, secured by our team on the ground, 300 members of the local community arrived at the camp to show us their overwhelming support - forcing the Chief of Police to reverse his decision to close us down. &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/here_is_an_update_from.html"&gt; Our Deputy Program Director, Sarah Burton, was at the camp&lt;/a&gt; to express our global commitment to stop deforestation and thank the local community members for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the police have arrested, detained and deported two more campaigners from Italy and Belgium and two journalists who were on their way to the camp with us from India and Italy. But the local community have demonstrated their support once again and our camp remains active thanks to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;National support culminates in Jakarta rally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a id="me-q" title="more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/en/news/callsby-climateaction"&gt;more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. They unfolded a banner reading, "Stop talking, start acting - save the forests for our future".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Pittsburgh G20 Summit earlier this year, President Yudhoyono made an international commitment to a 41 percent reduction in carbon emissions if this was supported with international money. This commitment also needs to be matched by developed countries making deep emissions cuts at home. And they need to support forested countries like Indonesia by committing to a fund to protect tropical forests. &lt;a id="v2kc" title="Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Worldwide support for forest protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the detainment and deportation of our Italian campaigner and an independent Italian journalist, Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs put out its strongest ever statement on the importance of tackling forest destruction, responsible for about a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions. That led to Italian supermarket chain, the Co-Op, writing toits suppliers demanding that they stop any dealings with companies linked to Indonesian rainforest destruction. Meanwhile - &lt;a href="http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/09_novembre_20/greenpeace_oranghi_berlusconi-1602036849795.shtml"&gt; in Rome an orangutan family of climate refugees sent a message to President Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; asking him to "Cut CO2 not forests". Back in Indonesia, our team unfurled a banner in a deforested area in Indonesia to send the same message to the President from the frontline of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.ch/index.php?id=1335"&gt;Switzerland - homeless orang-utans stole the show outside key Government ministries&lt;/a&gt;in the capital - they camped out in trees outside government buildings all night to bring the issue to the attention of the Swiss Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, was urged to seek a strong agreement in Copenhagen next month as wishes were placed in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeace_nederland/sets/72157622710110113/show/"&gt; thousands of shoes which were positioned in The Hague's center square by Dutch Greenpeace volunteers&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, children throughout The Netherlands leave shoes out for Sinterklaas (The Dutch version of Santa Claus) and expect something in return. This year - we're asking for a good deal in Copenhagen, including a forest fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;All roads lead to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, making it one of the roots of the climate crisis. We will only avert this crisis if Obama, Merkel, Sarkozy, Brown and other world leaders commit to much deeper cuts in emissions from fossil fuels and to provide the critical funds needed so that countries like Indonesia can end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they fail, we will face mass extinctions, floods, droughts and famine before the end of the century. The climate deal is expected to include a new scheme to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), which will provide the funds needed for nations such as Brazil and Indonesia to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a million hectares of forest, mostly tropical rainforest, are destroyed every month - that is an area of forest the size of a football pitch every two seconds. Indonesia has become the world's third largest climate polluter, after China and the US, since it emits such huge quantities of CO2 - mostly from forest and peatland destruction. The peatland forest on the Kampar Peninsula forms part of one of the largest natural carbon "sinks" in the world and is home to rare species including orangutan and the Sumatran tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up our Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia last month to bring urgent attention to the role that rainforest and peatland destruction play in driving dangerous climate change in the run-up to the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) and its main rival APRIL are key drivers of rainforest and peatland destruction on the Kampar Peninsula. We hope the Indonesian authorities stop intimidating peaceful protestors who are trying to help President Yudhoyono fulfill the commitment he has made to cut Indonesia's massive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions - and instead continue to investigate companies like APRIL that are destroying the forest and driving global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Industries pumping out poisonous substances day after day into rivers that entire communities rely on for their basic water needs - the reality of water pollution in China is one of the country's biggest tragedies. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/outflow-pipe-in-pearl-river-de.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/outflow-pipe-in-pearl-river-de.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace campaigner takes a waste water sample directly from the outflow pipe of the Qingyuan Top Dragon Textile company.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context even a seemingly small step by the Government to blacklist 20 factories in the Guangdong province for failing to meet water discharge standards, is of great significance. Three of the factories on the blacklist were amongst those found to be releasing hazardous chemicals as part of their wastewater discharge in our &lt;a title="poisoning the pearl" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Greenpeace collected and analysed samples of wastewater discharges and sediments from five industrial sites located throughout the Guangdong province that has the Pearl River running through it and is known as the "world's factory floor", accounting for nearly 30 percent of China's exports in 2007. The subsequent results of the sampling and analysis were released in a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/hazardous-chemical-pollution-o/"&gt; scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Warning for blacklisted companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the five factories that we sampled, three have been put on the government blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true extent of this pollution is still an unknown. A problem further exacerbated by inadequate water pollution regulation, allowing factories to discharge wastewaters containing complex cocktails of chemicals capable of causing serious damage to China's rivers and the life in and around them. Detailed report on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt; Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being blacklisted means greater scrutiny on these companies and their industrial discharges which could in the future translate to deadlines by the government for the companies to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/"&gt; stop polluting the Pearl River Delta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a warning to the factories and it may also affect the company's financial status in terms of ability to launch a stock market listing or apply for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;We welcome the decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government started publishing these lists in 2006 and the important thing to notice is that factories previously blacklisted have improved their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome both the list and the fact that three of the companies we highlighted to the government last year have been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those three companies are Qingyuan Top Dragon, Wing Fung P.C. Board, and Techwise Qingyuan Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;However a final note of caution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since China's pollution regulations focus largely on conventional pollutants and not toxic chemicals, Greenpeace is urging the government to urgently rework this legislation. The blacklisting is a positive first step, but to seriously combat pollution that causes cancer and sickness, China needs to start monitoring and eliminating hazardous chemical discharges into its rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;

            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Dr Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 12th, 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister Hatoyama,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your election has presented Japan with a-once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change. Internationally, your support for ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions has challenged the world to put our climate before corporate profits, the stance of a true leader. At home, your election commitment to build a strong economy and end corruption within the government has given you much support with the people of Japan, but also presents a hard road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us came to our new roles around the same time last year and I believe we have much common ground on which to build a new relationship between government and non-government organisations in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Greenpeace I worked for many years to end corruption in my home country of South Africa, to end poverty worldwide and to ensure that all human rights are respected. When our voices were in the minority, change was hard won. I can imagine that you must have felt the same, fighting to change the political landscape of a generation.  It is an incredible achievement to have turned the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accepted the role of International Executive Director at Greenpeace, because I believe that ensuring a green and peaceful planet is also a basic human right. For both of us, it is not enough to say we want change, we must ensure it happens and now we are both in a position to do so.  Turning the tide is not enough, a new  course must also be set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has operated in Japan for twenty years. In that time our actions stopped the dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan; we have worked with local communities to stop the expansion of US airbases that risked the habitat of the threatened dugong; developed long term working relationships with the technology industry in Japan to remove dangerous substances from products such as mobile phones and computers. We have contributed to government debates to ensure that corporations promoting genetically engineered food do not gain a foothold in Japan and we have not only raised concerns and debate about the nuclear threat in Japan, but assisted in monitoring for radiation following the 2007 fire at the Kashiwazaki nuclear reactor, after a major earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long, positive, peaceful history in your country. However, as a new member of Greenpeace, I can say that I suspect all we are recognised for is our opposition to whaling. Greenpeace in Japan and the Liberal Democratic Party have been at loggerheads on this one issue for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 15th in Aomori, the trial begins of Greenpeace Japan's senior executive Junichi Sato and his colleague Toru Suzuki, following their exposure of large scale corruption within the government whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has garnered a large amount of international attention and condemnation. More than a quarter of a million people sent emails requesting that the government investigate the allegations of corruption and not prosecute the activists. Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams have also signed on to a letter calling on Japan to adhere to strict international standards on human rights. Many international organisations including Transparency International and Amnesty International registered their concern about the manner of detention and prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, just last week, Greenpeace received notification that the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that, in pursuing the detention and prosecution of Junichi and Toru, the previous Administration in Japan had breached numerous articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are decisions made not on your watch. The many years of claim and counter claim were with another party. The United Nations ruling was against the decisions of the previous Administration. You were swept to power on a wave of hope because the people of Japan were tired of corruption. I believe in the same way that you have shown strength in challenging other governments to reach further in the climate negotiations, that you will also take the lead in showing other governments that the civil and political rights of its citizens are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is watching this trial, I urge you to show that it will both be fair and conducted in full accordance with you international obligations to protecting human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are rights that I have held in my heart since I was a child growing up in South Africa under Apartheid, and ones that I will always strive for, but in my new life at Greenpeace there is an equally compelling need to act to stop climate change and I believe we can also work together to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the biggest threat our planet and people face and demands immediate, dramatic action. I know that Japan can go even further if other nations will make similarly strong commitments and I welcome the chance to discuss how we can face this challenge together, and in particular exchange opinion on how Japan can continue to take a leadership role regarding climate finance. I also know that nuclear is not the answer - we have only to look at the dangers of the technology, the needless expense and most tangibly, the radiation leaks at Kashiwazaki after the earthquake to know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are solutions. Greenpeace has already mapped out and had accepted by scientists a plan for an Energy [R]evolution which outlines a global plan for a sustainable renewable economic future. It shows us how we can get from where we are now, to where we need to be to avoid a climate change disaster. It was developed with specialists from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Centre and more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that together we can forge a new relationship in Japan. That you will ensure human rights are respected and the environment protected and it is my strongest hope that the opportunities presented to both of us will be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/08be9eab86664205b6c2569cb5b36d0a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join Kumi. Tell the Japanese government that you stand beside Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;To preserve our independence, we don't take funds from governments or corporations. You are the reason we can do what we do.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Tokyo Two trial: Prosecution struggles on opening day</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/t2trial150210/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Worldwide support for the Tokyo Two&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It’s been almost two years since the wrongful arrest of Junichi and Toru for their roles in exposing the corruption and lies woven in the fabric that holds the whaling industry together. As the trial for those charges began, it seemed obvious to all in attendance that the case the prosecution put together is cut from the same cloth.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/greenpeace-activists-toru-suzu.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Tokyo Two on the opening day of the trial where whaling will also be judged in Aomori, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial opened up with the prosecution struggling to prove its own arguments and their witnesses being forced to agree with the defence on key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Japan maintains that whaling is conducted as "scientific research" and paid for with Japanese taxes, the everyday business of killing and processing whales falls to one commercial company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness from this company and from the courier company used to ferry the embezzled meat around the country  were in court to testify about what it looks like when whale meat and money change hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the story seemed to change quite a bit from original claims, one thing was for sure - it had nothing to do with research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not so "official" business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of sales for Kyodo Senpaku - the company contracted by the government's Institute for Cetacean Research, to run the whaling fleet - admitted under cross examination that "souvenirs" of whale meat were given to crew, but the cost was never accounted for in financial statements, despite the whaling programme being a government funded project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same official that previously made public statements where he insisted that there was no practice of giving out souvenir meat. He also admitted under oath that following the Greenpeace allegations in 2008, souvenirs are no longer given to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prosecution also called the manager of the Seino Transport courier company, which shipped the boxes of embezzled whale meat around Japan in April 2008 after the fleet returned from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. In his testimony he confirmed that he had paid the owner of the box about 30,000 yen (US$300) out of his own pocket, and never registered this payment. He also admitted that the owner had told him the box contained food and not the "cardboard" listed on the contents sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was madeby the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedythe shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will befair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it shouldre-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt; the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen hestood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Nowhe has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, byensuring that corruption is put on trial - rather than the honourablemen who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

	Since December there has been a glut of stories challenging the science of climate change as represented by the IPCC. Should we be concerned? Only about climate change.

            Arctic sea ice: still melting. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately there's been a rash of stories all ending with the word "gate" and all questioning the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the IPCC. Here's our handy guide to the truth behind the gates, but first -- why are they all called 'gate' anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Watergate" scandal of the early 1970s brought down US President Nixon, and was so named because it began with a break-in at the Watergate Hotel, Washington DC. After Nixon's resignation the conservative columnist and former Nixon speechwriter William Safire began attaching the word ''gate'' to all kinds of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactic worked, and pretty soon you could make anything sound like a scandal by adding the word "gate". Why did he do it? Partly to make his former boss's crimes look less serious and partly to make the small stories he was writing about look bigger than they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what's been going on in the last two months. The recipe is simple. Take a small story, add the word "gate", a dash of alarmism, and pinch of exaggeration and voila, instant scandal. Oh, and repeat as frequently as you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the breakdown on what's been happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Hackergate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate began with the release onto the internet of around one thousand e-mails and three thousand documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, home to some well respected climate scientists. With a thousand e-mails to choose from, a handful of sentences were selected to try and make the case that something dodgy was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video spells out quite nicely how much substance there was to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Himalayagate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate was followed by Himalayagate. In its Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, the IPCC reported that Himalayan Glaciers could be gone as soon as 2035. That claim turned out to be incorrect, and not to have been based on a scientific study. The IPCC subsequently withdrew the claim, it was an error, not a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean the glaciers aren't retreating, just that the rate of retreat isn't as high as the IPCC stated. On the graph below from the World Glacier Monitoring Service the red bars are years where, on average, the world's glaciers shrank, blue are years where they grew. Are the world's glaciers in trouble? It's an easy question. Is there more red or blue on the graph below?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/sum08.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24928/graph-showing-the-mean-annual.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Amazongate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Himalayagate we had Amazongate. Here the charge was that the footnote to the claim that 40% of the Amazon could die off was wrong. Not that the claim was wrong, just that the footnote was wrong. And it was. The report  the footnote pointed to didn't back up the claim directly itself. But  another scientific paper did [1]. Since then two more papers [2, 3] have confirmed the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's bad footnoting, but it's not bad science, and that's all there was to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The Mini Ice Age Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Northern Europe, or North East America you've had a cold start to 2010. And since that's where a lot of journalists live several of them have taken the opportunity to join up the collection of 'gates' with the cold weather to claim that there's a mini ice age coming. If that sounds a little hysterical to you, well, you'd be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story didn't really run in Australia though, because they're suffering from near record high summer temperatures. The West coast of Canada didn't pick it up either, because things are so warm that they're having to move snow by hand to make sure the Winter Olympics can go ahead as planned. Meanwhile in the high Arctic the weather seems warmer than usual. Indeed, it's the warm Arctic that's causing the current cold weather in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most newspapers provide their journalists with access to the internet. Why so few of them used it when compiling their 'mini ice age' stories is something we may never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;So what drives this debate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From reading the mainstream media, you might think there's a battle of opinion going on in the scientific community. Nothing could be further from the truth. The scientific consensus represented by the IPCC's reports is robust. Scientists who are sceptical about 'anthropogenic global warming' (AGW) are so thin on the ground, for instance, that the BBC's environmental analyst, Roger Harrabin, &lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/02/03/bbc-asks-wuwt-for-help/#more-15999"&gt; e-mailed a climate-denier blog&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February, for help in finding one! He wrote, "I am trying to talk to UK scientists in current academic posts who are sceptical about AGW. I'm struggling to find anyone..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inaccurate claim recently going around was that the IPCC's conclusion that coral reef degradation is linked to climate change was solely based on a report by Greenpeace. In fact, the IPCC's findings are solidly underpinned by peer-reviewed science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recurring story over the past 20 years of the IPCC. Attacks against the IPCC have originated from hired guns of the fossil fuel industry or disgruntled individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What this means for the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPCC scientific assessment is a rigorous and robust process, probably the biggest ever organised scientific endeavour, with thousands of scientists in many different research institutes around the world, backed up with masses of data. It is also a human endeavour and therefore not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment report in question is 3,000 pages long, and so far two years of effort by the world's denialists and journalists have found, well, one bad footnote. The story about the Himalayas was pointed out by a scientist - just the way it was supposed to be, and since we, like many others, relied on the IPCC report and repeated it we're now correcting it across our websites. If you spot any examples we've missed, &lt;a href="/international/en/about/contactus/"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has, and continues to have confidence in the IPCC. There is no more reliable guide to the world's climate science than the IPCC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7014203.ece"&gt; reported in the Times&lt;/a&gt; that the Executive Director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, has called for the resignation of the IPCC chair, Dr Rejendra Pachauri. His comments were taken from a much longer conversation with the Times journalist at a reception and do not reflect the full conversation. Greenpeace is not calling for Pachuari to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is clear, climate change is real, is happening now, and is caused by people. The solution is still in our hands, with clean energy, smart use of our power, and forest protection. If you want to be part of that solution, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt; become a climate defender today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>GUILTY! Japan's justice system "breached human rights of Greenpeace anti-whaling activists"</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/japan-guilty-whaling080210/</url><text>
	When two of our activists were detained after exposing major corruption in the Japanese whaling industry -- we knew the Japanese authorities breached internationally guaranteed human rights. Now, as these two activists prepare to take the stand and have their day, or more in court, the violation of their human rights has been confirmed by a UN working group.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/greenpeace-heeft-geprotesteerd.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Over 300,000 people have demanded justice for the Tokyo Two. Have you?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;"Tokyo Two"&lt;/a&gt;, are due to stand trial on February 15th -- charged for theft and trespass. But over the past two years it has become clear that &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/timeline/"&gt;much more is now under the legal spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. Corrupt government practices, censoring public information, Japan'sadherence to international law, freedom of speech and the right ofindividual protest together with the commercial killing of thousands of whales are all under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before the verdict has evenbeen rendered, a working group of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has already ruled that, in the defendants' attempts to expose a scandal in the public interest, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two/wgad-opinion"&gt;their human rights have been breached by the Japanese justice system&lt;/a&gt;. The Working Group's opinion is the first of its kind for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/End-whaling-NOW/"&gt;Take Action: Stand beside Junichi and Toru as co-defendants and show theJapanese government that it cannot silence the opposition to whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; February 12th, Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams, along with several top celebrties, have added their support for Junichi and Toru. And our Executive Director Kumi Naidoo has written &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt;an open letter to Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/the-japanese-whaling-ship-niss.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="151"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Junichi and Toru exposed a scandal involving government corruption entrenched within the tax-payer funded whaling industry. Their findings included the embezzlement of whale meat. The Tokyo District Prosecutor began an investigation but then shut it down the same day that &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;Junichi and Toru were arrested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were held for 26 days, 23 of them without charge - often tied to chairs while they were interrogated, without a lawyer present. They face up to ten years in jail for doing what any honorable citizen should do -- expose corruption. But it is not just Junichi and Toru's liberty that is at stake here -- it is the fundamental right to peacefully investigate and expose corruption, to challenge authority and to do so without fear of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their initial arrest in June 2008, more than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition to demand justice for the Tokyo Two, and legal experts including Supreme Court advocates worldwide have expressed concern about the prosecution. &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/tokyo-two-statement-of-concer/"&gt;International human rights and advocacy groups such as Amnesty International have questioned the legitimacy of the prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A hugely significant UN ruling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNHRC's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention informed the Japanese government in December that its treatment of Junichi and Toru breached no fewer than five articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The working group also recognised the following facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Sato and Suzuki acted considering that their actions were in the greater public interest as they sought to expose criminal embezzlement within the taxpayer-funded whaling industry."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Junichi and Toru willingly cooperated with the police and the Public Prosecutor but that this cooperation was not acknowledged."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The Government did not submit any essential information, such as details of Junichi ans Toru's activities as environmental activists, the investigation they carried out, the evidence they gathered or the help they gave to authorities to formally investigate their allegations."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time anyone has been found to be arbitrarily detained in Japan, so even before it has officially begun this case has become a landmark," said Dr Naidoo. "Prime Minister Hatoyama's government has shown itself to be a leader when it comes to climate change, now it is time for it to show its commitment to human rightsand ensure this case is remembered as a progressive turning point for justice in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;--&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt; Open letter to Prime Minister Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt; from Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr. Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Working Group concluded: "The right of these two environmental activists not to be arbitrarily deprived of their liberty; their rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to exercise legitimate activities, as well as their right to engage in peaceful activities without intimidation or harassment has not been respected by the Justice system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the Working Group found that the government has contravened articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also took the view that Sato and Suzuki had been denied the right to challenge their detention before an independent and impartial tribunal in fair proceedings, and requested that the remainder of the trial be conducted fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/greenpeace-staff-junichi-sato.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="244"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato (left), Toru Suzuki (right), and their leadcounsel, Yuichi Kaido (centre) face reporters at a press briefing following their first pre-trial hearing at Aomori District Court in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was made by the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedy the shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will be fair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it should re-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt;the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen he stood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Now he has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, by ensuring that corruption is put on trial -- rather than the honourable men who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

	The French nuclear industry seems to think it's fair to ship nuclear waste to Russia and then forget about it. They think that keeping the waste away from the French public will protect their glossy image. Not as long as Greenpeace is around.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists lock on to rails to stop nuclear waste.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night three teams of Greenpeace activists blocked a train transporting nuclear waste to Cherbourg, the heart of the French nuclear reprocessing industry. From Cherbourg it was due to be loaded onto the transport ship Kapitan Kuroptev, destination Russia. We've taken action to tell them that "Russia is not your dumping ground."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the railway, at two locations en route to the fuel reprocessing facility. A third team of Greenpeace activists placed a truck on the rails in the centre of Cherbourg, along with a banner saying "Russia is not a nuclear dumping ground". The train came to a halt just 50 meters short of our activists. For delaying the transport of the illegal nuclear waste they were taken into custody by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocked train was carrying 500 tonnes of depleted uranium, just a fraction of what has already been dumped in Russia. The French nuclear companies AREVA and EDF claim there is nothing wrong with these transports, that the material is not waste but a resource that will be processed in Russia, and returned to France as fuel. Unfortunately that's just not the case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog-s.greenpeace.fr/uploads/2010/01/nuke1.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="261"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, 33,000 tonnes of uranium have been exported to Russia (including 23,540 tonnes of depleted uranium), while only 3090 tonnes of uranium made the opposite trip. 30,000 tonnes of waste has been abandoned in Russia. This is in direct contradiction with both the French law and the European Union directive, which prohibits the export and import of hazardous wastes. If you read French there's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/france/presse/dossiers-documents/rapport-hctisn-france-russie.bin"&gt; a full report on this available here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this behavior sounds familiar, it should. AREVA is an expert in the business of running a dirty business and leaving the waste far away. Whether it's dumping uranium in Siberia or &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2009/11/areva_nuclear_scandal_greenpea.html"&gt; mining uranium in Niger&lt;/a&gt; they've made sure the problems of the nuclear industry are kept well away from France.&lt;/p&gt;

	The first milestone of the Copenhagen Accord came and went, and with it no sign of the kind of targets for cutting global warming pollution needed to steer the world off the path towards catastrophic climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists called "Climate Shame" on Heads of State in as they fail to deliver a Real Deal in Copenhagen
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the Copenhagen Accord could possibly be a useful political declaration was if its January 31st deadline had been met with tougher new greenhouse gas emission targets. After all, its stated goal is supposed to be to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But governments tried to greenwash their failure at the UN Copenhagen climate summit by merely repeating existing targets and dressing them up as action. So far, these targets will fail to hold global warming to below 3 degrees C; an increase which threatens to have horrendous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it take for politicians to realise that time is running out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Masks off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious to everyone - even those who tried hard to pretend the world was saved after Copenhagen - that the Accord is a document barely worth the paper it is written on. It was put together quickly by politicians hoping to pass for leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving face - that was its purpose. Our climate was the least of politicians' concerns then, and obviously still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, Bernhard Obermayr, Head of the Climate and Energy Campaign, Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe said, "Today is the day for an obituary about the Copenhagen Accord's ability to protect the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where we stand now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do governments avoid the 2 degree C threshold from being breached?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret. By 2020, industrialised nations must cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels and developing countries need to reduce their projected growth in emissions by 15-30%. Further, the industrialised world needs to provide developing countries with new and additional funding of at least USD 140 billion annually to support clean energy and other mitigation activities, forest protection and adaptation. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; To give this package teeth, it must be set in a legally binding agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to Copenhagen, 15 million people called for a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty. We're still waiting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Associating' - since the Accord is not legally binding and was noted but not adopted by the UN Conference, associated is the best they can do - with the Accord, the European Union repeated its target of a 20 percent emissions cut against 1990 levels - old news, and only half of what is required. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/emission-targets-us-china-021209/"&gt; The US is sticking by the meagre 17 percent of 2005 levels&lt;/a&gt; but making that dependent of domestic legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the absence of leadership by the rich industrialised world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the lowest-lying Pacific island nations last week said it's going to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2020. Lying only 2 meters above sea level, the Marshall Islands is in danger of being washed off the map. In other words, the industrialised world has been shamed for its inaction by one of the most vulnerable nations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting the "dead" in "deadline"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 31st was a political deadline. We are approaching other deadlines though; ones that nature decides on and which politicians will not be able to talk their way out of. If global warming gets to the point where 'tipping points' are passed there will be no way for us to backtrack and undo the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-third-degree/"&gt; While three degrees of warming would likely be catastrophic.&lt;/a&gt; But even 2 degrees C risks possible partial, but irreversible deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet and even the West Antarctic ice sheet, that could eventually lead to sea level rise of several meters. Half-of-one degree more could lead to 20-80% loss of the Amazon rainforest and countless species that live in the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg" alt="" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the poorest and those least responsible for causing the problem who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The fight for survival of millions of people around the world and countless species of plants and animals is the brutal reality as permafrost melts, sea levels rise, tropical storms batter continents and once-fertile lands battle with floods or drought. But climate change knows no borders - we will all feel its impacts. It threatens economies, environments, human society and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/changethefuture"&gt;The Amazon, the Marshall Islands, Arctic sea ice - we stand to lose so much. Tell world leaders what exactly YOU can't stand to lose.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our electronics campaigners are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/ces" target="_blank"&gt;blogging from the Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; (CES 2010) in Las Vegas January 7-10. Their mission: To cut through the greenwash, and highlight product ranges on the market which really are free of hazardous chemicals like PVC (vinyl) plastic and brominated flame retardants (BFR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CES is a major trade show where electronics companies come to demonstrate new products and jostle for industry media attention (which these days includes many technology blogs like &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;). Though it is not open to the public, CES say they expect over 140,000 attendees -- that's a lot of consumer electronics industry people in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first"&gt;In 2010, we should see significant developments, with products free of PVC and BFRs in the PC and TV markets. Any company failing to achieve this goal is taking a big gamble with its green reputation. On a positive note, it's good to see non-ranked companies beyond the PC and TV sectors, like Cisco, committing to eliminate these harmful &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics 14th Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; SonyEricsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; lead the way for product ranges free of the worsthazardous substances with &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/HP-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; HP&lt;/a&gt; following their lead. HP just released theCompaq 8000f Elite business desktop, its first completely PVC and BFRfree product, at CES 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/dell-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and LG Electronics (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;pick up penalty points in the Guide&lt;/a&gt; for failing to follow through on a promised phase-out of toxics in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies in our ranking guide had pledged to remove &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/" target="_blank"&gt;toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic and BFRs&lt;/a&gt; from their product range by the end of 2009, which would have meant a greater show of greener, toxic-free products for visitors to see at the CES. But, for now, it's a no show for these companies, who have delayed their phase-out to 2011 or beyond. No doubt they won't mention their backtracking to journalists and bloggers they meet at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's all the concern about toxic chemicals and e-waste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste and the wider community are exposed to significant health risks. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources, as routinely takes place in the backyards of China, India and much of the global South, can form dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumers want green, not greenwash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronics companies have been moving their "environmental information" links higher and higher on product information webpages in the four years since our first &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Green Electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is only greenwash though, and &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; informed consumers can tell the difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/news/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple cleared the final hurdle&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic, making it the first company to completely eliminate hazardous BFRs and PVC in its computer systems. Pressure from thousands of Apple lovers and advocates turned thecompany green in the time it took to go from iMac G5 (2006) to iMac Aluminum (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for a little less conversation and a lot more action on removing toxic chemicals." That's what our electronics campaigner, CaseyHarrell, is saying at CES. Apple, Sony Ericsson and Nokia are winning this game and HP is catching up, but the lack of action from other companies is ensuring that customers and the environment are still losing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ban the toxic stuff for good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies see their scores reduced in this edition of the Guide with the bar being raised on hazardous substances. Having endorsed the precautionary principle, companies now need to actively support bans on PVC, BFRs and chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs) during the revision of the European Union's &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electronics Directive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies need to support legislative bans to ensure a consistent phase out of PVC and BFRs across all electronic products," said Iza Kruszewska Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "Sony Ericsson and Apple are already calling on EU institutions to support such a ban. Other big players like HP and Dell, who have remained silent so far, and Acer need to ensure the ban is passed in the European Union parliament."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia leads the ranking, with a score of 7.3 out of 10. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; follows closely, and is the only company to score full marks on all the toxic chemicals criteria. In third place is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toshiba-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, but it risks losing points if it fails to meet its commitment to market new models of all its consumer electronics products that are free of PVC and BFRs by 1 April 2010. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; comes in fourth place, while Apple rises from ninth place to fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nintendo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; continues to languish at the bottom of theranking. Sony is rewarded for its reported 17 percent reduction ingreenhouse gas emissions over the period 2000-2008, with renewableenergy now accounting for 8 percent of the total energy purchasedglobally each year by the company, up from 2.5 percent a year ago. Italso gains for the reported use of 17,000 tons of recycled plasticsannually in various products, representing 10 percent of all plasticsused in the 2008 financial year. Almost 90 percent of this recycledplastic was post-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung twitter petition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung drops dramatically from second place to a tied seventh place for failing to eliminate BFRs in all its products by January 2010. With only its latest models of mobile phones free of toxic substances, it has set January 2011 as the deadline for eliminating them from new models of its notebooks and still has no definitive timeline for removing them from its TVs and household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Samsung's marketing people are touting their wares at CES, we'll be calling them out &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;on twitter with this petition&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;petition @Samsungtweets to follow Apple SonyEricsson and HP, and eliminate harmful chemicals like PVC &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;http://act.ly/1l1&lt;/a&gt; RT to sign #actly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The world's #1 sportswear brand, Nike, has accepted our Detox challenge: today it has officially committed to eliminating all hazardous chemicals across its entire supply chain, and the entire life-cycle of its products by 2020. This is a major win for our campaign to protect the planet’s precious water, and create a toxic-free future.

&lt;p&gt;Nike's announcement comes just five weeks into our&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/detox"&gt; Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which began when we launched the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;" report, revealing commercial links between major clothing brands - including Nike, Puma and Adidas - and suppliers responsible for releasing hazardous chemicals into Chinese rivers. We challenged these brands to champion a toxic-free future by committing to work with their suppliers and remove these toxic chemicals from their clothes and China's rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nike sets a new pace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma was first&lt;/a&gt; to break away from the pack, opening up an impressive lead by announcing that it would go toxic-free. Puma's commitment to remove all hazardous chemicals from its entire product-portfolio must have left their competition wondering how they were going to raise their game. Now, Nike and Puma are the front-runners, and Adidas is far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike also agreed (&lt;a href="http://www.nikebiz.com/media/pr/2011/08/17_zero_discharge.html" target="_blank"&gt;their full statement&lt;/a&gt;) to address the issue of the public's "right to know" by ensuring full transparency about the chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The more the public knows about the toxic chemicals spilling out of these factories, the more the pressure to stop them polluting will increase. The importance of this cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sportswear giant has also promised to use its influence, knowledge and experience to bring about widespread elimination of hazardous chemicals from the clothing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tonight projected messages including, “Water Pollution Is Not Fair Play” and "The World Needs More Champions. Is Adidas All In?" to the almost 100,000 fans attending the Spanish Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (sponsored by Adidas) at the Nou Camp Stadium, in Barcelona, Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can Adidas top that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to clean up its act, Nike is showing hints of greatness - but we will be closely monitoring the company’s implementation plan, due to be published by 18 October. And just because Nike’s taking the lead shouldn’t mean Adidas or other clothing companies can simply throw in the towel. The game is still on and they should be hot on Nike's heels to become champions of a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas have a lot of ground to make up. If they want to be considered contenders, they need to get in the game by committing to zero discharge and really take the lead by developing a new culture of transparency throughout the clothing industry and helping others stop the release of hazardous chemicals currently used during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's like Green My Apple again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind the Detox campaign comes from a year-long investigation into the textile industry's water pollution problem in China, where vital research helped us to connect the dots and link hazardous chemicals and their impacts in waterways like the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas to textile factories and international clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these brands, one group stood out as the most likely to become champions of a toxic-free future: Leading sports clothing companies like Nike and Adidas. Not only do they like to market themselves as leaders and innovators, they also have the size and influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate the use and release of these hazardous chemicals from the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="366" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkou6xAb6Rw" width="590"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enormous task of changing the toxic practices of an entire industry can be extremely daunting, so we went in search of a potential leader with the will to change itself and the influence to change others. Much as we did during &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;our Green My Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was vital to engage with innovative and proactive industry leaders - the sort of companies who are willing to put their slogans into action and &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that "impossible is nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much encouraging by Greenpeace and Apple aficionados, in March 2009 Apple become the first laptop maker to eliminate toxic poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). For now we have only commitments from Nike and Puma, though they are on the right track and deserve recognition for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bearing witness works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox campaign kicked off when our mysterious XM3N &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/xm3n-mannequins-reveal-their-mission-to-chall/blog/35757/"&gt;mannequins finally revealed their mission&lt;/a&gt; to clean up China's rivers. Their message was spread by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8OB68YeMmc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;our video&lt;/a&gt; – watched and shared by 100s of 1000s of Greenpeace supporters and sports lovers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people really started to get involved and the game was well and truly on. Actions from &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/es/noticias/Greenpeace-desafia-a-Adidas-y-Nike-a-liderar-un-futuro-libre-de-toxicos---/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/Nieuws_2011/Reusachtig-actie-T-shirt-aan-hoofdkantoor-Nike/" target="_blank"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/photosvideos/photos/Activistas-de-Greenpeace-cuelgan-los-trapos-sucios-de-Nike-y-Adidas-en-la-plaza-de-Callao-de-Madrid/"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; – including a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/hundreds-strip-to-challenge-nike-and-adidas-t/blog/35853/"&gt;world wide striptease&lt;/a&gt; – made sure the world’s biggest brands couldn’t ignore the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further pressure to perform was piled on by world’s media as the story ran far and wide, from New York to China and Brazil to the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/environmentalists-raise-awareness-with-coordinated-striptease-2326010.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. In Hong Kong&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our exhibit helped bring the message to the street where passers-by took a moment to put their demands for Detox in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people signed our petition to the CEOs of Nike and Adidas, many thousands of people have tweeted and shared the campaign on social networks and blogs, submitted logo designs, or contributed campaign ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Adidas have a tough act to follow, and everybody's watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What we're saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now stand at a 'climate crossroads'. We can go down the road of renewable energy and smart efficient use of energy, keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change or we can keep blundering on in the same direction into a fossil-fuelled future of extreme weather, drastic water shortages and desperate climate refugees. We cannot afford to take a wrong turn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this while phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear and without the use of unproven 'techno-fixes' like carbon capture and storage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Tara Buakamsri, Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our global energy concept means, that the investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a range of 300-350 billion dollars per year - almost equal to the amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To shift this money and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030, which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- SvenTeske, Greenpeace International climate and energy campaigner about the economic advantages of the energy [r]evolution scenario&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace climbers scuppered Tony Blair's nuclear announcement by delaying the UK Prime Minister's planned pro-nuclear speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference.

            The British Prime Minister gets a message from Greenpeace: no nukes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace climbers scaled the ceiling above the speaker'spodium holding banners saying 'nuclear - wrong answer' and thendropping down 'radioactive' confetti, preventing Blair from speaking inthe main gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech has been widely promoted by Blair'sspin doctors as being a vehicle for announcing a further energy review- and for Blair to indicate his personal support for more nuclear powerstations being built across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Tindale Director ofGreenpeace UK said, "Today Blair is trying to launch a new nuclear ageand we are here to stop him. Nuclear power is not the answer to climatechange - it's costly, dangerous and a terrorist target."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Justthree years ago Blair conducted the biggest energy review in 60 years -which concluded renewable energy and energy efficiency, not nuclear, isthe way forward. Today's new review is simply a smokescreen for pushinghis new-found enthusiasm for nuclear power. It's like Iraq all overagain Blair makes his mind up then tries to spin his decision to theBritish people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2005/11/nuclearwronganswer.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real solution to climate change and energysecurity is a mix of efficient, safe and clean energy technologies likewind, wave, and solar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded, "Nuclear power is simply adangerous red herring in this debate. Even if the UK replaced all 23 ofits operating reactors, we would only save 10 percent of our carbonemissions. In contrast the 56 billion pounds of tax-payers money beingused to fund the clean up of the UK's current nuclear sites could buyand install enough wind turbines to meet 20 percent of the UK'selectricity needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear power: wrong answer to climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclearpower has justifiably had a bad press in recent years. It's expensiveto the point of being uneconomic without massive government subsidies,produces dangerous radioactive wastes, and the consequences of aserious accident or terrorist attack on a nuclear plant could bedevastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry claims that nuclear reactors emit virtually no CO2 at the point of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delvea little deeper though, and the logic of this pro-nuclear argumentbegins to unravel. While it's true that most nuclear reactors do notemit carbon (although some nuclear plants actually do release CO2 gasbecause it is used for cooling), they are a small part of a nuclearfuel chain which most certainly does. The preparation of uranium forthe reactor involves a host of CO2 -emitting processes, including:mining and milling the ore; fuel enrichment and fuel-rod fabrication.Then there's the construction of the power station itself. At the otherend there's reactor decommissioning and the treatment, storage,transport and disposal of nuclear waste. All of this involves CO2emissions, which in some areas - such as fuel enrichment - aresignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this whole life-cycle is taken intoconsideration, the claim that nuclear power is a 'carbon-free'alternative to current fossil-fuelled power stations doesn't stand up.That's one of the reasons that the Kyoto treaty negotiations rejectedcarbon credits for nuclear power plants. The most recent studiesindicate that, for the richest uranium ores, CO2 emissions across thenuclear cycle are about 33 percent that of fossil-fuel plants. So farso good - but the fact is that very little uranium ore is of sufficientquality to produce such a result. Poor grades of ore have a content ofless than 0.02 percent uranium-235 (this is the uranium isotope whichis necessary to sustain the chain reaction in fuel in a nuclear powerplant). As the high grade ores are used up, the industry will becomeincreasingly dependent on lower grade ores - which will mean using moreand more energy to 'enrich' the level of uranium-235 in the fuel to alevel where it can be used in a reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Uranium is not a renewable resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knownuranium reserves will last for roughly 50 years at present consumptionrates, but the 438 plants operating world-wide produce only 16 percentof global requirements. If the world's entire electricity needs were tobe met by nuclear power, then reserves of high-grade uranium ore wouldbe used up within three to four years. Some estimates predict thatusing the remaining poorer ores in nuclear reactors could produce moreCO2 emissions than burning fossil fuels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a seriouslong-term energy source, nuclear power is a non-starter. But it haspowerful vested interests behind it which are sucking up funding thatwould be better spent on renewable solutions and energy conservation.As in the 1950s when the first generation of nuclear plants wereconceived, governments seem mesmerized by the glamour of nuclear power,and blinded to its obvious drawbacks. Any attempt to positionmainstream nuclear production as a solution to climate change would bea massive miscalculation, just at the time when we need to focus allour attention on the real solutions - energy conservation and renewablesources like wind, tidal and solar.&lt;/p&gt;

            Toxics Action Delivering E-Waste to Wipro 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of India's relatively small PC manufacturing companies, &lt;a href="http://www.wipro.com/corporate/media/newsdetail.aspx?id=1562" target="_blank"&gt;Wipro, has beaten giants like Dell, Samsung and Lenovo to the finish line&lt;/a&gt; in producing a computer free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major first in India, the announcement marks another success for our green electronics campaign in driving tech companies around the world to clean up their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new computer, named "Greenware" is free of both hazardous PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and BFRs (brominated flame retardants). This meets a long-time demand of Greenpeace. Since 2005, we have been encouraging a greener electronics race by ranking company performance. Wipro joins companies like &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Apple, HP and Nokia who are leading the way on eliminating toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.  Years of pressure from Greenpeace, and attention to our ranking from green consumers, are driving more and more companies to clean up their act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 is the year many electronics companies pledged to remove toxic chemicals like PVC and BFRs. Those that took this pledge seriously are now delivering. Other companies that are far bigger than Wipro in the global market -- such as Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung -- are failing to come up with the green goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our latest ranking, Samsung lost points for failing to give a clear timeline for removing toxic chemicals, as did Dell and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;E-waste in Asia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste are exposed to significant health risks, as are nearby communities. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources can form dangerous dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic waste is a particular concern in Asia, as a lot of the waste produced in developed countries ends up there for crude recycling, though a better word for it would probably be "dumping." Poor regulations and control enable a traffic that is essentially illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste exposes unprotected workers, many of them children, to toxic chemicals. It is time for all tech companies to follow the example set by Wipro and other leaders and produce electronics free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	Levi Strauss &amp; Co. today committed to go toxic-free. Why? Because you and hundreds of thousands of other people demanded that Levi’s “Go Forth and Detox”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox"&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" alt="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest denim brand joins ten other clothing companies that have made &lt;a href="/detox"&gt;credible commitments to Detox&lt;/a&gt;, including the world's largest fashion retailer, Zara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi's commitment comes just eight days after we launched our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Toxics-reports/Toxic-Threads-Under-Wraps/"&gt;“Toxic Threads: Under Wraps” report&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, and screened a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/because-we-fight-for-life/blog/43359/"&gt;documentary about a family&lt;/a&gt; struggling to hold factories in the region to account for the pollution they are causing, including suppliers of brands like Levi's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is living up to its claims of being a leader. Competitors that have so far failed to take responsibility for the pollution created along their entire supply chain are looking increasingly exposed. These include familiar big brands names such as Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A change of direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href="http://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Levi-Greenpeace-Detox-Solution-Commitment.pdf"&gt;commitment from Levi's&lt;/a&gt; is great news for people power and the environment. Levi's will begin requiring its largest suppliers (each with multiple facilities) in China, Mexico and elsewhere in the Global South to disclose pollution data as early as the end of June 2013. This means that's those living near all these facilities gain crucial access to information about discharges into their local environment – a basic right that up to this stage they had been denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than use hazardous chemicals in the first place, Levi's will look for non-hazardous alternatives. This is a bold move away from its previous position, which was focused on managing rather than eliminating hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition, the company has embraced the precautionary principle, which will be fundamental to shift the entire industry towards the adoption of non-hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toxic-free fashion is a trend to last the seasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 people have joined the Detox campaign since we re-launched in November, demanding toxic-free fashion and clean water. Fashionistas, activists, designers and bloggers took action on Twitter and Weibo, spreading news about the industry's toxic addiction and reaching many millions of friends and followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/buzz-screenshot.png" title="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted"&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl04_Image1" title="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/buzz-screenshot.png" alt="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Zara committed to Detox, then Mango and Esprit, as people around the world made their voices heard. Levi's was next on the shopping list, and in just eight days hundreds of thousands of people had called on the brand to match its bold proclamations with real actions. Activists and volunteers also took to the street in over 20 countries to take the message directly to the brand's customers and to speak with the staff working in their stores, who sent the message back to Levi's HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x173k1cRSzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has again shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while 11 top brands have now committed to Detox, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help spur on the next success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know brands like Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret monitor social media as closely as they monitor traditional media, and every time you like, share, comment on, or promote this video, it increases the pressure on these companies to change their ways: to stop poisoning rivers in the countries where their products are made, and stop shipping hazardous chemicals all over the world in their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A toxic-free world is possible. Together we can help create it.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>People! Zara commits to go toxic-free</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Zara-commits-to-go-toxic-free/</url><text>
	Zara, the world’s largest clothing retailer, today announced a commitment to go toxic-free following nine days of intense public pressure. This win belongs to the fashion-lovers, activists, bloggers and denizens of social media. This is people power in action.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers dressed as 'revolting mannequins' at Zara stores around the world on Saturday.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigners began a dialogue with Zara (a brand within the Inditex group) in 2011 about eliminating releases of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and clothes. But it wasn't until this week that the fast-fashion giant caught on to the urgent need to solve its toxic pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara has now committed to eliminate all discharge of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. And they're going to get rid of some of the worst chemicals, such as PFCs, even sooner. As a significant user of PFCs, Zara's commitment to eliminate this chemical group by the end of 2015 is a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox commitment announced today covers Zara and the seven other brands in the Inditex group: Pull &amp;amp; Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitment is good news for the environment, but also a breakthrough for the public's right to know what is being released into our waterways. Zara says that by the end of 2013 at least 100 of its suppliers in the Global South (including at least 40 in China) will publicly disclose data about their releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment. The open data will be chemical-by-chemical, facility-by-facility and at least year-by-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Climbers unfurled a giant banner at Zara's store and Swiss head office in Geneva, tweeting live from their phones to ZARA and supporters. 

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/the-toxic-tale-behind-your-clothing/blog/43044/"&gt;launched the Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt; globally with a fashion show and press conference in Beijing. Related images and comments began to rise like a spring tide on social networks within hours of the story breaking. Zara's Facebook Page quickly filled with comments from fans calling on the company to Detox. Thousands of people began to share their desire for “fashion without pollution!” and demands for Zara to Detox on Twitter and Sina Weibo, China's leading microblogging site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see who's commenting about the campaign &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/zara/Detox-ZARA-Social-Media-Buzz/"&gt;on Twitter and Weibo in one place&lt;/a&gt; – people around the world speaking out in a dozen languages to a combined reach of more than 7.1m followers. On Twitter alone there were at least 43,800 mentions of Zara and the Detox campaign this week. More than 300,000 people signed up to join the campaign to Detox Zara, and many tens of thousands of people emailed and tweeted directly to the company for an ambitious Detox commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- *** VIDEO *** --&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jWhLN0Ag_Dg" width="601" height="338" border="0" style="border:0px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/fashion-without-pollution-so-hot-right-now/blog/43128/"&gt;700 Greenpeace volunteers in 20 countries&lt;/a&gt; were out at Zara stores on Saturday. In the days before, climbers and other activists delivered the Detox message at Zara flagship stores and HQ buildings in Hong Kong, Budapest, Geneva, Hamburg and Madrid. Photos and videos of the actions have been trending on Twitter for days for searches like “Zara” and “Fashion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara's commitment to act more transparently is a milestone in the way clothing is manufactured. It's an important step in providing local communities, journalists and officials with the information they need to ensure that local water supplies are not turned into public sewers for industry. Zara's transparency revolution will be key to ensuring that as brands commit to Detox they then really follow through on achieving zero discharges by 2020. With so many businesses engaging in greenwashing, it's important for consumers to know who they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara now joins &lt;strong&gt;Nike, Adidas, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/Clickers-and-Stickers-Make-HM-Detox/"&gt;H&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/full-marks-for-marks-spencer/blog/42722/"&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/important-step-down-the-catwalk-to-toxic-free/blog/37928/"&gt;C&amp;amp;A and Li-Ning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; who have also committed to Detox but other top clothing companies still need to respond to the urgency of the situation and Detox. We tested &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/toxic-threads/"&gt;clothing items from 20 leading brands&lt;/a&gt; this year and found hazardous chemicals in them that break down in the environment to form toxic pollution. But by working with their suppliers and switching to non-hazardous alternatives, the clothing companies can become part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while Zara is a big fish, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation before our work will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fashion-lovers, activists, environmentalists, bloggers and celebrities will be back for more - toxic brands be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Here's how: &lt;/strong&gt;Watch, Like, and Share this animation aimed at getting the fashion industry to stop discharging hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Voila! Stop tar sands en Français</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tar-sands-france091009/</url><text>
	Our tar sands campaign just spread from Canada to France when 30 Greenpeace activists entered Total’s refinery site, in Normandy, to highlight the involvement of the French oil company with the climate-changing tar sands in Alberta. Activists unfurled one banner on a huge tank, and two others on the 75 meter-high chimney stacks of the site's power station. The banners read "climate crime" and "Total invests in sustainable destruction."
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/10/stoptarsands_france.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Total: "Our energy is your mess"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a global problem -- and this action is part of a global response to one of the worst climate offenders.  The world doesn't want Canada's dirty oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian "tourist" was also there participating in this action. Greenpeace activist Eryn Wheatley from Toronto was inside the Total refinery and occupying a large tank. She wanted to take a strong message across the Atlantic to Sarkozy and Europe -- that not all Canadian's support dirty oil, and real climate leaders shouldn't buy or fund tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not Canada's dirty secret anymore," said Eryn, from inside the Total site. "We're here today to expose an international climate crime. Sarkozy and other European leaders can't keep exporting the climate crisis to Canada. We need real leadership at Copenhagen and that means no more tar sands."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Totally criminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total S.A. has already invested more than 8 billion Euros in Alberta, and is planning to invest 10 billion more in the next decade, in Alberta and Madagascar, in order to step up its oil production from tar sands to 10 per cent of its global production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" id="ss189" width="430" height="400" bgcolor="#ffffff" align="middle" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" quality="high" flashvars="xmlfile=http://www.greenpeace.org/xml/canada/en/photos-and-video/latest/latestslideshows/stoptarsands_france&amp;amp;captionTextSize=10" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/resources/gcms/slideshow/ss189.swf"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning's action follows &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; three weeks of intense actions in Alberta. Activists from France, Brazil, Germany and Australia descended on Canada's tar sands to draw attention to what they are calling a "global climate crime."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STOP tars sands, GO to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If production increases as planned, annual tar sands emissions are expected to quadruple to 126 million tonnes by 2015. In order to avoid runaway climate change we need to be drastically reducing these kinds of emissions - not increasing them. The best chance we have is coming up at the end of this year when the UN Climate Summit will be held in Copenhagen. World leaders must attend this meeting and agree to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will drastically reduce our emissions and prohibit projects like the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;

	If you live in a developed country, you’re pretty well insulated from climate change. Shifts in weather patterns, heavier rainfall, gradually rising sea levels and temperature increases – at the moment western society absorbs these changes without us really noticing much difference. But for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, living on the front line of climate change, shifts in the planet’s behaviour are much more obvious.

            Nenet girl, Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nenet people of the Yamal peninsula are nomadic reindeer herders who live within the Arctic circle on the northern coast of Siberia. In summer they graze their herds on the tundra of the peninsula, and in winter as the ground freezes they move south to milder parts of the Siberian steppes. They use the frozen surface of the landscape to cross the numerous freshwater lakes and marshes of the peninsula, which in summer they catch fish in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things are changing. The Arctic is the most sensitive area of the planet to climate change. While global average temperature has risen by around 0.8 degrees, some parts of Siberia have warmed by as much as 5 or 6. And so the Nenet have noticed the ground is freezing later and later in the year - and in some places, not freezing at all. The reindeer herders have to wait longer and longer before they can move their animals south across frozen ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, on the frontiers of the world, the warming of Siberia is already threatening a way of life that has remained fairly constant for thousands of years. It's not only that the Nenet have to move later in the year - many of the freshwater lakes that dot the landscape are leaking away as the frozen walls of earth that contain the water melt, and collapse. And so the Nenet are also losing the fishing that provides one of their main sources of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/melting-permafrost-in-yamal-pe.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eternal ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siberia is a landscape that's underpinned by frozen ground, called 'permafrost', but this ground is beginning to thaw. Off the coast, whole islands made of permafrost are literally disappearing as the arctic sea washes away the rapidly melting land. Melting permafrost is causing roads, pipelines and foundations to collapse across the country. Every year, there's an increase in the area of ground that melts in summer and the area that doesn't refreeze in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem in the Arctic. This melt has global implications, because it's going to speed up climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permafrost is like a giant frozen compost heap - full of dead plants, animals, trees and other carbon-rich organic matter, and in places it reaches 1.5km (one mile) deep. While it stays frozen, that carbon is locked up in the ground. But as the Arctic warms and the permafrost thaws, microbes start to break down that organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9_Qn8UrxuE?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaming lakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - probably causing, tonne for tonne, around 25 times more global warming over a hundred years than carbon dioxide.  By lighting escaping methane, scientists can capture dramatic images of plumes of flame bubbling up through holes cut into Siberian lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are adding more and more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which is accelerating climate change. Permafrost contains massive amounts of carbon - probably about twice what's currently in the atmosphere, and about 5 times more than all the human-caused greenhouse gases we've released. While we don't have a really clear understanding of how much carbon might be released as the permafrost melts, it's fair to say that any extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from melting permafrost are bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/copy-of-nenet-girl-yamal-peni.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the melting permafrost, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. And so we need strong political action from world leaders at Copenhagen. We need to control the warming that's leading the Arctic to melt away. It's probably too late to stop climate change ending the Nenet's traditional way of life for good. But if we don't act now, that's going to be the case for pretty much everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

	We are thrilled to announce that one of our staff members, René Ngongo, has today been named a recipient of the 2009 Right Livelihood award.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rene Ngongo in Brussels 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo has been working closely with Greenpeace to save the Congo Basin Forests (the second largest tropical forest after the Amazon) since 2004, first in his capacity as head of OCEAN and now as Political Advisor for Greenpeace Africa when he led the opening of our first office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life story is an inspiring one. He grew up in Congo, near the Virunga National Park - a truly unique area with outstanding biodiversity which is included on &lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63"&gt;UNESCO's list of World Heritage in Danger&lt;/a&gt;. It was in these forests that he started to dream about becoming a Conservationist. He studied biology in the Kinsagani University where he also worked for several years. René also founded the highly-regarded Congolese NGO "OCEAN" (Organisationconcertée des écologistes et amis de la nature), which often served asa mediator between forest communities and key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the Congo Forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his work to protect the Congo Basin Forest from industrial loggers, René actively developed grassroots solutions and local contacts in remote villages. This infrastructure soon became the basis for educational activities on deforestation/reforestation and general environmental awareness building. Between 1994 and 2002, René developed tools to fight "slash and burn" agriculture. Among these tools were demonstration fields in Kisangani that showed local people possible alternative agricultural techniques. These allowed to diminish the pressure on the forests and provide better income alternatives to local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René coordinated the creation of a seedling plantation (20,000 seedlings) of the most exploited tree species in the Eastern province. This plantation provided trees for several 'green city' events. During these 'green city' (Ville Verte) events, trees were planted in abandoned parks, along avenues and in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of staying when you can leave is one of the most powerful things a person can do. During the brutal war that tore through Congo between 1996 and 2002, René didn't stop his efforts. He was one of luckier people who could have simply left the country, because of his network of friends outside Congo. Instead, he chose to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He monitored the use of natural resources by the different waring groups. During one of his 'green city' tree planting events on the outskirts of Kisangani, the war between Ugandan and Rwandan troops started. René and his invited guests had to search for cover from the artillery battle that suddenly started in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting against destructive logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that the DRC has returned to "relative" peace, more than ever, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/africa/problem/"&gt; the country's intact forests are threatened by large scale industrial projects such as logging&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a World Bank sponsored "reform" and a moratorium on new logging concessions that has been launched 7 years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMLYNmRc_I"&gt;companies continue to exploit the forest with impunity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly - if at all - paid and unequipped local control agents are unable to protect the massive old trees that are being logged and shipped to Europe and other international markets. But people like René continue the struggle against ecological destruction and social injustice. In his own words "Our forests are our livelihoods. They cannot be reduced to a cheap export commodity. For millions of people, the forests are their supermarket, their pharmacy, and the foundation of spiritual and physical health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Forests are also vital for our global climate&lt;/a&gt;. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from deforestation. In January 2009, the government concluded a legal review of 156 logging titles, and deemed 91 of them illegal. Despite this, some of the companies who have been not been validated continue logging today. Rene insists: "We have alternatives. We don't need to sell our forests for meager short term profits. We know today that our forests are worth more standing then logged, this is why we need a strong agreement and support for a global financial mechanism to reduce emissions and to end deforestation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Nobel Prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/"&gt;Right Livelihood Award&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the alternative Nobel Prize. It honours those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today. Several winners are announced every year and receive the prize in early December. We are beyond happy that Rene is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René's entire work is recgonised by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation today: "Since 1994,including through the civil war from 1996-2002, René Ngongo has engaged, at great personalrisk, in popular campaigning, political advocacy and practical initiatives to confront thedestroyers of the rainforest and help create the political conditions that could halt itsdestruction and bring about its conservation and sustainable use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the award, Greenpeace International Executive Director Gerd Leipold said: "While we hope President Obama turns his Nobel Peace Prize into real action for climate protection at this December's United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, it is people like Rene Ngongo who have already started the heavy lifting. People like René are the real climate leaders and it is good to know that at the very least one climate hero will be honored in Scandinavia this December."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Be part of Rene's life work: ask for protection of the forests for the sake of the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Naked message: global warming could mean an end to the days of wine... and rosés.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Parental warning: the story below contains nudity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

	Apple has stormed out of the biggest lobby group in the United States. At issue is the US Chamber of Commerce's use of funds to oppose climate change legislation. Apple has done the right thing, and IBM and Microsoft should think different too.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/greener-Apple.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Apple makes a stand for climate. Who will join them?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a murmuring of discontent within the Chamber over its lobbying against &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-critical-of-draft-s"&gt; US climate legislation&lt;/a&gt;. It has rapidly gathered pace over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson publicly stated their opposition to the Chamber's stance earlier this year. The energy company PG&amp;amp;E left, closely followed by Excelon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple took the most radical step so far, announcing on Monday it was leaving immediately because it did not support the Chamber's position on Climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who will be next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies with high-profile climate positions must be shifting a little uneasily in the boardroom right now. Staying silent on this issue is definitely not showing the leadership Apple and others have shown by speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coolit"&gt;Cool IT Challenge&lt;/a&gt; specifically calls on the IT industry leaders to show real climate leadership. &lt;a href="~/link/0f310e3ab69544948af86fa86ecccf59.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="~/link/097a1c87e2c04f7ea4812ee7cb3cb7e1.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; IBM&lt;/a&gt; sit on the &lt;a href="http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/all.htm"&gt;Chamber board&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, both have a financial interest in tough laws on emissions: they sell technologies and software which would be needed to cut emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for IBM and Microsoft to speak out against the position of the Chamber -- or do what Apple did, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisive moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might ask why is this a big deal? Many members of the Chamber have at least in words expressed support for legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they pay dues to the Chamber that uses this money to lobby for exactly the opposite. It's not a small amount either -- the Chamber spent US$488 million between 1998 to 2007 on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly object to the Chamber's recent comments opposing the EPA's effort to limit greenhouse gases... Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and it is frustrating to find the Chamber at odds with us in this effort... we have decided to end our membership &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of money buys a lot of influence in Washington's corridors of power. The Chamber hasn't been shy about its position either. In August it stated it wanted to put the science of climate change on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chamber &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/scienceandsociety/2009/10/green-apple-firm-is-latest-to-leave-us-chamber-of-commerce.html"&gt; questioned Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;' personal judgement in deciding to leave. Rather than lecturing Steve on innovation, the Chamber should be focussing the innovation needed to reduce emissions and the jobs this will create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the growing public spat between Apple and the Chamber we are definitely cheering for Steve. But he could do with some more heavyweight support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which other IT executives are going to match Apple's bold move? The stakes have never been higher for the climate. Apple's move will throw an uncomfortable spotlight on any company that stays on in the Chamber but doesn't act to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science says we need deep cuts in emissions and that means significant reductions in US emissions and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/copenhagen-greenpeace-demands/"&gt; a strong global deal in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December. The most progressive businesses know emissions cuts are inevitable and are gearing up to help lead the global economy to a prosperous, low-carbon future. The Chamber's current position represents the voices of the past that got us into the climate crisis. It is time the biggest US companies stepped up to consign this position to  the dustbin of history, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/10/climate_trashing_chamber_lashe.html"&gt; More on this story on our blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/4a75882fea2c4e36941400692ea057b0.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Sign our petition to Google, IBM and Microsoft to call out the US Chamber of Commerce for its opposition to climate change legislation, or follow Apple's lead and quit the lobby group altogether.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;The bottom line is: we can't stop runaway climate change without you. Whatever you can give today will help us ensure there's a decent planet left for us all tomorrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today we have good news from the Amazon. Four of the biggest players in the global cattle industry have joined forces to reduce their carbon hoofprint and back our call for zero deforestation. JBS-Friboi, Bertin, Minerva and Marfrig are going to stop buying cattle from newly deforested areas of the rainforest.

&lt;p&gt;The move is a direct result of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;', which we published less than 4 months ago. Since then, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies, including Adidas, Nike and Timberland worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan and committed to cancel contracts unless their products were guaranteed to be free from Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's announcement was made at an event in Sao Paulo, where each of the companies adopted new environmental and social standards to clean up their act and to ensure their products do not come from cattle raised in newly deforested areas of the rainforest. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Supermarkets (ABRAS), which includes Walmart and Carrefour, was at the announcement and supports the call for zero deforestation. Governor Blairo Maggi of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon and the largest cattle herd in Brazil was also there. Maggi announced that the state would support efforts to protect the Amazon and would provide high-resolution satellite images for monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making it work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures include the monitoring of supply chains and clear targets for the registration of farms that both directly and indirectly supply cattle as well as measures to end the purchase of cattle from indigenous and protected areas and from farms using slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country's leading carbon polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the United Nations General Assembly in September, President Lula announced a target of 80 percent reduction in deforestation by 2020 for Brazil. Deforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world's trains, planes and cars put together. A good climate deal will only be effective if it successfully tackles emissions from both fossil fuels and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 62 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil is ready and committed to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders to attend this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and there agree to an effective deal to avert the impending climate crisis. To keep global temperatures at safe levels, the deal must include the funds needed to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US $140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, so that developing countries can prevent and adapt to climate change. Approximately US $40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2015 in Brazil and Indonesia and by 2020 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>World leaders block Arctic coal shipment </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/</url><text>
	Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and other world leaders took non-violent direct action today against a coal mine in Svalbard, denouncing the fossil fuel that is powering the meltdown of the Arctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders know they need to quit coal to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now THAT's the kind of headline we want to see in newspapers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Obama, Merkel and their friends are not really in Svalbard. Activists, wearing face masks, are doing what world leaders should be doing: stopping coal, the single biggest man-made cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of world leaders, it was left to our activists once again to take action. We started blocking the conveyer belt of the Svea mine, which was bringing coal to the  transport ship &lt;em&gt;MV Pascha&lt;/em&gt;, early this morning. Activists stopped operations by occupying a loading crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 10AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists are being removed from the coal loading site by police now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked operations throughout the night in minus 15 temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're sending a message from one of the places most affected by climate change: a message of urgency to the real world leaders.Banners reading "Coal Climate Crime" and "Coal Powered Arctic Meltdown" are now hanging from the coal crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svea mine is located at 77 degrees North and is one of the closest mines to the North Pole. Coal is exported from here to Europe where it is used to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature outside is below freezing and polar bears are roaming around but our activists are determined to stay on the conveyer belt as long as they can - to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/22_activists_are_now_blocking.html"&gt;Check out the live feed of updates from Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal fired Arctic meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise has been in the Arctic since June, hosting top scientists to document the effects of climate change in the region. They have found that Greenland's glaciers are losing ice at an accelerated rate. In September, the Arctic sea ice reached the third lowest minimum extent on record. The Arctic is melting down faster than scientists have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea-level rise could impact the homes of one in ten people on the planet this century. This coal-fired madness must stop. Our Energy [R]evolution report presents a realistic scenario showing how we can phase out coal fired power plants by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: take action (for real this time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just 66 days, the countries of the world will come together to negotiate a new climate treaty. World leaders need to take real action by personally committing to attend the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and to delivering a fair, ambitious and binding deal to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/call4copenhagen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;We need real leaders at the UN climate summit this December in Copenhagen. Join the global call for them to personally attend the meeting and ensure a fair, ambitious and binding treaty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Sending a ship to the Arctic isn't cheap. We've only been able to do it with support from people like you. Take the opportunity to make a difference for tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama shows up in Copenhagen two months early</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-shows-up-in-copenhagen021009/</url><text>
	Our jaws hit the deck and we all fell out of our inflatables when we got word that Presidents Obama, Lula, Zapatero and Prime Minister Hatoyama were going to show up in Copenhagen. And then we found out that instead of showing up in Copenhagen for the UN Climate Summit in December, world leaders were actually going to be there today, 2 months ahead of schedule, to lobby the Olympic Congress for their cities to host the 2016 Games.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Acitivists make sure President Obama knows that his presence is required again in December at the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure the world leaders knew that their presence is required again in December, activists hung a huge reminder from the St Nicholas Church Tower reading "Obama: Right city, wrong date". The tower overlooks the church square where President Obama will be meeting with the Danish Prime Minister and Royal Family later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Olympic spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play is exactly what is missing from the current climate negotiations. Obama needs to help set a new pace in the climate negotiations, leading from the front instead of coasting at the back," said Jon Burgwald, Greenpeace Nordic climate campaigner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going for gold in December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to go for gold in December, and the big question is will Obama be a team player? Now that Obama, Lula and Zapatero all know where Copenhagen is they should have no problem making their way back in December, to lead the talks to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that averts a climate catastrophe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of state have to show up to the climate summit in December if we want a fair and binding climate deal. The promises that are on the table need to improve significantly, and that can not be done by delegations or environmental ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country in the world takes part in the Olympics, every country aims to win. No country will be free from unchecked climate change. Unless world leaders agree to avert climate chaos, we are looking at mass starvation, mass migration and mass extinction. Without the required leadership we will all be losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; - 26 activists have been arrested placing other banners around Copenhagen reminding the world leaders they need to come back to Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;The UN Summit in Copenhagen is less than 9 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate and show up to Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We will continue to fight to get world leaders to take responsibility and show up at the UN Summit in Copenhagen. We don't accept money from governments or corporations so we rely on support from individuals like you.

	Apple and Hewlett Packard get green points this month, as HP is rewarded in the latest edition of our Guide to Greener Electronics and Apple releases details of their greenhouse gas emissions. But the big points go to activist consumers for proving once again that public pressure creates positive change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When the gadgets we use go to Delhi for recycling, their toxic contents end up in acrid smoke.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; ranks the 18 top manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones, TVs and games consoles according to their policies and practice on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is published quarterly. We went to press before &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment" target="_blank"&gt;Apple's updated environmental information&lt;/a&gt; was published last week, but the welcome news of their transparency about greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental disclosures will be factored in to the next edition. Apple can justly pat itself on the back for listening to their customers who asked for greener gadgets. And all you Apple users should pat yourselves on the back for asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard had their penalty point lifted by putting a personal computer on the market that is virtually free of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/"&gt; PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, or vinyl plastic) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs)&lt;/a&gt;. Only the power supply unit and cable still contain these hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP back on track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP made a commitment in 2007 to have all PC products toxic-free in 2009, but went soft on that commitment earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we painted a protest on Hewlett-Packard's roof saying that HP stoodfor "Hazardous Products," and organized a phone-in protest with thevoice talents of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/breaking-green-promises" target="_blank"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;.With the new &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090915xa.html" target="_blank"&gt;HP ProBook 5310m notebook&lt;/a&gt;, HP has made the first step incatching up with Apple, which eliminated these materials from itsentire product line almost a year ago, and now puts pressure squarelyon HP's competitors to put more products on the market that are cleanerand safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; are still ahead on toxics removal, having eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, partly as a result of our "Green my Apple" campaign which brought consumer pressure to bear from people who loved their Macs, but really wished they came in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow learners: Dell and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and Lenovo each retain a penalty point for delaying their phase-out commitments indefinitely. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/acer-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will still achieve its target for eliminating PVC and BFRs in all products by the end of this year. Meanwhile Toshiba has a timeline to phase out these toxic substances from all its products by the end of March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top of the class: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Philips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; remains at the top of the ranking, with a score of 7.5 out of 10, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; with 6.9, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; with 6.5 and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; -- which leaps from 7th to 4th place -- with 5.9 points. The other climber is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sony-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt;, rising from 12th to 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow-footed: LGE, Fujitsu and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt; plummets from 4th to 11th position, weighed down by a penalty point for flip-flopping on its promise to get off the toxic sauce by the end of 2010 - now, only its mobile phones will be free of these PVC and BFRs by then, while phase-out in TVs and monitors has been delayed until 2012. At the bottom of the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fujitsu-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, with a score of 2.7, overtakes &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from 16th to second-last place with a score of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world needs climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition of the guide -- which also ranks companies on climate and energy criteria -- is released just two months before crucial climate change talks take place in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these powerful tech companies to stand by their claims and set examples of strong leadership for other industries to follow. It's encouraging that Philips, Acer and Samsung support the levels of greenhouse emissions cuts required to stem dangerous climate change. However industry giants like Apple, Nokia and Microsoft are failing to show climate leadership by making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take a quick survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=5uAfaHmYlBd_2fqhPFvjeTnQ_3d_3d"&gt;We'd like to ask you a few questions to help make our next hi-tech climate campaign a success. Got a minute? Please take the survey!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/supportus"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we couldn't hold companies like these to account. Be part of a greener future -- donate now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

	Yes, it’s true, we do indeed have scientists.  And some days, we even let them out of the lab. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Dr Paul Johnson
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days.  Our Greenpeace Chief Scientist, Dr Paul Johnston, has travelled from our international laboratory at the University of Exeter, UK to Ottawa, Canada to further our campaign to create a global network of marine reserves to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has worked with scientists ever since the organisation's founding days in the early seventies.  Recently, some of the world's best scientists have sailed on the Arctic Sunrise to monitor the growing threat to the Arctic region from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnston is attending the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Ottawa to stand up and defend the oceans. Greenpeace wants to see 40 percent of the world's oceans fully protected through a global network of marine reserves. We are aiming high with our 40 percent goal, as the &lt;a href="http://www.wdpa-marine.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;World Database on Marine Protection&lt;/a&gt; reports that currently, less than 1 percent is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1 percent, the majority of marine and coastal protected areas are situated within country Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), leaving the high seas devoid of protection. Even more startling, is the fact that only 12.8 percent of protected areas can be considered as true marine reserves, meaning closed to all extractive activities including fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the CBD put ink on paper, pledging to establish a global network of marine reserves by 2012. Five years later however, the pledge is still struggling to make it off the page and into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years we've been trying to help governments designate areas for protection -mapping it all out for them in the Roadmap to Recovery, launched at the CBD in Brazil in 2006.  Last year, the CBD adopted criteria to identify areas for protection, which were very similar to our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with two case studies on how marine reserves could work in the Pacific and Mediterranean, Dr Johnston will be giving advice on how to implement the criteria to identify areas for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships have been in action in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/bluefin_tuna_action_in_turkey.html"&gt; Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/voices_of_pacific_activists_te.html"&gt; Pacific&lt;/a&gt; this year - highlighting the need for protection, especially confronting overfishing of tuna stocks which are decreasing at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Dr Johnston will show in Ottawa, change can be made to protect our oceans. We have the solutions, we just need governments to hear us out and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently 160,761 supporters have helped us be heard and defend the oceans by signing our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt; Marine Reserves Petition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know what you buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species"&gt;If you're a fish consumer, check the red list before buying fish to make sure the fish has been sustainably fished. Tell your retailer if they don’t know where it came from, you don’t want it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists stop climate crime in the tar sands</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activists-stop-climate-crime-tar-sands/</url><text>
	What is soon to be bigger than England and account for more greenhouse gas emissions than the Czech Republic? The tar sands of northern Alberta, Canada - the largest energy project and the largest industrial project on the face of the planet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/this-is-what-unrestrained-foss.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/this-is-what-unrestrained-foss.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what unrestrained fossil fuel development and unchecked emissions looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning of September 15th 25 Greenpeace activists enteredthe Albian tar sands operation and proceeded to blockade themselves inthe cabs of two dumptrucks and one crane. They remained on the site for30 hours, successfully shutting down the entire operation and sending astrong message: the &lt;a title="tar sands" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tarsands"&gt;tar sands are a climate crime&lt;/a&gt; and they must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tar sands - sometimes referred to as oil sands - are one of thedirtiest sources of oil on the planet, and extracting thisunconventional oil resource has created a truly hellish landscape. Vastareas of wilderness are chewed up andreplaced by toxic lakes, open pit mines, refineries, andpipe lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting tar sands deposits is hugely energy intensive and produces emissions to the tune of &lt;strong&gt;100 million tonnes of carbon per day&lt;/strong&gt;. Worse, most deposits are located underneath boreal forestwhich must be completely destroyed to extract the tar sands whichfurther accelerates climate change. TheCanadian boreal forest is a huge carbon storehouse, and emissionsresulting from this deforestation have yet to be included in theofficial emissions. Not that the atmosphere cares about the officialnumbers. It is clear that tar sands development ispushing us towards catastrophic, runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate leaders don't buy tar sands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that world leaders still need to get the message. We will continue to expose the horror of the tar sands until they face the urgent facts and wean themselves off the brutal addiction to fossil fuels which threatens us all with catastrophic climate change," Mike Hudema, Climate Campaigner with &lt;a title="gp canada" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Canada&lt;/a&gt;, commented from the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the mining site, Greenpeace will continue to bear witness to the total devastation that is the tar sands. The message going into critical UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December is that climate leaders don't buy tar sands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="430" height="330" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockade coincided with the release of climate demands from the world's largest global investors - who issued a &lt;a title="statement" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for 'strong action this year from international policy makers in the fight against global warming.' Signed by 181 investors in total - this is the largest statement of its kind in history and shows that the future lies in a green, sustainable energy industry - not in the tar sands. It also makes clear the expectations investors have for world leaders this year. It was issued 80 days before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - which is the best chance the world has to agree to serious emissions cuts and strong climate policy that will avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's recently released 'Green Jobs' report shows that this green energy future is not only possible, but it is beneficial to jobs in the energy sector. It is the first ever jobs analysis of a clean energy scenario made on a global scale and is part of Greenpeace's &lt;a title="energy rev" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario. &lt;a title="working climate" href="/international/en/publications/reports/working-for-the-climate/"&gt;Working for the Climate&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that the shift to a renewable-energy based global system would be our best bet for environmental, energy and job security. By 2030 the report projects we could have &lt;strong&gt;8 million renewable and efficiency power sector workers&lt;/strong&gt;, while in contrast, if we continue with business as usual the energy sector would lose jobs - 500,000 of them by 2030. The choice is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A poster child for climate destruction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of the tar sands bring home exactly how devastating and destructive this energy project is for the environment. The toxic lakes created by water discharged from the extraction process are so vast they can be seen from space, and so toxic that cannons have to be regularly let off to scare away wildlife. This does not stop 11 million litres of leakage to occur per day. Even worse than what has already been done is the pace at which tar sands development is expected to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

The projections made are frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tar sands emissions are bigger than Estonia and Lithuania right now andin 2020 will be larger than countries like Belgium, Austria, Irelandand Denmark," explains Nikiforuk. These are daunting figures which make it all the more pressing that our world leaders take responsibility and act on climate change. They could learn a thing or two from the 25 activists that successfully shut down the Albian mine operations. One of the activists had this to say afterwards: "We look atour logo 'Stop the tar sands' which seemed so extreme a week ago - andnow it seems possible."&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you
couldstill see the occasional grand fig tree. Kids rushed up and
hugged us.I sensed that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the seeds for a safer life are already here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message to the Prime Minister&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;72% of the Turkish public wants Turkey to be nuclear-free.  Ask the Prime Minister to make it so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give peace a chance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us keep the Peace Embassy going and our activists around the world working for an end to the nuclear threat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have visited two of the major producers of toxic chemicals at
theirplants in Belgium to pressure them to produce safer chemicals
andsupport the inclusion of obligatory 'substitution principle' (EU
speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>SolarChill - saving lives using solar power</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/solarchillrefrigeration/</url><text>
	It's obvious we need solutions to climate change as well as real assistance to developing nations. SolarChill is a new ozone-layer friendly refrigeration technology running entirely on solar power, enabling the safe delivery of vaccines and food to regions of the world without electricity.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/solarchill.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/solarchill.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            SolarChill prototypes - the vaccine cooler and the refrigerator.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.solarchill.org/index.html"&gt;SolarChill&lt;/a&gt;
was born through separate discussions between Greenpeace,the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World
HealthOrganization. The big challenge: providing affordable
andenvironmentally safe refrigeration for the maintenance of
vaccines andmedicines, and the preservation of food, in parts of
the world thathave no electricity or have unreliable supplies of
electricity. At themoment refrigerators in developing countries
usually use kerosene,propane and to far lesser extent, solar power.
Vital medicine ismost often stored in unreliable kerosene
refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kerosene and vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerosene refrigerators consume about 1 litre of kerosene daily.
Notonly do they emit unpleasant fumes, theyoccasionally catch fire,
they need to be regularly fuelled up, andthey are often not
reliable for maintaining the required vaccinetemperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they are also environmentally harmful as the burning
ofkerosene contributes to global warming. There are approximately
100,000kerosene refrigerators in use today around the world for
coolingvaccines, which means they produce approximately between 73
and 91million kilograms of CO2 each year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What about solar power?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar Vaccine Coolers are already in use in parts of the world
thatlack electricity, and they have proven to be more reliable than
theirkerosene counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are only approximately 6,000 solar vaccine
coolersaround the world today. Two big problems: they rely on
batteries, whichare expensive and toxic to make and dispose of, and
they cost more than kerosene coolers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a solar cooler today is in the US$3500 to US$4500
range. Incomparison, the cost of the SolarChill package, cooler and
solar panelscombined, is projected to come in around US$1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The birth of SolarChill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, at about the same time as we were talking with
UNEP andWHO, the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) began the
development ofa new solar refrigerator that bypassed the use of
batteries. We decidedto join forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided the funds for the development of the first
SolarChillprototypes. These were exhibited at the World Summit on
SustainableDevelopment in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so special about these refrigerators?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="179950" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarChill refrigerators don't need batteries or a connection to
theelectrical grid - they store power in three 60W voltaic panels.
They dohowever have an AC/DC converter, which provides flexibility
to usewind, hydropower, bio-gas or grid energy (and even a
carbattery!) when there is not enough sun. The coolers are also
energy efficient because theyhave excellent insulation. They don't
contribute to globalwarming thanks to the special hydrocarbon
system made by our friends atDTI and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even maintaining a constant temperature, important where
medicine isconcerned, doesn't need an electronic controller - it is
managedthrough natural convection methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single SolarChill unit can serve a population of 50,000 people
forpreserving vaccines, and will be 50 - 60 percent cheaper than
currentsolar refrigerator models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Can I buy one for my new kitchen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet ... a second generation of prototypes of the SolarChill
VaccineCooler went into field testing at the beginning of 2004 in
Senegal,Indonesia and Cuba. 10 prototypes of the chest freezer
vaccine coolerare being tested under a variety of climatic
conditions, including atthe DTI laboratory in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans call for similar field testing of the upright freezer
SolarChill Food Refrigerator in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the technology will be made freely available
tomanufacturers around the world, so we hope that after that
SolarChillwill be available in both developing countries and your
localdepartment store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_126"&gt;Support our work to promote real solutions to help save human lives and the environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Hurricane devastation in the US, flash floods in Japan and a UK village washed into the sea. As climate change gathers pace, devastation caused by extreme weather is becoming more common. Take a visual tour of storm and flood destruction.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/8/local-resident-contemplates-th.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Local resident contemplates the roof of his home perched on a nearby tree after Hurricane Charley.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year the planet awes us with meteorological phenomena, like monsoons in Asia and hurricanes off the Americas. But however devastating these have been, there was at least some form of continuity and predictability in their seasonal appearances. Now it seems that predictability is a thing of the past, with cases of extreme weather on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Japan suffered from its third typhoon in three weeks. It is the fourth major storm to hit Japan since late August, and is reportedly the most powerful to hit Okinawa since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor harvests, caused by this summer's bad weather and flash floods, are having serious consequences for farmers in northern Europe. Entire fields have been left to rot due to the summer's heavy rainfall. Some countries have had their wettest summer months on record. In 2003, dry weather provided a bumper harvest, but the havoc caused by this year's torrential storms could also reach into 2005, thanks to seed and soil damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more scientists are indicating that climate change is to blame for these recent erratic weather patterns. The concentration of CO2 (the main greenhouse gas) in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34 percent above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="600" height="495" data="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="align" value="centre"&gt;
&lt;param name="quality" value="high"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report examing the impacts of Europe's changing climate. The report suggests that between 1975 and 2001, the annual number of flood events increased and that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years will see Europe experiencing more frequent and economically costly storms, floods, droughts and other extreme weather. While there will be wetter conditions in northern Europe, the south will have drier weather, threatening agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heat waves, pose a lethal threat to the elderly and frail, as occurred in the summer of 2003. Melting European glaciers are also an issue with EEA report estimating that three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps are likely to disappear by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hotting up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 ºC per decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, serious flooding in 11 countries killed around 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least US$15 billion. In the summer 2003 heat wave, western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30 percent. Melting reduced the mass of Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. Who knows what the economic and social costs of summer 2004 will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hurricanes too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's hurricane season has dramatically shown the danger of a world with increasingly extreme weather. Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances and now Ivan have made landfall in the Caribbean and Florida. In March, a hurricane hit the Brazilian coast - the first ever recorded in the South Atlantic. These storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and killed scores of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming larger and more damaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of global warming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans started heating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by while hurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet - gather strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that the Earth is getting hotter-and fast. The real question is will we slow the meltdown by curbing our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Stay away from ExxonMobil/Esso!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;ExxonMobil/Esso is the most active company in trying to kill any action on climate change. Exxon has secured court injunctions in several countries to keep us away from Exxon property. We're actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso properties! To make sure we're all clear about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away&lt;/a&gt;. Tell them you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are two more things you can do now:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The city of Ulsan, Korea has ordered us to vacate our "Whale Embassy" -- built near the site of a planned whale meat factory.  We've told them we'll be happy to leave, once they assure us they will not build the factory.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea ... with campaigner Jim Wickens on the phone as usual! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, we uncovered plans by the Korean government to
build awhale meat factory in Ulsan.  The discovery added togrowing
evidence that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea wants to reopen commercial whaling.&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We established our Whale Embassy to open a dialogue with local
peopleabout the government's plans, to explain just how many people
aroundthe world oppose whaling, to call for a cancellation of plans
to buildthe factory,  along with assurances that Korea will not bow
topressure from Japan to resume commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had visitors and volunteers from the local community, the
NewZealand Ambassador stopped by, and a great deal of local
pressattention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City officials embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But City officials are not at all happy with us tarnishing
theirreputation as the "City of whales" with our suggestion that
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ulsan isactually heading toward becoming the "City of whaling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Oureviction notice stated they want usto leave because they
claim we are in the way of the proposed Oceans Day ceremony on May
31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have given us until Monday, May 16th to get off the
site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stifling criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale campaigner Jim Wickens says: "It is quite clear that they
want tostifle any criticism of their plans to build the factory.
Today theyshowed us plans of the Oceans Day ceremony being planned,
and on theentire 15,000 square-metre site, they don't have any room
for ourlittle embassy.  We have told them that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;any attempts to evict usforcibly will reflect very badly on their international image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been several attempts at intimidation,
official andunofficial. According to Wickens: "Last night at four
in the morningfour local fishermen turned uplooking for trouble,
luckily there were others awake to come and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been tipped off that in Korea in &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;sensitive political protests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,thugs are often allowed to do the dirty work. There is a
possibilitythat this may take the form of fake fishermen coming to
beat us up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries has &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/"&gt;sent a
fax to ourheadquarters in Amsterdam claiming we are distorting the
truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Hygienic" butchering of "accidental" whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
They say that the whale meat factory will merely be a sanitary
measure-- a way to hygienically butcher the whales which are
"accidentally"killed by becoming entangled in nets, and those which
might be killedin a possible programme of "scientific whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea allows the commercial sale of whale meat fromaccidental
kills.  The Ministry didn't respond to our observationthat &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea and Japan individually in 2003 caught more whales byaccident than all the fishing fleets in the world combined reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor did they comment on the stories that local people have told
usabout some methods fisherman use to "accidentally" catch
whales:ramming them with the ship to cause massive internal
injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="137081" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With our own eyes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We witnessed the butchering of a juvenile minke whale which
was"accidentally" caught.  The whale meat was packaged up for sale
ata value of US$30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At prices like that, you can well imagine why a city official
might want to build a whale butchering factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who can stop the whale meat factory is Ulsan mayor, Mr.
Park Maeng-woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local businessmen, such as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;deputy vice president of Hyundai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, havebeen vocal supporters of the whale meat factory,
apparently unaware ofthe brand damage which other multinational
corporations have sufferedwhen they've been exposed as having a
close association to whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea hosts the International Whaling Commission meeting this
year inJune. The meeting that could open the doors to a return to
commercialwhaling, which has been banned since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tell the mayor to stop the whale factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're trying to warn Mr. Park Maeng-woo just how passionate
peoplearound the world are about saving whales -- how much his
town'sreputation, the reputation of Hyundai corporation, and the
reputationof his country are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1770&amp;amp;s=gen2"&gt;You
can help us let the Ulsan mayor know&lt;/a&gt; just how important it is
toGreenpeace supporters worldwide that he make the right decision
andcancel the whale meat factory. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Kids for Forests in action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kids-for-forests/</url><text>
	A lot of important politicians are currently doing a lot of talking about preserving the diversity of life on Earth at a global UN meeting. Unfortunately talking is just about the only thing they have been doing to preserve life on Earth for the last 12 years. Future generations will have to live with the consequences of current inaction. That is why kids from regions threatened with destructive logging are in Malaysia to speak truth to the bureaucrats.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A teenager from Cameroon (foreground) and a girl from Canada (background) at the UN Summit for Life on Earth (Convention on Biological Diversity.) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the world's ancient forests are being logged towards
oblivion. The culprits are logging companies, often acting
illegally, which are turning thousand-year-old forests into quick
profits. The members of our Kids for Forests Delegation see this
destruction of our shared future in their own regions. They have
come to Malaysia, to the meeting of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), to convince politicians to turn words into
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the delegates Omanie Sakespeso, 18 came all the way from
Papua New Guinea to plead with delegates to help save his home from
international logging companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." title="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56764"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
forest is my life and logging companies are taking my life away.
The creeks that we used for medicine are contaminated and our
burial sites have been destroyed by heavy bulldozers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omanie pleaded with the delegates: "You must carry out your duty
and protect my last remaining tropical rainforest. It is my first
time out of my country and I came all this way to tell you that you
need to take action now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Forests - furniture or a future?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last CBD in The Hague, 2002, delegates heard politicians
promise to stop the destruction of species worldwide by 2010. In
that time Kids for Forests have continued their campaign to elevate
the level of awareness among their peers on the issues of forest
destruction and ocean degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." title="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56761"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Clara
Buer, 21 from Germany who gave a speech in The Hague two years ago
is not impressed with the lack of action taken by the international
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Two years ago in The Hague I stood before you. Two years ago
you promised to stop the loss of life on earth. But in two years
nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am deeply disappointed, but I am back. Because young people
never give up fighting for their future and because I still believe
this place is the right place to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forests project" title="Kids for Forests project" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56749"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Your
promise is worth nothing, if you allow the ancient forests to be
boiled to paper or turned into furniture. Your promise is worth
nothing, if there isn't an outcry among you, when huge fleets of
ships take everything out of the oceans unregulated, undocumented
and illegally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kids for Forests youth delegation consists of around 30
young people between 13 and 20 years of age, coming from 13
countries around the world: from Australia/Pacific, Austria,
Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia,
Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Two to three young people from
each country are invited, accompanied by one Greenpeace
chaperon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clara ended her speech with a promise of action: "We are doing
our part. Now, it's your responsibility to set the course for a
global network of protected areas. And let the people affected,
especially indigenous people like Omanie, take part in the
decisions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Worth Fighting for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forest Project" title="Kids for Forest Project" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56758"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Kids
for Forests and Greenpeace are fighting for protected areas at the
CBD in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Protected areas are the backbone of
conserving life on Earth. It is widely agreed that, if we want to
halt that loss of countless plants and animals that are threatened
with extinction, we need an effective system of protected areas in
every country and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBD commits each nation to establish such a system. But this
goal has not been met: the system of protected areas is not
comprehensive, it does not represent enough of nature's biological
diversity and it is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want the governments to adopt a strong programme of work on
protected areas with strict targets, specific timelines and clearly
identified responsibilities. We want them to tell us who (which
country, which political institution) is doing what, by when, and
how they plan to establish a global network of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the demands of future generations, of children who
don't see the words "biodiversity" on a piece of paper but the
lives of the orang-utans, forest deer, monkeys, gorillas, and birds
that share their world -- and whose homes are threatened in exact
proportion to the threat to our own future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Who are we? Young people who want to change the world! What do we want? Renewable Energy! Make no mistake - the world is heading for climate disaster if we don't change our dirty energy ways soon. The young people of the Solar Generation project don't want to be living in a disaster of our making. They are campaigning now for the switch to clean renewable energy across the globe.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            15,000 postcards from the public calling for renewable energy are delivered in a ball of ice to the Bonn Renewables conference. While there was some progress at the conference it still left much to do to tackle global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people have the most to lose from global warming but also
the most to gain from the urgent action that is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts. Right now young people from around the
world are coming together under the Solar Generation banner to end
the inaction that brings global warming disasters closer and
closer. Henry is from China, where clean energy is a must for the
huge population. Abigail, from the Philippines, comes from a
community fighting a dirty coal power station on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now members of Solar Generation are facing possibly their
biggest challenge. Many of them are in Bonn, Germany for a major
political conference on renewable energy. Their challenge is to
bring the reality of global warming to politicians cosseted in
stuffy, plush conference rooms and help ensure the conference will
amount to more than just nice words about renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Abigail addressing renewables conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60915"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;They
made a start with the chance to make a speech to the first day of
the conference. Abigail addressed the delegates along with Henry
from China and Lisa from Germany:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With what we are experiencing, we, the members of Solar
Generation are putting our feet forward against climate change and
are pushing for renewable energy. Members from different countries
lobby to politicians, organize rallies and camps to increase public
awareness, participate in direct actions and support each other in
raising funds for renewable energy installations. We, the Solar
Generation, are doing what we can. Now is your duty to do what you
can!"(Read the &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/index.php/pages/DisplayPage?id=147"&gt;
full speech&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in China, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.hk/africa/News/Multimedia/photos/israeli-marine-forces-board-th/?campaign_id=32"&gt;
Henry&lt;/a&gt; has been busy with Solar Campus projects to spread the
word on renewable energy to students and lobbying Chinese energy
companies to invest in renewable power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that our actions and passion for our environment
could make waves in our world! We will spread our concerns on
climate change and take action to change the behaviour of power
companies, government and our universities, with the support and
spirit of more and more energetic youths!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if today's political masters rise to the
challenge of tomorrow's Solar Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Solar Generation in the following countries: &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.fr/solargeneration/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jugendsolarprojekt.ch/"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergynow.org/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finland resumes its destruction of old-growth forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finland-forests/</url><text>
	Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland.  The vast majority of Finland's valuable old-growth is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus.  Metsähallitus' logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value - including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            September, 2003, logging in Sami area
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being involved in a 'dialogue' process with two environmental organisations (WWF and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too - friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there's a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland's three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on customers of Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will entering their supply chain, pending comprehensive agreement on additional protection for these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin to switch all virgin fibre in their supply chain to sources that have been independently certified, at least to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On different continents in two very different communities, Paul and Ruby are battling Dow Chemical's refusal to take responsibility for its legacy of pollution, shady dealings and disregard for human life.  In Part 3 of our feature, we hear from Paul and Ruby as they strengthen their resolve to keep up the fight - wherever they are in the world.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The world is progressing at a new speed these days - but does anyone stop to think what sacrifices are made at the altar of this progress? We cannot even begin to estimate the many things that we have sacrificed in the name of progress; technology may have made our lives simpler, but the very same technology can be misused for destructive purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are focussed only on their profits, to the extent of being inhuman - and Union Carbide (now owned by Dow Chemical) is the prime example of these. In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my college in Bhopal, my friends and I spend most of our free time discussing the corporate crimes of Union Carbide in Bhopal. Most of my classmates are residents of other states, and knew very little about Bhopal before coming here. In fact, they only knew what the newspapers had told them about the Bhopal gas disaster. But I have related my story to them, and revealed the fact that the disaster was not an accident, but a premeditated acceptance of the 'risks' and a callous approach towards safety systems that 'cost too much' to be kept in operation. Once they have heard the full story, there is an almost unanimous understanding that none of us would ever want to work for a firm like this one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates and I recently attended a seminar on health problems of survivors. My classmates were very moved by this seminar, and offered to help out with putting up posters, inviting people to the subsequent programmes and generally spreading the word. In fact, they all told me that they were keen to help our campaign for justice in Bhopal whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, we were all sitting around and talking about our experience with this seminar, when someone came up with a brilliant suggestion - why not form a youth club to support the Bhopal campaign, and to oppose the work of irresponsible companies like Dow in other parts of the country! I knew this would prove to be a brilliant idea, because the power of youth joining our campaign would make a world of difference to the campaign. It will also ensure that the campaign gets another lease of life, with a new generation joining in to take it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read Paul's story, it seemed almost eerie - to think that he is going through almost the same kind of battle that our community is, and that too, because of the same company. His story and mine seem disturbingly similar. When I read his story, it seemed as if were both living in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's story also strengthened my resolve further - I am now convinced that the battle against Dow Chemicals needs to be fought on the global scale, and spread the word, involve more youngsters in the campaign, and fight them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely wish Paul and his community all the very best in their struggle. Maybe we can swap emails with ideas and tactics to help both our campaigns. While writing my own serial stories, and reading Paul's stories, I have realized the global nature of our campaign. I also feel like I have found a friend in Paul, learnt about his life, and presented our two different, yet similar stories to the millions of readers who log onto the Greenpeace website from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that in 20 years time, when we are both in our 40's we can reflect on the day Dow accepted its responsibilities and did the right thing in Bhopal and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Paul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since I found out Dow Chemical had quietly been polluting the area around my home for years I have been constantly amazed by this company. I have to give it credit for the amount of hard work and millions of dollars it spends in order to make the public believe it is a responsible company. Rather than tackle the pollution problems of its own making it does all it can to avoid this. Its story is the same be it here in the US or in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered Dow had polluted areas downstream of its [Michigan] plant with levels 9000 times the state clean up levels the Dow denial machine went into overdrive. First it denied it caused the pollution. Next it hired the best PR firms and lawyers and lobbied local politicians to ensure it didn't get the blame. Even so it was proved that Dow caused the pollution. Oops! So then it spends more money on PR, lawyers, and lobbying politicians to say dioxin is harmless. But test results prove levels are dangerously high. Dow now spends money on more PR, trying to spin the test results. It even tried but failed to get the state of Michigan to raise the clean up levels, in an attempt to instantly make the problem disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="297" height="119" align="right"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this denial, lobbying and muddying of these dirty waters costs Dow millions. Just imagine if it had owned up straight away and spent this cash on tackling the problem. That is what the affected communities and I are fighting for. We don't have millions of dollars or fancy lawyers but we have the most powerful weapon - the truth on our side. I am campaigning for a clean up of the river, and ideally medical monitoring of all contaminated individuals' health. Would it have been smart to admit to the dioxin contamination and clean up the problem at the outset, so saving Dow millions? Yes, for sure! I don't understand Dow's thinking, it must have some egotistical management that doesn't like to be proven wrong, maybe that is why they refuse to clean up the river. If only women ran Dow, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything Dow does is wrong and some people in the area have benefited from Dow's presence. But I firmly believe that Dow can make a profit without trashing the environment and harming peoples health. Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth and refuse to except law and moral responsibility for their business actions. Couldn't Dow just take one years profits and instead of giving it to lawyers, PR firms, politicians or shareholders, resolve the problems of its own making? That is all I ask and many others the world over would like to know. Is that a lot to ask for? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposing side will probably say, people like me don't understand business and just want to harm Dow. But it seems Dow can do this itself with poor judgments involving the use of its money. I am not trying to destroy businesses; I just feel a business should have some moral values, at least one moral value. A business shouldn't destroy the lives of others in order to make a few extra bucks. No person or company should do that. A company should respect its workers and their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby shouldn't have to wait 20 years or more for justice after the disaster in Bhopal. People in Michigan shouldn't have to fight against a company and the state in order to enforce state laws. People in government have obviously failed both the citizens of Bhopal and in Michigan, they bend over for Dow at any chance they get, thinking of only themselves. How many more people have to die in Bhopal in order for clean up and how many more silent and slow deaths caused by dioxin pollution do the citizens of Michigan have to face? Sadly enough for me and Ruby, it seems both of our countries value profits over precious life. One can make and create all the money he or she desires, but one can't recreate an aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, or mom and dad after they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In China, the world's largest food market, 32 food companies, producing 53 brands have agreed not to sell genetically engineered (GE) food. Although non-GE policy is already standard in many countries worldwide, this is the first time food producers have publicly committed to such a policy in China.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese consumers turn their backs on GE food. Greenpeace Food Safety Roadshow visit to Huaying green community in Guangzhou.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, consumers around the world do not want GE
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food companies in China are joining the ranks of a growing
number of non-GE companies worldwide. This is another blow to the
GE industry, which is already troubled by increasing market
rejection and is desperate to find new markets to dump its unwanted
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some well known brand names appear amongst the 32 food producers
promising not to use GE ingredients in products sold in China
including Lipton, Wrigley, Wyeth and Mead Johnson. These companies
have already been selling non-GE food in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sze Pang-cheung said "Transnational food
companies are learning the lesson. There is a heavy price to pay
for applying double standards to Chinese consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we revealed Nestle´s ruthless overseas practice of selling
GE food, including baby food, in China and other Asian countries,
the Swiss-based company´s "double standards" met with angry
reactions from Chinese consumers who returned products to
Nestle.&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=7624&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;&lt;br&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GE is unmistakably the growing trend in China. The majority
of consumers do not want GE foods, and the Chinese government is
taking consumer's rights to choose seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released China's first comprehensive survey of consumer
attitude to GE food in January this year. The survey showed that a
clear majority would choose GE-free food over GE food and many
would be willing to pay more for it. An overwhelming majority of 87
percent wanted GE food products to be labelled. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=111516&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, the Chinese government introduced compulsory
labelling of GE food. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/news/details?item_id=15856&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has stepped up measures to enforce the labelling
legislation by conducting a nationwide inspection. Agriculture
officials emphasised that producers selling unlabelled GE products
would be penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The choice for food producers is either to label their GE
products and face consumer rejection, or to risk violating the
regulation by covering up the true nature of their products," added
Sze. "Companies simply have to make the right decision for
consumers, the environment and their business interests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge more companies to follow suit to address consumers'
growing concerns about GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

            Elephants take Thai Buddhist monks to bless the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands.

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnaud Immele (Oenologist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Help protect French wine by asking world leaders to go to the UN Climate Summit in December and ensure a good deal for wine - and for the entire planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose
risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;Ask governments worldwide to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting GE Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments.

	A climate tipping point is looming closer every day in the Arctic. The more we find out about the Polar Regions, the more we realise that what we know about the impact of feedback effects has been underestimated. Recent discoveries highlight the need for action now, before it’s too late. 
&lt;div&gt;

            The settlement of Tasilaq in Greenland where the Arctic Sunrise stopped to re-supply.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subtropical currents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of independent scientists on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is investigating whether warming subtropical ocean currents are causing Greenland glaciers to melt faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the melt from warming temperatures is a known phenomenon, the influence of currents is less understood, and new research conducted by Dr Fiamma Straneo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution is groundbreaking.  (Or, perhaps, "icebreaking"?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over the last decade we've seen dramatic changes in the Greenland ice sheet; in particular there's been a large loss of mass of ice from Greenland's outlet glaciers. One of the mechanisms we think may have triggered these changes is the inflow of warm subtropical water inside of Greenland's glacial fjords," Dr Straneo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A (frozen) river runs through it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These currents could be causing the dramatic melt of Greenlandic glaciers. Dr Gordon Hamilton, of the University of Maine, has been studying the speed of flow of the Greenland glaciers, and in particular Helheim glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are like frozen rivers, with ice slowly moving downstream at an average of 50 meters per year. Helheim glacier is moving at the speed of 25 meters per DAY. Located further North, the Kangerdlugssuaq glacier moves at an average of &lt;em&gt;38 meters per day&lt;/em&gt;. This is opening the way for the Greenland ice sheet to flow out, melt in the Atlantic Ocean, and contribute to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is probably the world's fastest moving glacier. It tripled its speed between 2004 and 2005, which tells us the glacier is moving mass out of the middle of Greenland's ice sheet, in the form of icebergs, at a rate three times faster than just a few years ago. This has important implications for both the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the rate of global sea level rise," said Dr Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; &lt;object width="400" height="246" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/8U71a5QpEJs&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8U71a5QpEJs&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating feedback effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other feedback effects in the Arctic are highlighted in a new &lt;a href="http://panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/news/?173241/Warming-Arctics-global-impacts-outstrip-predictions"&gt; WWF report&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that  their influence on the global climate also may have been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic multi-year sea ice is increasingly replaced by younger sea ice, making the ice-cap more vulnerable to melting in the summer. This allows the surface water to absorb more heat. The permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is heating up as well, releasing underground methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This methane then further contributes to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report also points out that the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2007 estimates on sea-level rise were too optimistic, and offers new estimates of up to 1.2 meters by the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the IPCC reported an &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter5.pdf"&gt; estimated sea-level rise of 20 to 50 cm&lt;/a&gt;. As worrying as these figures were, evidence now suggest things are worse than they'd thought. The effect that the melting Greenland ice-sheet could have on sea-level rise was not fully included in the IPCC reports, since these findings are too recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we go beyond the tipping point where global warming feeds itself, there will be no going back. The time for action is now. In 95 days, the Copenhagen climate Conference will start. World leaders have to show their commitment to the climate by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;attending and adopting strong emissions targets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell global leaders to go to Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Mama Sarah Obama flicks on the lights  after a Solar power system was installed at her home in Kogelo Village, Kenya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a title="Solargen" href="/international/en/news/features/the-solar-generation/"&gt;Solar Generation&lt;/a&gt; Activists and local youth organisers installed the panels on "Mama Sara's" home, and also put panels on the Senator Barack Obama School in Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar installations are part of a 20 day renewable energy workshop hosted by Solar Generation with 25 participants from the Kibera Community Youth Programme and community members of Nyang'oma Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program helps young Kenyans learn how solar photovoltaic panels generate electricity, about their installation and maintenance and the fabrication of self-assembling solar lamps and their marketing potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what Mama Sarah had to say about the new solar panels on her house: "I am very pleased that my home has been improved thanks to solar energy and I'll make sure my grandson hears about it. Solar power is clean, reliable and affordable, unlike paraffin that is widely used in the area. Also, we now have qualified youth in the village who can help with the upkeep of the systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climate impacts reach Kenya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya, like many other countries in Africa, is on the climate impacts frontline. It has seen a drastic reduction in rainfall in recent years. Drought is amplifying problems in agriculture caused by poor land use and desertification, making Kenya's large scale hydro power unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, investing in solar energy technologies is a win-win strategy. It strengthens the economy and protects the environment, while ensuring a reliable and clean energy supply. The solar industry is ready and able to deliver the needed capacity. There is no technical impediment to doing this, just a political barrier to overcome as we rebuild the global energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes you can too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 108 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Leather industry giant moves to end Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bertin140809/</url><text>
	Bertin, the world’s largest leather exporter is joining the fight against deforestation and climate change and is finally doing the right thing and backing the call for a moratorium on buying cattle from farms responsible for Amazon deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is currently the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/" target="_blank"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon'&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies Adidas, &lt;a title="Nike victory" href="/international/en/news/features/nike-amazon230709/"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Timberland, Clarks, Geox and Timberland have all committed not to buy leather from Amazon destruction, prompting the recent decision by Bertin to commit to stop sourcing cattle from newly deforested areas and implement a traceability system to ensure the sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, Bertin will register and map all farms which directly supply cattle to the company. For the rest of the supply chain, including rearing and nursery farms, it will implement a traceability system from farms to its slaughterhouses and processing facilities by 2011. They will also ensure that they don't buy cattle from indigenous and protected areas or from farms linked to slave labour, land conflicts and land grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertin's commitment to end Amazon deforestation comes soon after a similar announcement from Marfrig, one of the world's largest beef traders. It leaves Brazilian JBS-Friboi, the world's largest producer and global exporter of processed beef as the last major exporter that has failed to commit to help end the destruction of the Amazon.  Contrary to its competitors, JBS-Friboi is staying silent on the issue and is actually expanding into the Amazon, having rented several new facilities north of Mato Grosso State, an area which has the greatest rate of cattle ranching expansion and deforestation in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's cattle sector needs to follow the soya industry's example and commit to a moratorium. Both the federal and state governments have to ensure a moratorium is effective by mapping, registering and monitoring rural properties and helping the private sector fulfill its corporate responsibilities. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction and contributes to making Brazil the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 114 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil has measures in place to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders, at this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, to agree on the funding required to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This week we have created a granite shield against bottom trawling in a fragile and ecologically important marine area in Sweden. Our activists sailed into Swedish waters and have so far placed 140 granite rocks (each weighing between 0.5 and 3 tonnes) in the Lilla Middelgrund in the Kattegat. Our intention is to move to nearby Fladen and do the same thing there.
&lt;div&gt;

            “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.” -- Ryunosuke Satoro
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These regions, boasting unique and rich marine life, have been protected on paper by the EU and the Swedish government since 2003 (&lt;a id="a6wi" title="Natura 2000" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm"&gt;Natura 2000&lt;/a&gt;) yet lack any mechanisms to actually stop fishing and other damaging activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8194105.stm" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the video on BBC news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a specially equipped barge, our team is placing a number of large boulders on the seafloor to act as obstacles stopping fishermen from ploughing up the rare habitats of &lt;a id="bixa" title="maerl beds" href="http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk/communities/maerl/m3_1.htm"&gt;maerl beds&lt;/a&gt; and bubble reefs. Bubble reefs (underwater structures created by gasseepage) are amazing habitats of great scientific interest that have only recently been discovered in Sweden. But despite the existence of these vulnerable habitats, bottom trawling, one of most destructive forms of fishing, is common throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real protection needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawlers drag a net across the sea bed, indiscriminately catching everything in its path. This decimates stocks of popular fish, such assole and plaice, and results in a large amount of unwanted bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or dying. It also destroys any living structures that have grown on the sea bed - often acting as a sanctuary for an abundance of other life forms. Without apermanent ban on fishing in this area - there is no hope for the preservation of a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, marine protection exists only on paper. But our seas cannot wait any longer, their survival is at stake and politicians need to take action and implement laws that will protect the life of the seas today and for the future. However, under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) countries do not have the powers to regulate or prohibit fisheries. EU fisheries law states that such decisions have to be taken at an EU-level. This Catch-22 situation needs to be addressed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/plattegrond-van-het-kattegat-t.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, we placed 320 boulders in Germany's Sylt Outer Reef, another "protected" site, which was being destroyed by bottom trawling. In doing so, trawlers have been prevented from fishing on the reef and the boulders have already being colonised by a wealth of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long-term solution, we are calling on the Swedish EU-presidency to reform the CFP, enabling responsible authorities in member states to take necessary conservation measures in all types of marine protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fisherman's friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides showing up with some large stones - our team in Sweden has planned and prepared this work for months. An important step was the preparation of an environmental impact assessment to ensure that the activity would not be damaging to the environment. &lt;a href="http://eiastones.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;We also invited anyone interested - fishermen, politicians and all - to comment on our plans&lt;/a&gt;. The scientific impact assessment concluded that the strategic placement of stones would not negatively impact the marine environment, and the responsible authority shared this view and informed us that we would not need a permit. Fishermen from nearby Varberg also recognised theimportance of our proposal. As one fisherman said: "We shall and we must protect the shallow banks and the refuges that exist there. Then perhaps we can even get the wolf fish back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/greenpeace-activists-strategic.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to defend our oceans from the effects of over-fishing around the world, we are campaigning for a global networkof large fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of our oceans, including the North and Baltic seas. Supported by scientists - these reserves will restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse. Marine reserves also make our oceans more resilient to the ravages of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call now for a global network of marine reserves - protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title> Activists block Australian coal as leaders abandon the Pacific</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/australia-coal-pacific060809/</url><text>
	As activists continue a two day blockade of a coal export terminal in Queensland, Australia, the outcome of the Pacific Islands Forum in nearby Cairns has left Pacific Islanders to fend for themselves against the increasingly devastating effects of climate change - because it's clear their rich neighbours are unlikely to help them. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the single biggest climate criminal
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal blocking activists from countries including New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Australia and the Cook Islands have been demanding that Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd (Australia) and John Key (New Zealand) stop putting the interests of big polluters over the future and the very survival of Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island leaders this week called for strong emissions reductiontargets of 45 percent by 2020 for developed countries and an ambitious global climate treaty aiming to limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5 °C. On Tuesday, the Small Island States leaders reiterated these demands at a press conference. But just two days later, not only have those demands vanished from the final communiqué, but the 2020 targets have also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of seeing an agreement on emissions cuts to fight climate change, the PacificIslands have received only promises to build higher sea walls against the rising tides caused by, amongst other things, Australian coal exports. This is yet another setback to the already shambolic negotiations process in the leadup to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter where this coal is burned, carbon pollution has no borders. Our homes are being devastated by climate change and we need genuine support from our Australian neighbours, not make-believe emissions cuts and empty &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;gestures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam, activist from Papua New Guinea speaking as he blocked the Abbot Point coal export&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal or climate Kevin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftering our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/blog/energy/?p=728"&gt;activists spent 36 hours hanging off the Hay Point coal port&lt;/a&gt;, we sent our ship, Esperanza, to continue blocking the terminal. We have run three days of coal actions, including the complete shut down of the Abbot Point coal export terminal, to highlight the injustice of Australia and New Zealand abandoning their Pacific neighbours while throwing tax payer dollars at dying fossil fueled industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal exports to rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbot Point coal export terminal is set to double in size, financed by more than AUS$328 million (198 million euros) of public money in 2009/10. This will add an extra 67.5 million tonnes of carbon pollution a year - equal to the annual carbon footprint of 2.4 million Australians. And even though the Hay Point coal export terminal is already one of the biggest in the world, it is now being expanded from 112 to 190 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total capacity of Australia's coal exports will more than double from 332 to 730 millions tonnes per year. This expansion is a snub for the Pacific, and an economic and environmental disaster for Australia. By reinforcing Australia's position as the world's largest carbon dealer, Kevin Rudd continues to shun both his neighbours and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling short of weak targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear here: a global temperature rise of 2°C would still cause climate chaos in the Pacific. And if the world adopted the policies Kevin Rudd is implementing there is little chance of limiting temperature rise even to 2°C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24990/australia-coal-block3.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Key is expected to announce New Zealand's 2020 targets on Monday, but they are likely to also fall way short of the at least 40 percent by 2020 required - a target set by the climate scientists and &lt;a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/"&gt;demanded by nearly 90,000 New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that temperature rise must peak as far below two degrees as possible, and to get back to much safer levels after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see more than 12 coal ships waiting to load coal behind me. There are mountains of coal. It is a bit overwhelming - tonnes and tonnes of it. Everything I see here means to me that there's one more family that will be affected, one more child that won't have the future they &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;deserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza, which continues to block the Hay Point coal terminal, has just finished a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/07/pacific_voices_on_climate_chan.html"&gt; tour of several Pacific islands where the crew witnessed the impacts of climate change there first hand&lt;/a&gt;. They spoke to many Pacific people who are forced to deal with the changing environment on a daily basis. Now, in Australia - we're continuing to support the urgent Pacific call for world leaders to act now: to take personal responsibility for tackling climate change and guaranteeing a good deal for the climate in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join the call for world leaders to personally attend the UN Climate Summit this December in Copenhagen - and ensure a good deal for the Pacific and the rest of the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It is finally time to celebrate a major victory for the Boreal Forest! Kimberly-Clark has, as a result of public pressure, released a new environmental fibre policy that governs how it will help conserve forests and support sustainable forestry and use more recycled fibre.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Boreal forest is the largest intact forest ecosystem in North America. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;our campaign&lt;/a&gt; has been supported by tens of thousands of activists and hundreds of companies, to demand that Kimberly-Clark (K-C) stop destroying ancient forests like the Boreal Forest. In this tremendous victory for ancient forests,  the company that is known for its popular brands like Kleenex, Scott, and Cottonelle has announced &lt;a title="KC policy" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/KC"&gt;a policy&lt;/a&gt; that places it among the industry leaders in sustainability. This announcement brings the &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Kleercut campaign&lt;/a&gt; to a successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we can expect from the new policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark has set a goal of obtaining 100 percent of the wood fibre used in its products - including the flagship brand Kleenex - from environmentally responsible sources. By 2011, Kimberly-Clark will ensure that 40 percent of its North American fiber is either recycled or certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) - a 71 percent increase from 2007 levels, representing over 600,000 tonnes of fibre. Also by 2011, it will eliminate any fiber from the North American Boreal Forest that is not FSC®-certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of K-C's place in the paper products market, the company's new policy will send a strong signal to its competitors, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, SCA, and Georgia Pacific, that creating a policy that protects ancient forests is a key element of sustainable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;K-C's sustainability policy: Not just about protecting the Boreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Boreal Forest is North America's largest ancient forest and provides habitat to threatened species such as woodland caribou, bald and golden eagles, wolverine and more than one billion birds, many of them migratory. Sadly, more than 60 percent of the Boreal has already been allocated to forestry companies for development and less than 10 percent of the Boreal Forest is formally protected. Unfortunately, in provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, much of the commercial forest has already been fragmented and degraded by clearcuts and logging roads...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clear-cutting in forests doesn't just wipe out biodiversity - it wipes out an essential carbon storehouse. The Boreal Forest is the world's largest storehouse of terrestrial carbon. The Canadian Boreal stores an estimated 186 billion tonnes of carbon, or more than 27 years worth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting and managing the forest responsibly is essential for fighting climate change. Intact forests, particularly ones extending over thousands of square kilometres, better mitigate the impacts of climate change. The fight to protect the Boreal and forests globally is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need world leaders to agree on the funding required to end deforestation at this years Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our marathon action in Chioggia, Italy came to an end last night after three days of protest when Italian police intervened to end our blockade of the Panama-registered bulk carrier, Keoyang Majesty, which is carrying 40,000 thousands tons of Argentine Genetically Engineered (GE) Soya.

            Greenpeace canoeist  arrested by the Guadia di Finanza during an action to prevent the offloading of 40,000 tonnes of Argentian GE Soya from the bulk carrier Keoyang Majesty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the determination of 18 activists from our ship, the
Esperanza, this action has been going on since Sunday morning, when
they first boarded the Keoyang Majesty displaying banners saying
'Don't Buy GE Food' and 'Defend Yourself from GMOs'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night they left the GE ship for safety reasons, this
morning the focus changed to preventing the trans-shipment system,
used to offload the cargo from the ship onto small barges, actually
reaching the ship. Two activists boarded one of the barges, ten
activists climbed onto the elevator used to take the GE soya out of
the GE ship and six activists were in canoes between the barge and
the Keoyang Majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the blockade the Italian Ministry of Health has
committed itself to carry out an inspection of the GE Soya now
being unloaded from the Keoyang Majesty in order to check whether
the GE cargo complies with EU legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Pagnan, the company importing the GE soya meal, has
stated to our campaigners in Italy that it will provide us with the
list of the buyers for its cargo of soymeal. We will of course be
taking this issue up with these companies and put pressure on them
to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Keoyang Majesty from Argentina is transporting GE soya meal
for, among others, the multinational companies Bunge and Cargill,
to be used for animal feed. Italy imports 4.2 million tons of soya
annually for food and animal feed of which over 3 million tons are
estimated to be GE or GE contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto our GE campaigner from Argentina, who is on
board the Esperanza said: "Argentina is determined to produce GE
soya to feed pigs, cows and chickens in the developed world. Almost
its entire production of soya is GE. What remains of the native
forest lands are being converted for GE soya production, it is time
to stop this environmental and social nightmare in Argentina."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Parody of Esso logo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our "Don't buy Esso, Don't buy Exxon/Mobil" campaign,
we developed a parody of Esso's logo with a double dollar sign:
E$$O. (Esso is the name under which Exxon/Mobil trades in many
parts of the world outside North America)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso took us to court for copyright infringement, claiming our
Stop Esso website would "confuse customers" into thinking they were
at a real Esso site. Hmmm. Esso customers must be a particularly
dim lot. Would you be confused by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that wasn't enough, Esso also made the feeble attempt to
claim that the logo made them look like Nazis, given a similarity
only they could see between two dollar signs together and the
stylized Nazi SS symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" title="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52918"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
the real belly laugh came when Esso claimed that our abuse of their
logo would damage their "good reputation." This is the company that
has done more than any other corporation to undermine the science
and policy debate on global warming. This is the company that
donated massively to George Bush's election campaign, and was
rewarded with the US withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol. This is
the company that despoiled the pristine Alaskan coastline with an
oil spill the effects of which are still with us today. This is the
company responsible for &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040128/energy_exxon_climate_1.html"&gt;5
percent of all greenhouse gasses&lt;/a&gt; on the planet. This is the
company which has been branded environmental criminal #1 and been
targeted by activists all over the world in a massive "Don't Buy
Esso" campaign. If Esso was really worried about its reputation, it
might try doing something for our planet and our children's future
instead of using its gargantuan legal resources to try and stamp
out the wildfire of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court ruled our parody of the Esso logo was within
acceptable limits of freedom of expression, rejecting Esso's claims
of tradmark infringement. Greenpeace has been campaigning against
the oil giant since 2001 when US President George Bush pulled the
US out of the international negotiations to tackle climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso has spent millions in its fight to stop the world's
government's tackling climate change, and was behind Bush pulling
out of the Kyoto Protocol. Esso obviously thought this case would
be an easy win but it was wrong. Today's ruling is a victory in the
fight to protect the climate against a company that will go to any
means to silence its critics," said Greenpeace campaigner, Anita
Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with us. Next time you pass an Esso or Exxon station,
put your thumb to your nose, wiggle your fingers, and say:
Naaa-naaa-naaa-naaa-naaaaa, Don't buy E$$O!&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Canadian harp seal hunt: largest ever</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/harp-seal-hunt/</url><text>
	The Canadian government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 350,000 animals this year. While "whitecoat" harp seals (under 2 weeks old) are still protected as a result of actions by Greenpeace and other organisations in the 70s and 80s, and some of the more extreme animal rights abuses have been outlawed, older seals can still be legally hunted under Canadian law.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace  activist sprays a seal with harmless dye to render its pelt worthless to commercial hunters in 1982.  An EU ban on killing harp seals under 2 weeks old put an end to the commercial hunt for whitecoats -- but not to the killing of older seals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's quota is the highest for any year since 1967.
Canada's cod fishery collapsed in the early 90s, and some in Canada
blamed the seals, despite the fact that the greatest culprit was
clearly decades of human overfishing. The collapse of fisheries
around Newfoundland due to mismanagement are a major driver in the
economics of expanding the seal hunt -- and part of an all too
predictable cycle of "exploit, deplete, and move on" which have
characterised human commercial hunts of wild animals the world
over. History has taught us that as soon as a market exists and
profits are to be made, the pressure to hunt a species beyond
sustainable population levels will inevitably lead to a
non-sustainable hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oppose any human activity harmful to populations of seals. We
oppose the killing of seals for commercial trade. We oppose taking
animals from endangered, threatened or seriously reduced
populations, from populations whose status is unknown or where it
is thought a hunt may have an adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add new uncertainties about how global warming is
impacting fragile arctic environments, an expanded hunt means the
impacts on seal populations are at best uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned
against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since
that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, and other organisations, have taken the lead in
campaigning against the slaughter of seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and other organisations taking action against the
commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take action with the &lt;a href="http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=21446" target="_blank"&gt;International Fund for Animal Welfare,&lt;/a&gt; where

<item><language>en</language><title>Wind: more jobs and power for same investment</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/no-to-new-nukes-go-wind/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace says no to new French nuke with wind turbines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the French power authority has refused to build wind farms, we built our own this morning on the grounds of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France. We put ten wind turbines up to protest the French government decision to build another nuclear reactor on the site, despite a large nuclear energy overcapacity and the far more environmentally and economically sane option of investing in wind energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/12/greenpeace-activists-display-1.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/12/greenpeace-activists-display-1.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists display 10 model wind turbines on the premises of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France in protest at the French government's decision to build another reactor on the site.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franc for franc, wind is the better investment. As detailed in a
report published today, "Wind vs Nuclear 2003" the same money spent
on wind power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more
electricity than a nuclear reactor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of the proposed French reactor is officially estimated
at some 3-3.5 billion Euros. If this amount of money were invested
in wind power, some 7616 megawatts of wind capacity could be built,
compared to 1550 TWh in the nuclear case. Wind would generate a
massive 24 TWh per year, the equivalent of 6.5 million households.
Nuclear would only deliver 10 terrawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years wind power has gone from the hippy fringe to
economic viability. In Germany, over 3,200 megawatts of wind power
were installed in the last year alone, supplying electricity to
more than 2 million households. In the EU, a massive 75,000
megawatts of wind capacity is expected to be online by 2010,
tripling the current power and adding the equivalent electricity
production of 14 large nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this worries the nuclear industry, especially given
the current decline in nukes: no single reactor has been connected
to the grid in the last four years, and it would take at least
another 10 years before a new reactor could come online. A growing
number of old reactors have reached the end of their life
expectancies and should be shut down. In reality, wind has already
taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is urging state owned EdF, Electricity de France,
not to impose yet another dangerous and uneconomic nuclear reactor
on Europe. The EPR [European Pressurized Reactor] is nothing new,
it is an outdated and unsafe design, to be fuelled by plutonium and
will produce extremely radioactive waste," said our campaigner on
site, Jan Vande Putte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europe is at a crossroad and we refuse to let the nuclear lobby
dictate our energy future regardless of the opinion, the
environment and the security of people. Greenpeace asks EDF to make
the right choice."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-on-toxic-patrol-in/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace sailing vessel the Rainbow Warrior is currently anchored off the coast of Alang, India. Alang is the site of the world's largest shipbreaking yard. Greenpeace is planning to conduct "toxic patrols" of ships which are here waiting for scrapping. A team of experts will do a survey and take samples to determine what type of toxic materials are on board before the ships are beached and the actual scrapping starts. Shipbreaking is an enormous danger for people and the environment. Greenpeace is the only organization in the world fighting for the 100,000 people working in this industry and for the environment they live in.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 14th of October the highest court in India decided that
the responsibility for clean scrap (shipbreaking) lies not just
with the shipbreakers, but also, and more importantly, with the
ship owners. This Court Order says that all ships must be
toxic-free before the scrapping actually begins. If the Greenpeace
"toxic patrols" show that ships arriving in India for scraping
still contain toxic substances, we will demand that the Indian
government enforce the Supreme Court Order and take action against
the owners of these ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also lobbying the Indian government to take a
strong position in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
with the other shipbreaking countries (Bangladesh, China, Pakistan
and Turkey). The IMO is the only party, within the United Nations,
which can make international rules for the ship owners. At the
moment they have only proposed voluntary guidelines for the
shipbreaking industry. Greenpeace believes that only a mandatory
international law can effectively regulate the ship owners. At this
stage there are many ruses that ship owners can use to subvert
these the rules and regulations. If India is the only country that
has strict regulations on shipbreaking then ship owners will go
elsewhere to find lax regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Scrap yard Alang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alang shipbreaking yards started scrapping ships in 1983 and
is now the world's biggest. Alang contains 184 plots which employ
40.000 workers. Current shipbreaking methods pose a serious danger
to both people and the environment. Most of the toxic waste ends up
in the ocean. The workers inhale toxic substances, such as
asbestos, 24 hours a day: at work and, because they live right next
to the yards, at home. They are not provided with any protective
clothing or safety equipment nor are they provided with any
training on how to deal with toxic materials. There are regular
accidents in the yards which often cause the deaths of many people.
In the past three months there have been 4 explosions in which 25
people died. On top of all this most workers are paid on average
US$1 per day and have no system of worker's medical insurance or
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What Greenpeace wants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is not against shipbreaking or the shipbreakers.
Greenpeace wants a mandatory international law requiring that all
ships must have an inventory of all toxic materials on board.
Locations of materials must be clear. A plan must be made to remove
all these toxic materials before the ship goes for scrap and before
the ship gets scrapped it must be made fuel-free to avoid future
explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today informed the French government at a hearing that we will not remove information concerning nuclear waste transports from our websites.  This defies an order from the French Ministry of Industry to treat all information regarding nuclear materials in France and their transport as state secrets.  As a consequence, Greenpeace France and its staff may be facing jail and fines for informing the public about dangerous plutonium shipments.

            Greenpeace activists protesting nuclear power at Cattenom.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An order issued on August 9th in Paris declared all information
regarding the protection of nuclear materials, including
transports, classified for national security purposes. Greenpeace
is opposed to the production, transport and use of plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the transportation of plutonium, released in defiance
of the new decree, will be presented by Greenpeace at a "Special
Commission" that will hold a meeting on nuclear affairs today.
Politicians, Government officials and representatives of Cogema,
the state reprocessing company in Cherbourg, will attend this
meeting. The head of nuclear security within the French Government,
M. Lallemand, responsible for issuing the new security decree, is
also scheduled to testify at the Special Commission hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February this year Greenpeace blocked a nuclear transport
containing 150 kilogram of pure plutonium in the city center of
Chalon-sur-Saone, while en route from la Hague, Normandy to
Marcoule, in Provence. Cogema, the state nuclear reprocessing
company, conducts as many as 2-3 transports every week from its
reprocessing complex at la Hague to its plutonium fuel production
plant at Marcoule. Each transport carries enough plutonium for 30
nuclear weapons. In May, after Cogema resumed transports,
Greenpeace launched a 'citizens inspection' website containing
information on plutonium transports observed by volunteers and
activists along the 1000 kilometre route: &lt;a href="http://www.stop-plutonium.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stop-plutonium.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Putting us in jail to keep us quiet will not remove the
danger." said Yannick Rousselet. "Nuclear fuel shipments are
dangerous to the communities they move through, they are potential
terrorist targets, and they should be stopped rather than covered
up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the order flies in the face of nuclear industry
company Areva's policy of "maximum openness" regarding nuclear
transports. Under the new order, much of what Areva publishes on
their website and releases to the public would be classified
illegal. But according to an Areva spokesperson quoted in Le Monde,
the nuclear industry, which claims it was not consulted on the new
law, was told "we didn't need to change anything in our
communication policy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Opposing nuclear transports in France." title="Opposing nuclear transports in France." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47188"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
target of the order is Greenpeace, which has exposed the threat
from land and sea transports of nuclear fuel and waste in France
and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear materials travel a cumulative distance of 250,000
kilometres each year in France. One plutonium transport contains
sufficient material for 30 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. One cask
full of highly radioactive spent fuel elements contains
approximately as much radiation as was released by the Chernobyl
disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry claims that the casks are safe because they
have to undergo crash tests. In fact, they are tested to maintain
integrity when dropped 9 metres onto a hard rigid surface, or
dropped 1 metre onto a metal bar. They are tested to survive a 30
minute hydrocarbon fire at 800 °C. And they are cited as safe for
immersion to a depth of 15 metres of water for 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet according to French accident statistics for hazardous
materials, the casks would not withstand 1 accident in 20 involving
impact, and 50% of accidents involving fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transports could also be targets for terrorist attacks or theft:
Pierre Robert, a Frenchman jailed for life in Morroco for
terrorism, claimed to know of Al-Quaeda plans to attack a Cogema
plutonium transport. Greenpeace and WISE, in a report published in
February of this year, estimated that if such an attack were
carried out with heavy artillery near Lyon, it would impact 125,000
people, cause 500 fatal cancers and require the evacuation of part
of the city of Lyon and its outlying suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Stop Plutonium" title="Stop Plutonium" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47173"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Transports
are carried out without prior notification or consent of the
communities or countries along the transport routes. Last year
Greenpeace tracked and highlighted the dangers of a British
plutonium fuel transport from Japan to the UK. Over 80 Governments
condemned the transport based upon information provided by the
environmental organization along the 30,000 kilometre route through
the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French government's move to silence Greenpeace is consistent
with a larger move worldwide toward greater government secrecy in
the name of security. The nuclear industry in particular is taking
advantage of public fears of terrorist attack to become less
transparent and to silence dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, hundreds of thousands of public documents
were removed from government Web sites following the September 11th
attacks, including Environmental Protection Agency reports on the
consequences of industrial accidents. U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft's Justice Department told U.S. agencies to be more
cautious about releasing records and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If governments are serious about reducing the threat of nuclear
materials," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International "then the
only thing to do is end nuclear power. Increased secrecy
conveniently serves the nuclear industry's agenda of diminished
scrutiny. That means greater risks to an uninformed public, and
less public opposition. Plutonium and nuclear energy are not
compatible with democracy and have no place in our global
society."&lt;/p&gt;

	Spain is the only country in the European Union that tolerates the release of genetically engineered (GM) crops on a commercial scale. Though only cultivated on relatively small areas, the potential impact of Syngenta's GE maize on environment, agriculture and health and the total lack of information and precaution are of serious concern.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/8/new-report-from-greenpeace-sla.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New report from Greenpeace slams the genetic experiment on maize in Spain
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GM maize (corn) contains a genetic construct called Bt 176,
consisting of a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis
that encodes an insecticidal toxin able to kill the European Corn
Borer. It also has a gene that confers increased tolerance to a
herbicide and a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic
ampicillin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngenta's (formerly Novartis) Bt176 corn was first grown in the
USA in 1996. The European Commission approved the placing on the
market of the GE crop in 1997, with a decision that was ignoring
the negative recommendations of the EU's own scientific committee
and the Environment Ministers Council. Several EU member states,
among them Austria, Luxembourg and Germany, prohibited the growing
of Bt176 maize due to concerns over detrimental environmental and
health effects. The Spanish authorities, however, approved the
commercial growing in 1998. While they are still on sale in Spain
today, the Bt176 varieties were already withdrawn in 2001 from the
list of approved varieties in the USA, a country known for its
support for GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52690"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
Spanish government not only ignored concerns over environmental and
human health risks, but also the fact that a majority of Spanish
consumers, as consumers in many other countries around the world,
say 'no' to GE foods and prefer non-GE products, even if the
genetically modified foods were much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report, "The impact of GM corn in Spain," has been
prepared by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. It reveals the
scandalous sloppiness around the planting of Syngenta's genetically
engineered maize in Spain. While the Spanish administration acted
irresponsibly in largely passing on responsibility for safety
standards to the GE company, Syngenta failed to meet even the lax
requirements that the government did impose. Five years after the
approval of the GE crop, the monitoring / prevention plan has still
not been made public. No official data is available on the exact
area planted with GE crops or on where they are planted; nor is
there an independent analysis of GE crop results in agronomic
terms, of the possible appearance of resistance in pest, of the
unwanted impacts on non-target species and soil ecosystem, or of
the effects of antibiotic resistance genes on animals and
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been proven that the GE varieties cultivated in Spain
give better results than conventional ones and are necessary and
useful for pest control. The low incidence of the corn-borer pest
in Spain does not justify taking the high risk of introducing Bt
maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52687"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
the meantime, the first cases of GE contamination have already
occurred in Spain. In 2001, organically grown maize in the Navarra
region was contaminated by Bt176 maize and, as a consequence,
farmers suffered losses since the crop couldn't be marketed as
organic produce. This illustrates how the 'polluter-pays' principle
is turned into a 'contaminated-farmer-pays' principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-author Juan-Felipe Carrasco of Greenpeace Spain said: "Spain
has become a big experimental field, where GE crops have been
cultivated for the last 5 years without any agronomic advantage
compared to conventional varieties and where no measures have been
adopted to prevent their negative impacts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish situation highlights the need for measures to
prevent the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;genetic contamination of conventional and organic crops and
should serve as a warning for the other European countries. No new
authorisation for growing of GM plants should be granted and, most
urgently, Member States should oppose the plans of the European
Commission to legalise the contamination of seeds by setting up
thresholds of authorised GE contamination in conventional seed
lots. Allowing contaminated seeds to be put on the market would
lead to a creeping and unmonitorable contamination of all European
farmlands by GMOs that would make it impossible to sustain a
GE-free supply after a few years. GE companies should instead be
made legally and financially liable for the environmental and
economic damages their products can cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing genetic contamination and other negative effects of
GE crops should now be the number one priority for the Spanish
Government instead of actively promoting GE agriculture in Spain.
We call on Spain to apply the precautionary principle and to stop
the growing of GE crops. The Spanish example should be a warning
signal to other European countries not to allow GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Turn the page and the forests are Finnished</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/paper-exports-may-finnish-the/</url><text>
	Europe is known more for its ancient cities than ancient forests. And if Finnish paper companies have their way, there may soon be nothing left of the old forests that once covered most of Europe. But Greenpeace activists confronted paper imports in Germany to expose the ongoing destruction of Finland's forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/greenpeace-activists-paint-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/greenpeace-activists-paint-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint 'Forest Crime in Europe' on the hull of a paper carried to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists onboard inflatable boats intercepted the paper carrier "Finn Hawk" as it entered the Baltic Port of Luebeck in Germany. As the Finn Hawk navigated towards its berth, the activists painted "Forest Crime in Europe" on the hull of the ship to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finn Hawk is loaded with paper products from the Finnish paper companies Stora Enso and M-Real; both continue to buy wood for its products from the last of Finland's ancient forests. Other activists on the pier held a banner that read "Forest ministers of Europe: save our ancient forests".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want European ministers to make the right decisions to increase ancient forest protection in Europe during next week's Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe taking place in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after numerous conversations over the last 12 months, the paper companies have taken no real measures to stop the destruction of ancient forests in Finland. In fact, they are peddling their ancient forest destruction to Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few areas of Europe's formerly vast ancient forests still exist in Finland. Less than five percent of the current Finnish forest cover is ancient forest and only half of that is protected from industrial logging and further destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami and other traditional communities. In the north-eastern part of Finland, many ancient forest areas are still unprotected and are being destroyed by the state-owned forest enterprise Metsahallitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main customers for the timber harvested by Metsahallitus are three international paper companies. This ancient forest timber is processed into pulp, magazine grade, fine paper and cardboard in the Finnish paper mills of Stora Enso, UPM Kymmene and M-Real then shipped to destinations in Europe and overseas. The ancient forests ends up as copy paper, envelopes, packaging, and in a range of publications from magazines and newspapers to advertising flyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, very few ancient forests and high conservation value forests are protected in Europe. Greenpeace is calling on European ministers to make real decisions to further the protection of the last ancient forests instead of only stressing sustainable forest management, which can not adequately protect Europe's forests alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure you are not buying products coming from ancient forest destruction, look for the FSC® logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC®, or Forest Stewardship Council™, is an international non-profit organisation that issues certificates for well managed forests and was created so that corporate buyers and individual consumers can identify products coming from responsible forest management. Look for the FSC® logo to the left on wood and paper products to make sure you aren't buying forest destruction or supporting illegal logging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When buying paper products, look closely to make sure they are made from 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper or other agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Gallon had a brilliant career as an environmentalist, with
the Society for the Promotion of Environmental Conservation (SPEC),
the Environmental Liaison Centre in Nairobi, at Pollution Probe,
and later with the Ontario government. He is probably most well
known lately for The Gallon Environment Letter, a widely
distributed environment and business e-newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gallon's formal involvement with Greenpeace was limited
to the early days in Vancouver, when he loaned us our first "real"
office space, his work and ours overlapped and complemented each
other at various points over the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, Gary Gallon received the Canadian Institute for
Business and Environment's Life Time Achievement Environment
Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To monitor the amount of timber leaving the Amazon state of
Pará, the Brazilian environment ministry did away with paper
dockets and two years ago introduced an online system. Companies
logging the rainforest for timber or charcoal production are only
allowed to fell a certain amount of timber every year and this is
controlled by the use of transport permits issued by the state
government's computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be exported from Pará, each shipment of timber requires one
of these transport permits, and the volume of timber in each
shipment is deducted from the total amount allowed under the
company's forest management plan. Once that amount is reduced to
zero, no more transport permits are issued so there's no profit in
felling more trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil, the world's "hacking capital"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what's supposed to happen. But today the public
prosecutor will release details of how hackers employed by 107
logging and charcoal companies have compromised the system,
falsifying online records to increase the timber transport
allocations for certain areas of the forest. In the past, Brazil
has been called the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3657170.stm"&gt;world's
hacking capital&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href="http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;amp;name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;amp;sid=743"&gt;
history of criminal gangs&lt;/a&gt; hacking into bank computer systems to
engage in large-scale online fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hacking has led to 1.7million cubic metres of timber being
illegally smuggled out of Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the Amazon hacking scandal is that nearly 1.7
million cubic metres of illegal timber have been smuggled out of
the Amazon, enough to fill 780 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The
sums of money involved are also huge, and the public prosecutor is
suing the companies responsible for 2 billion reais (US $833m).
According to federal prosecutor Daniel Avelino, many of these
companies have a track record of illegal practices: "Almost half of
the companies involved in this scam have other law suits pending
for environmental crimes or the use of slave labour, amongst other
things."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investigation started in April 2007&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police started investigating the suspect hackers in April 2007,
swooping in a couple of months later to arrest 30 ring leaders. One
is still in jail - the intermediary who brought the hackers and the
loggers together - in total, 202 people are facing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André Muggiati, campaigner in our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/"&gt;Amazon office&lt;/a&gt; in
Manaus, told me they have flagged up potential security holes in
the past. "We've pointed out before that this method of controlling
the transport of timber was subject to fraud. And this is only the
tip of the iceberg, because the same computer system is also used
in two other Brazilian states."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By hacking into the permit system, these companies have made
their timber shipments appear legal and compliant with the forest
management plans. But in reality, they're trading illegal timber
which is making the problem of deforestation worse, and a lack of
control and policing in the areas they're logging means they think
they can get away with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Scandal comes as Brazilian national congress prepares to vote
on forest code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scandal weren't bad enough, it comes as the Brazilian
national congress prepares to vote on a change to the country's
forest code which could massively increase the amount of legal
logging that will be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, land owners in the Amazon are able to clear trees
from 20 per cent of their property but if the proposed changes are
adopted, it will raise that to 50 per cent. Given the contentious
nature of land ownership in the region, no one knows exactly the
damage this will cause but as deforestation rates are once again on
the increase, it's certain to push them up even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil must adopt a zero deforestation plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scandal of loggers and hackers just demonstrates that the
Brazilian government is failing to protect the Amazon forest from
logging companies determined to break the law. If the rainforest is
to have any long-term future, the only answer is to adopt a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt;
zero deforestation plan&lt;/a&gt;, like the one we and other campaign
groups think is needed, setting ambitious targets to bring
deforestation under control. Otherwise illegal logging and
corporate fraud such this will continue to be a massive
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

	The ship breaking industry provides one of the clearest examples of exploiting the environment and workers for profit. But thanks to the exposure of this toxic trade and public pressure, the industry is slowly realising it must clean up its act. Help us maintain the pressure.

            Workers at Alang shipbreaking yard.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ship reaches the end of its life it needs to be disposed
of. For something which maybe several stories high, hundreds of
metres long and full of various hazardous chemicals and explosive
fuel/gases, this is not an easy job. Most shipping companies take
the profitable option of selling the ships to scrap yards in Asia
where ships are broken up on beaches by workers using their bare
hands or minimal equipment. Hence the shipping company makes some
easy money and dumps the pollution from the ship in the developing
countries of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some irresponsible shipping companies want to spread this toxic
trade to Africa. The beautiful Bolama beach in the west African
country of Guinea Bissau may soon be turned into a scrap yard for
old toxic ships, threatening nature and the lives of local people.
The beach is part of the Bijagos Archipelagos, classified as a
Biosphere Reserve by United Nations (UNESCO). In May we started an
online action to save the Bolama beach. It has already achieved an
initial result: after receiving thousands of messages from
concerned people from all over the world, UNESCO has sent a
research mission to assess the situation. But continued pressure is
necessary to make sure that UNESCO takes effective measures to
protect Bolama Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=766&amp;amp;s=ship"&gt;Send a message now&lt;/a&gt; to stop the nature reserve being turned into a scrap yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Shipbreaking web game" border="0" align="left" item_id="50797"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
companies behind this plan are some of the bad guys in the murky
world of the shipping industry. To shine a light on the dirty
business of selling ships for shipbreaking, we have developed a
unique new web game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you know &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/shipgame/"&gt;'the tricks
of the trade'&lt;/a&gt;. You are the owner of the old ship "Rubbish
Queen" and you have to get rid of it. Can you make as much profit
as possible? Or do you care for the people and the environment? Try
to do better than most current ship owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the number of ships for scrap increases. It is
estimated that by 2010, 3000 ships per year will be scrapped. To
pressure the industry to reform we have put 50 ships heading for
scrap under the spotlight. We asked the owners to commit to
cleaning the toxic material from the ships before selling them for
scrapping. Recently the first company from the list,
American/Norwegian ship owner Stolt Nielsen, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news45.asp"&gt;committed
to prevent future pollution and health threats&lt;/a&gt; associated with
the breaking of ships. The company has a history of dumping
contaminated ships on Indian beaches. This company can prove that
ships can be disposed of without harming the environment and
endangering workers in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

	The final outcome of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is too weak to stop overfishing of Pacific bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Pacific islanders are still at great risk from the collapse of this fishery. But the decision to close two of the high seas pockets, between Pacific Island countries, to purse seine fishing from 2010 has left them with a shred of hope.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will also consider the closure of a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
third high seas area&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. We have been campaigning for
these areas to be designated as marine reserves &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/where-are-the-pacific-tuna/"&gt;
since 2004&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, our ship, Esperanza, patrolled these high seas areas
for over ten weeks. During this time we took action againstfishing
fleets from &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;
Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-demonstra"&gt;
Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3"&gt;
US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pacific-pirate-busted100508/"&gt;
Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support sustainable fisheries, protect marine life
and clean up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; in the region - &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning since 2001 that the bigeye and
yellowfin stocks in the Pacific are in decline and recommended a
minimum 30 percent reduction in fishing for 2009. Yet the
commission only agreed to cut fishing on bigeye tuna with a range
of measures including a 10 percent reduction for longliners
only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25073/greenpeace-activists-from-fiji.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Greenpeace activists from Fiji and
Papua New Guinea stand on juvenileyellowfin and skipjack tuna in
the hold of a vessel that was caughtoffloading fish from purse
seiners in the Pacific Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuna exterminators strike back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Island countries, and the US
all put up a strong front to save the Pacific tuna. But resistance
from Japan, Korea, China, Chinese Taipei and the Philippines meant
that fishing will not be reduced enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nations, with a huge appetite for tuna, resisted moves to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, despite strong
economic arguments. Recent studies indicate that the fishing
industry is undermining its own profits by having too many fishing
vessels on the water and by depleting stocks to the point that fish
are harder to catch. We've been calling for a precautionary 50
percent fishing reduction in order to ensure both the long term
sustainability and profitability of the fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just add water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than protecting their fishing future - these
shortsighted governments are sending entire species into oblivion.
As usual consensus based decision making ensured that many
agreements were diluted to the lowest common denominator -
determined only by short term interests. The needs of the Pacific
Island States, whose livelihoods and economies depend on tuna, have
been neglected yet again - despite members of the fishing industry
calling upon these nations to follow the advice of scientists and
reduce fishing by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets and marine reserves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save fish for the future we're now calling on
retailers and fish purchasers  to stop buying all overfished
bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as well as skipjack caught using
fish aggregation devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also continuing to push for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of fully protected marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; covering 40
percent of our oceans. This will help to; buffer our seas from the
ravages of climate change, restore the health of fish stocks and
protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Thanks to donations from individuals like you - we are able to support the Pacific islanders who are trying to preserve their way of life and economies. We don't accept donations from government or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The nuclear industry has had fifty years of massive subsidies and state help – but has delivered only unsafe, expensive power, contamination and waste that will last for thousands of generations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mickey Mouse climate solutions
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, over 350 non-governmental organisations including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF told delegates at the UN climate talks that nuclear power is not a climate solution but a dangerous distraction from investment in renewable power and energy efficiency. Representing millions of members in 48 countries, the organisations have proclaimed nuclear power a "Mickey Mouse climate solution" and delivered a global call to keep it out of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to pass up the chance of ever more state support and win more taxpayers' money, the nuclear industry is presenting itself as a practical solution to climate change. One of the privileges this dirty and dying industry wants now is to become eligible for support under Kyoto Treaty mechanisms. If that goes through, a country such as France could finance the construction of a reactor in a developing country by a French firm - giving money to its own companies and claiming "emission allowances" for itself so that it doesn't have to reduce its own domestic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to include nuclear power in the Kyoto Protocol CDM is currently being discussed at the UN Climate talks in Poznan These talks coincide with a run of bad news for the nuclear industry that makes its claims of clean cheap power even harder to justify. Following the news of soaring costs for the European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) in &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/epr_history_repeating_costs_up.html"&gt; France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/the_financial_times_finlands_s.html"&gt; Finland&lt;/a&gt; and  in the estimated budgets for &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/dont_believe_the_hype.html"&gt; reactors planned in the US&lt;/a&gt;, came the news that South-Africa - till now seen as one of the most promising candidates for a so-called nuclear "renaissance" - &lt;a title="Nukes out of Africa" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/non_merci_areva_is_out_of_afri.html"&gt;is backing off for a while&lt;/a&gt;: the planned French reactors are simply too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented its pro-nuclear case in Poznan last week, we were there to confront them with reality. And the IAEA had no defence other than to say that things would get better in the future! This is something that we and our parents have been hearing for fifty years now. The IAEA needs to stop dreaming - the climate will not wait and we need to get serious about combating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bring some facts to the debate, Greenpeace has prepared &lt;a title="Facts on Nuclear Power" href="/international/PageFiles/25075/getting-serious-about-nuclear.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Together with other NGOs, we also organised our own official "side event" in Poznan - a specialised session that exposed the facts behind the nuclear "renaissance" smokescreen: nuclear power has been in decline in recent years, with more reactors being closed than built; escalating costs combined with the recent financial crisis are having a devastating effect on the nuclear industry's reputation with financial institutions and bankers. We were delighted to see a crowd of over 100 press and country delegates getting detailed facts on the poor performance of the nuclear industry, something the nuclear industry has been trying to hide from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This side event alone isn't going to stop the nuclear lobby trying to sneak in by the backdoor to get its grubby hands on climate mitigation funding. But it's clear there's a very depressed mood in the nuclear industry's camp, and that negotiators and press from all over the whole world are beginning to understand that the nuclear "renaissance" hype is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Tell governments the world is watching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Sending out an SOS for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tuna-sos-081208/</url><text>
	Our activists together with Korean environmental group KFEM created a huge human "SOS Tuna" banner on the shores of a beach in Busan, Korea, as a key regional meeting in Korea began this week. This extremely critical meeting will decide the fate of valuable tuna stocks in the Pacific, which are now seriously threatened due to overfishing. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Time and tuna are running out!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific ocean is rich in marine life and home to over 20 IslandNations. Today, the Pacific supplies over 6 percent of the world's tuna. Butoverfishing in other areas of the world means more and more boats aremoving in, and chasing fewer and fewer fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge industrial tuna boats, capable of catching as many tuna in onetrip as some of the countries are able to take in a year, areplundering this vulnerable region at a rate that means trouble for thetuna as well as the people whose livelihoods and futures depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These boats originate from countries like Korea, Japan and Taiwan andfeed the ever-increasing appetites for tuna in the luxury Asian, European and US markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not just about saving some fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lives and economies of Pacific Islanders and Pacific Island nations are in peril as big eye and yellow fin tuna stocks are threatened from overfishing. Pacific communities are at the mercy of unscrupulous foreign fishersand our growing global appetite for tuna is in the grip of unfair andunsustainable fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on delegates at this week's Western and CentralPacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting in Korea to implement measures fora sustainable and profitable fishing industry. TheWCPFC must start putting words into action byagreeing on strong and effective measures. A precautionary and ecosystem-based approach isneeded to preserve the rich marine diversity of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce, protect and reject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be an immediate halving offishing, a closure to fishing in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt; the high seas pockets&lt;/a&gt; and an immediatehalt to the transfer of fish at sea to discourage piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCPFC must ensure decisions are not hijacked againby a small minority of nations that are not acting in the best interestof Pacific people, their valuable tuna resources andthe health of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one last chance to ensure the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks do notface the same fate as bluefin tuna of the Mediterranean. The Commission has to be preparedto face the consequences if negotiations break down to governments andindustry ruthlessly bargaining for the last tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship, the Esperanza, is present in Korea to bear witness tothe WCPFC's decisions, which will dictate the future of Pacific tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea should lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have joined forces with Korean environmental group KFEM to ensure that Korea, as the host nation and key player in the fishery, takes the lead in making sure that this meeting takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need marine reserves which will fully protect the most vulnerable breeding grounds of the tuna from exploitation. We need sustainable management measures outside those areas that will secure a future for this fishery and for the future of the millions of Pacific island people that depend on this resource for their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow we need marine reserves today. Join the call for a global network of marine reserves protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to attend meetings like this one in Korea to pressure governments who need to make the right decisions to protect our planet. We don't take any corporate or government donations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UN climate negotiations begin in Poznan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/un-climate-conference/</url><text>
	It has been a year since governments in Bali pledged to nail down an agreement to save the climate by December 2009. That means they have one year left to agree on how to stop the climate crisis. This year’s UN meeting on Climate Change has just started in Poznan, Poland and we think it is about time for government leaders to stop the talking, get serious and start real negotiations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/get-serious-quit-coal-greenp.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/get-serious-quit-coal-greenp.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real climate action means quitting our addiction to coal. It's time to get serious.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest destruction costs the world economy at least 2 trillion dollars annually. Ocean fish stocks are collapsing, putting a basic source of food for 3 billion people at risk. Droughts and forest fires are destroying our planet's most precious resources and rising sea levels are threatening to displace hundreds of millions of people before the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn't all bad news, the good news is that the solution is pretty simple: to avoid runaway climate change, the world needs to quit its addiction to coal and stop destroying forests - and that work has to start in Poznan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start investing in a future we can all believe in. We need investments in clean, renewable energy and an end to subsidies for dirty and dangerous energy like coal and nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Rescue Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some government leaders have proven that they cannot be trusted to take swift action on climate change based on the facts. From the coal mines of Konin, to the meeting rooms at the UN meetings in Poznan, we are taking action to make sure that government leaders know it is time to get serious about climate change and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  &lt;a title="QUIT COAL" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/"&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/a&gt; has set up a &lt;a title="CLIMATE RESCUE STATION" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/climate-rescue/"&gt;Climate Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; in Konin, Poland- one hour form the UN meeting - to highlight the true cost of coal in the lead up to crucial UN climate negotiations. The Rescue Station is currently set up on the edge of an open pit coal mine where activists have been demanding an end to our addiction to coal in a series of direct actions. On 8 December, a week into the talks, the dome will be moved to Poznan town square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that the truth is heard at the UN meetings, we've also sent a team of climate experts to Poznan. We are there to pressure governments to quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate. Our message to delegates is simple - it's time to get serious about tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not just another meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year doesn't seem like a lot of time to most of us, considering the scope of the problem. After two decades of climate negotiations, governments are still tip-toeing around each other when it comes to real solutions to climate change. This year the world is watching the UN negotiations and demanding that governments make good on their promise to come up with an action plan in Copenhagen next year. Be a part of the action and &lt;a title="THE WORLD IS WATCHING" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;upload your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the UN meeting in Poznan, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's what we need from our leaders in Poznan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Developed countries must agree greenhouse gas emission reduction targets at the upper end of 25-40%, as identified by the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Make sure government leaders know that The World is Watching and we expect them to commit to a climate deal at next year's talks in Copenhagen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely donations from individuals like you. We don't accept money from governments of corporations.Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	People across the world took to the streets for a Global Day of Action on Saturday, to tell the governments meeting in Poznan, Poland for crucial UN climate negotiations, that the world is watching them.

            Greenpeace activists in India, taking part in the 2008 Global Day of Action for the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 23 countries from Australia to Italy to Mexico to the Philippines to Turkey to the US joined or led a series of protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that Ministers arriving in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/un-climate-conference/"&gt; Poznan&lt;/a&gt; listen to the will of their citizens, and get serious about climate action. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YM806Vheo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the action day in Poznan itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world is watching governments in Poznan" said Mareike Britten, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner. "Saturday's actions clearly show that people across the world recognise that it's time for governments to get serious about climate action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a flash mob of people in swimming gear in Amsterdam, to protests in Red Square, Moscow to banner messages on Aztec pyramids in Mexico, to installing solar panels in Thailand, and giving a solar powered Parol (a Filipino Christmas lantern) to the Philippine senate, to a giant postcards reading "Dear World Leaders, we are ready to save the climate" in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, to a boat protest on the Ganga River in India, our map below highlights key Greenpeace activities across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Representatives of millions of Greenpeace supporters from around the world arrived at the doorstep of the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo today to demand an end to the political persecution of two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, and an end to Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean. Embassy actions are scheduled around the world today and tomorrow.

            A "living statue" of Lady justice protests on behalf of Greenpeace in front of the Japanese embassy in The Hague, Netherlands.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-defendants include the chief whale-defenders (officially, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/whaling-on-trial-120508/about-the-co-defendants/"&gt; Executive Directors&lt;/a&gt;) of Greenpeace offices from Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil, USA and the Nordic countries, as well as Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Condemned by Amnesty International&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the group  declared themselves 'co-defendants' in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki. The two Greenpeace activists exposed corruption in the taxpayer-funded whaling industry, but were themselves &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; arrested in a crackdown on Greenpeace itself in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a million Greenpeace supporters wrote to the Prime Minister to demand their release. The arrest was &lt;a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/japan-must-respect-rights-of-detained-greenpeace-activists-20080715" target="_blank"&gt;denounced by Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, and fits a pattern of repression of the rights of free speech in Japan which has been condemned by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group challenged the Prime Minister to set Junichi and Toru free, and end the corrupt whaling programme, or order their own arrest for daring to oppose the whaling programme. 30,000 people have also &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;signed petitions declaring themselves complicit in Junichi and Toru's actions&lt;/a&gt;, and stated that if defending whales is a crime, they too are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want Prime Minister Aso to know that if Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are to be tried for exposing whale meat embezzlement and working to endthe killing of whales in the Japanese Government's 'research' programmein the Southern Ocean, then we should all be arrested," said JunHoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "It's not Greenpeace activists who should be put on trial; it is the government-backed  whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a Greenpeace undercover investigation in May 2008 that exposed the embezzlement of whale meat from the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet, Japanese authorities responded with a politically-motivated prosecution, arresting Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki and raiding the Greenpeace Japan office in June 2008. They have now been awaiting trial for 172 days under bail conditions which prevent hem from continuing their Greenpeace campaign work to end whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to begin early next year; they are both facing upto 10 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-us"&gt;events will be happening throughout today and tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; at Japanese embassies in Brazil, USA, New Zealand, Argentina, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Canada,  Italy and on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, activists declared themselves as 'co-defendants', by asking the Japanese government to "Arrest Me Too" and to put "Whaling on Trial".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proof of life after whaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart, in Tokyo to support the TokyoTwo and the campaign to end Japan's whaling, was a master and gunner atthe Cheynes Beach Whaling Station in Western Australia until it ceasedoperation in 1978 - following Greenpeace protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm here to assure whalers that there is life after whaling. Japan'swhaling programme is a taxpayer-funded government enterprise, so when it finally ends, it's the responsibility of the Japanese government and theFisheries Agency to retrain the crews for other, sustainable, work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Australia alone, 300 million Australian dollars are made every year fromwhalewatching - hundreds of times more than was ever made by the whalingindustry", said Hart. "I am proud of my time at sea, but it was 30 yearsago. Times have changed, and the world has moved on - whaling no longerhas a place in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We're all Junichi and Toru&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know the story of Spartacus? He was the leader of a slave revolt in ancient Rome.  When soldiers put down the uprising, the Romans demanded to know which of the slaves was Spartacus.  One by one, each slave stood up to declare that he was Spartacus, masking their leader's true identiy and declaring their unity with his cause.  &lt;/p&gt;

	Shameless. Disastrous. The international body responsible for "managing" what's left of the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna stock has ignored scientific advice, the demands of Greenpeace supporters around the world, and the pleas of the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa and the United States to save the fishery from collapse.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Captive Bluefin Tuna inside a transport cage.Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the Mediterranean to protect bluefin tuna with marine reserves in their breeding and feeding areas.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt;Bluefin tuna is highlyprized in Asian markets as sushi, and overfishing has decimated thestocks. Bluefin are slow to mature and many young tuna are caughtbefore they have the chance to reproduce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greenpeace and other environmental groups have called for the closure of the bluefin tuna fisheries, to give them time to recover. But the governments responsible for managing the fishery are refusing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), concluded in Marrakech with an agreement allowing over 22,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna to be landed -- around 7,500 tonnes over the level recommended by scientists to avoid the collapse of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last-chance tuna bazaar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fall under the 'management' of ICCAT, a body made up of government representation from 45 countries plus the European Community.&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But this year's session looked more like a bazaar, in which buyers haggled over the last remaining tuna, than an international meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management plan they agreed to fails to protect the spawning population and merely shortens  the purse seine fishing season, responsible for the bulk of illegal catches, by 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union, representing the majority of Mediterranean countries with interests in the bluefin tuna fishery, bullied other parties in the meeting into agreeing to management proposals which completely fail to follow the advice of ICCAT's own scientific body to substantially reduce fishing and protect the species' spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure from the European countries has been so strong that they have even managed to slow downthe 'payback' for the illegal catches made in the region in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Time for new management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"The game is over - ICCAT has missed its last chance to save the bluefin tuna from stock collapse," said Sebastian Losada, Greenpeace Spain Oceans Campaigner, who has been attending the Marrakech meeting. "Bluefin tuna has become an endangered species because of ICCAT mismanagement. It's time to take the fishery out of their hands and look to Conventions like CITES to impose trade restrictions on thespecies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"These past seven days have demonstrated that ICCAT is a farce," said Losada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;In 2006, following years of extremely high levels of pirate fishing, among others by European Union fishing vessels, ICCAT agreed a bluefin tuna "recovery plan" that set a 'Total Allowable Catch' of 29,500 tonnes for the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;ICCAT's own Scientific Committee recommended a sustainable limit of 15,000 tonnes. Since then, the very same scientists have estimated that actual bluefin tuna catches were about 61,000 tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; Greenpeace demanded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; a closure of the fishery&lt;/a&gt; until a proper recovery plan is inplace including at a very minimum a Total Allowed Catch (TAC) in line with the scientific advice, a seasonal closure covering the months of May, June and July and the establishment of marine reserves to protect the bluefin tuna spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Disgrace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the main fishing countries such as Spain and France, which currently leads the Union of 27 Member States, should bear the brunt of the criticism for this shameful outcome. They have again placed short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species, and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently released performance review of ICCAT written by a panel of experts appointed by ICCAT itself recommended&lt;em&gt; "the suspension of fishing on bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" and&lt;/em&gt; states that "&lt;em&gt;the management ... of this bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is widely seen as an international disgrace.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, ICCAT has lived up to that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

	Peaceful protesters from the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station were attacked by mine workers when they entered the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine. As the activists prepared to paint a huge "Stop" sign next to a giant excavator they were assaulted and prevented from carrying out their peaceful protest. A journalist accompanying the activists was beaten. Local people are also against the expansion of this mine, because it threatens their homes and livelihoods. 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/climate-rescue-station-3.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Climate Rescue Station overlooks the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our action is not against the miners but it is addressed to the Polish government. We demand that the forthcoming Polish energy policy contain a concrete plan for quitting coal and implementing renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also object to opening any new power plants working for lignite. Lignite is the most destructive fuel," says Magdalena Zowsik, Climate and Energy Campaigner in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists at the mine are part of the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station, which was set up two weeks ago at the edge of the mine to bear witness to the destruction and environmental devastation caused by coal. Just last week 400 members of local communities whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by the mine joined us in a peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More then 90 percent of energy in Poland is produced by burning coal, but it doesn't have to be that way. The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution scenario for Poland shows how Poland can make the transition to generating 80 percent of its power using renewable sources. That would mean an end to the destructive mining and devastated countryside that scars Poland. It would also mean Poland would cease to be one of the twenty largest emitters of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland's addiction to coal doesn't just harm its environment, it also drives its role in international talks. With the EU just days away form sealing a deal on a response to climate change Poland is actively trying to water down the package so it can carry on polluting. With Poland also due to host the UN Climate Negotiations on December 1 it is essential that Poland adopts a progressive attitude toward the talks and make itself part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Poland and the world need an energy revolution, not more of the same," adds Zowsik. "The science is unequivocal, if we try to continue burning coal we will do untold damage to the planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, Greenpeace wants to see governments agree a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40 percent cuts, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by the time the next round of climate talks begin in Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three hundred and forty Greenpeace activists were arrested as they took their demand to "Bail out the Planet" to European Union finance ministers in Brussels.

            Hundreds of activists were arrested as they demanded EU finance ministers "Bail out the planet."
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked the exits of the building where the ministers
were meeting, and demanded an answer on the climate funding
question. Swarms of uniformed officers, riot police and
plain-clothed cops descended on the activists as a line of black
armoured vehicles, police vans and busses moved in to block the
public view of the activist-guarded doors. Electric saws were used
to cut through the locks and police dragged activists face down
into the line of police vehicles. It took the police more than two
hours to remove all of the peaceful activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the men and women of EU finance met to discuss the financial
crisis and the climate crisis, we asked a question: where is the
money to avert runaway climate change? Because it looks to us like
there's far more interest in bailing out banks then in bailing out
a planet headed toward a bankrupt future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions made today by EU finance ministers are important
because they will directly influence Europe's position at the
historic UN climate summit in Copenhagen this December. Richer
developed countries need to contribute at least €110 billion a year
by 2020 to make sure developing countries are able to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable
impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country's contribution towards a climate bailout plan is
based on its ability to pay and its level of responsibility in
causing climate change. Based on this, the  European governments'
share is €35 billion a year by 2020, the equivalent of just €1.30 a
week per European citizen: the price of a bus ticket.  To help
raise these funds, we are supporting a new scheme that puts a price
tag on greenhouse gas emissions and asks rich countries to pay for
their carbon footprint according to their means and their
responsibility for causing the climate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

their were no serious injuries sustained. View video from the

<item><language>en</language><title>Stop nuclear madness, end MOX shipments now </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stop-nuclear-madness-no-more/</url><text>
	The largest shipment of deadly plutonium in history is about to leave the French port of Cherbourg - final destination Japan. We’ve taken action to send the message that this is yet another glaring example of the unacceptable risks posed by nuclear energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A target symbol projected onto a truck loaded with plutonium in MOX fuel. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists in France have tracked the shipment which contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in Mixed-Oxide (MOX) fuel. This is enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated &lt;a href="http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/na-bomb/museum/museume01.html"&gt; Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've demonstrated with distress flares and "Stop Plutonium" banners at the Cherbourg port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We projected a "target" symbol and "Nuclear Madness made in France" onto the nearby state owned AREVA reprocessing plant in La Hague, where the MOX was produced. Our activists also projected the same messages onto the trucks carrying the deadly cargo to Cherbourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our position is simple. The world needs an immediate ban on MOX shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ships, the Pacific Heron and Pacific Pintail will be used to transport the radioactive cargo. They will leave on March 6, just after departure AREVA will reveal which route the deadly waste will take to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mox - a deadly fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest dangers of plutonium is that it can be used to make nuclear weapons. MOX increases the dangers of nuclear proliferation, as the plutonium in it is easier to extract for weapons use than plutonium in spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also plenty of evidence showing that the containers used to transport the MOX are not strong enough to withstand serious accidents or terrorist attack. Risk of fire is just one example, the containers are only tested over a few hours, but fires on board ships can last much longer (days or even weeks).  Once MOX fuel disperses it poses a grave threat to public health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a plutonium shipment in 2002, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda stated "our small states are fearful that a deliberate act of terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence. This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all this, it is little wonder that plutonium and MOX shipments have been opposed by dozens of governments and their citizens, since they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AREVA is denying the risks of proliferation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AREVA denies that there is any proliferation risk by claiming a false distinction between "military grade" and "civil grade" nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) thinks differently classifying commercial plutonium MOX fuel as Category 1 nuclear material, requiring the highest level of security protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the world now has more weapons usable plutonium in civil nuclear programmes than in all nuclear weapons arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the Japan's Citizens Nuclear Information Center and Green Action organisations we've &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/Open-letter-ElBaradei"&gt; written to Mohammed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, head of the IAEA warning him that AREVA is either dangerously confused, or is deliberately misrepresenting the proliferation threat posed by the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also sent &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/open-letter-en-route-countries/"&gt; letters to the governments&lt;/a&gt; of  countries that may be en route, warning them of the potential dangers to their populations and environment; and urging them to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/3/mox-map-route.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25048/moxmap-thumb.jpg" alt="moxmap.jpg" width="430" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The most likely route of the MOX shipment is via South Africa and across the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia, and through the coastal waters of South Pacific nations. Other possible routes are via the Caribbean and Panama Canal or via South America and Cape Horn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan has been failing to use MOX for their nuclear reactors for over a decade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has been trying to use MOX in their nuclear reactors for more than ten years; and have repeatedly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shipment to Japan in 1999 ended in fiasco after the producer, UK state company British Nuclear Fuels, admitted it had deliberately falsified vital quality control safety data. After an 18,000-mile voyage, the rejected fuel was shipped back to the UK. Two more cargoes, one delivered in 1999, the other in 2001, were opposed by local citizens and regional governments. Both shipments remain in storage with no prospect that they will ever be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough already, stop the Nuclear madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as though anything has changed. Shipping MOX remains as dangerous as ever. Governments across the world have recognised the threat and in 2005 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/MIM/A-conf.207-L.6-Mauritius%20Declaration.pdf"&gt; a moratorium on all nuclear transports&lt;/a&gt; was tabled at a UN summit. It's time to make that resolution a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the best efforts of the nuclear industry to convince us otherwise, the simple truth is that you can't separate "civil" nuclear from nuclear used for weapons. They are two parts of the same extremely dangerous whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for industry claims that nuclear power can be used in the fight against climate change, the opposite is true. Nuclear power is too little, too late, too dangerous. In fact, it &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25048/nuclear-power-undermining-cl.pdf"&gt; undermines the true solutions to climate change&lt;/a&gt; by diverting urgently needed resources away from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be following the MOX shipment on our &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/"&gt;nuclear reaction blog&lt;/a&gt;, sign up for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EXPOSED! Pirates bankrolled by Spanish government</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-pirates-bankrolled-by/</url><text>
	We've just presented evidence to the Fisheries Committee of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) that the Spanish company Vidal Armadores S. A., despite being involved in pirate fishing, received over 3.5 million Euros in Spanish government subsidies. On top of that, the company is still getting help from the Spanish government in securing contracts and licences to fish in other countries. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real pirates get punished, right? Aarrgh, not in Spain, matey! There they get subsidised.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;Pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; - known by its less colourful name: illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing -&lt;/span&gt; costs the world US$4 billion annually and &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;leaves communities that depend on fish without much needed food and income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;In the Southern Pacific, pirate fishing for the prized Patagonia toothfish (also known as "sea bass") has driven the species to the brink of commercial extinction. &lt;/span&gt;Illegal fleets catching the remaning toothfish here are predominantly controlledby northern hemisphere transnational crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off the radar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is currently running a fleet of at least five vessels in the Southern Ocean, at least three of which are blacklisted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Commission - part of the Antarctic TreatySystem - manages fishing activities in the Southern Ocean. It blacklists vessels for engaging in pirate activity or failing to respect conservation measures, and the 24 member states agree not to buy fish from blacklisted vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a blacklisted vessel transfers its catch at sea to another ship, who is to know? In 2007, CCAMLR estimated that pirate vessels caught more than 3600 tonnes of toothfish and killed more than 8000 seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, New Zealand inspectors documented that the Namibian-flagged &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/0/vessel/show/156-paloma-v"&gt;Paloma V&lt;/a&gt; had been involved in &lt;a href="http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Features/945-Illegal-Fishing-activities.php"&gt; illegal transshipments&lt;/a&gt;. It was blacklisted by CCAMLR as a result. The inspection revealed that the vessel was operating together with other ships in the Vidal fleet including the blacklisted North Korean-flagged Chilbo San 33 and Black Moon, as well as the Spanish-flagged Belma and Galaecia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Spain signed an agreement with Namibia in 2008 that gave the Belma access to Namibian fishing grounds, and has provided Vidal Armadores with other assistance in securing contracts and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hook them and book them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on all countries participating in the Committee on Fisheries in Rome to take the evidence presented to them seriously and urgently work towards closing the loopholes that these operators use to avoid controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is not alone - fishing companies around the world use transshipments and loopholes to evade the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need bodies like the UN FAO to support strong regulations involving the ports that these ships enter, create a global record of fishing vessels and to urgently reduce commercial fishing to a sustainable level. It is simply a matter of political will to deliver the kind of enforcement that is needed to protect the marine environment and the communities which depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the case of Vidal Armadores, we want to see the Spanish government take real action to stop ocean plunder - they can start by asking for their subsidies back. Then they can prosecute any Spanish nationals that were captains or masters of the ships. Then they can revoke all Vidal Armadores' licenses and stop helping them get contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves to protect the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>India's light bulb phase out: setting a smart example</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/india-light-bulb-phaseout-250209/</url><text>
	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Undercover operation exposes illegal dumping of e-waste in Nigeria </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-nigeria180209/</url><text>
	Following a three-year undercover investigation, we’ve shown once again that electronic waste - like your old TV set - still isn't being responsibly recycled like it's supposed to be. Instead, e-waste is being disguised as second-hand goods and shipped off to Nigeria, where it is sold, scrapped or illegally dumped. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            E-waste is one of the fastest growing types of hazardous waste with up to 80 percent of e-waste from Europe failing to be disposed of safely
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover operation, carried out with the help of &lt;a title="Sky News" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Sky-Probe-Reveals-Recycling-Scandal-As-Broken-TVs-Are-Shipped-Over-To-West-Africa/Article/200902315224628?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15224628_Sky_Probe_Reveals_Recycling_Scandal_As_Broken_TVs_Are_Shipped_Over_To_West_Africa"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt;, is further evidence of the growing trade in hazardous waste from Europe to the developing world due to  electronic companies' failure to take responsibility for recycling their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on a tip-off, we launched our operation to see just where some electronic waste was ending up. We took an unfixable TV, fitted it with a tracking device and brought it to the UK's Hampshire County Council for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being safely dismantled in the UK or Europe, like it should have been, the Council's 'recycling' company, BJ Electronics, passed it on as 'second-hand goods' and it was shipped off to Nigeria to be sold or scrapped and dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following the e-waste trail - a Greenpeace investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's illegal to export broken electronic goods under EU legislation - at no point before it was crammed into a container with similar TVs and shipped off was the TV turned on or tested to see if it was in working condition. We followed the complete e-waste trafficking route by hiding a tracking device inside the TV that provided location updates via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/02/illegal_ewaste_export_to_niger.html"&gt; Read more&lt;/a&gt; about how exactly we tracked the TV all the way to Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, like &lt;a title="Ghana" href="/international/en/news/features/poisoning-the-poor-electroni/"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Pakistan" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/scrap-life-pakistan-with-rob"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="India" href="/international/en/publications/reports/recyclingelectronicwasteindiachinafull/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="China" href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-e-waste-exposed140708/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, is just one of many destinations that Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other developed countries are using as toxic e-waste dumping grounds. For years, we've been exposing the mountains of e-waste that show up on the doorstep of developing countries at the expense of people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest people, in many cases children, are put to work breaking apart TVs, mobile phones, game consoles and other electronic items that arrive in their tonnes. With no safety measures, they are exposed to highly toxic chemicals, including mercury, which damages the brain; lead, which can damage reproductive systems; and cadmium, which causes kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is your e-waste going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we were able to track the e-waste from door to door, exposing the loopholes in recycling programmes that allow illicit profits to be made by the developed world's traders by dumping their obsolete and hazardous electronics abroad instead of properly recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of old electronic goods and components leave the EU for Africa every day, despite regulations prohibiting the trade in e-waste. Some will be repaired and reused, but many are beyond repair, meaning that they will eventually be dumped in places where no facilities exist for safe recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by making sure their goods are free from hazardous components. We need them to take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that poison people and the environment across the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

	If we are to avert catastrophic climate change the world must quit coal. But, the industry and the powerful forces which rely on it will not go down without a fight. Today, in Warsaw, Greenpeace, provided them with two reminders of why we should quit coal. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tell major global polluters in Poland to "Get Serious, Quit Coal".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists dumped coal on the doorstep of a luxury Warsaw hotel, where industry ministers from 20 countries are meeting to discuss coal's future, unveiling a banner saying 'Get serious, quit coal!'. Greenpeace has also published a report on the "True Cost of Coal": estimating the annual financial costs of coals' climate impact, health impact and the cost of deadly mining accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the Polish Government, the conference documents claim that the meeting is being held to agree on policies to help the climate - but the agenda reveals it is about saving profits, not the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background documents on the 'Summit on Sectoral Cooperation,' describe coal as the main fuel for power generation in the future and discuss "adequate policy actions."  The documents hold up the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as a "spectacular" example of good policy initiatives on climate protection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this partnership is just a coal pact - an agreement by some of the world's leading polluters to do nothing in particular, by no particular time and in no particular way.  In the face of catastrophic climate change that's worse than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Cost of Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with this meeting is the release of our report "The True Cost of Coal", which describes the costs coal imposes on society. Produced in conjunction with the independent Dutch Institute CE Delft, the report puts a price tag on some of the more obvious damages caused along the coal chain-of-custody, including climate change, health impacts from air pollution and loss of life from mining accidents.  Last year, these damages cost the world at least 360 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all the costs of coal can be measured in dollars and cents. In Columbia, indigenous communities are threatened and forced off their lands to make way for coal mines; thousands in Jharia, India, suffer from horrendous living conditions because of uncontrollable coal fires; in Russia, unsafe mining conditions have meant injury and death for scores of workers. We tell twelve of these stories in our report, but there are thousands more to be found wherever coal is mined or burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places like Indonesia, China and Thailand, air pollution from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, damaging ancient relics, reducing crop yields and killing people. The legacy of mining ensures that land in South Africa will continue to be poisoned by acid mine drainage long after mines are closed. Iin the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland, mining activities have caused the water level of Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically. In the United States coal has meant blowing up mountains, burying streams and contaminating nearby communities. In Germany, reclaiming opencast mines has created dead lakes with water as acid as vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in response to the unmitigated destruction and harm caused by coal, communities are rising up.  In Australia, winemakers, horse breeders, local residents and miners are saying no to mine expansion and yes to a just transition to renewable energy.  In the Philippines, a diverse group has united to oppose a new coal-fired power station, calling instead for clean energy development.  Stories such as these inspire, provide hope and point towards a better future - one not marred by dirty coal but fuelled by energy sources that are safe, sustainable and will protect our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is days away from sealing a deal on its own response to climate change, with a series of laws known as the 'climate package', which should provide a boost to renewable energy and reduce Europe's reliance on coal.  The European position will have a massive bearing on global negotiations to strengthen the successor to the Kyoto Protocol, culminating in Copenhagen at the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25082/true-cost-of-coal-report-launc.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poland threatens climate package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is currently threatening to block the EU package. Despite a recent report  showing that implementing the proposed climate package would benefit the Polish economy, vested interests have convinced the Polish government otherwise. Poland generates 90% of its power from burning coal, and the industry has convinced the government that their interests come before those of the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why there won't be any representatives from the renewable industry attending the Sheraton shindig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future without coal is not only possible, it is necessary if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change. The most effective way to do this is for the world to work together under one agreement. Poland, host of the upcoming climate talks, in Poznan, could have designed a meeting to help progress towards an environmentally effective global agreement on climate protection rather than one likely to hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're calling on all countries at the UN climate negotiations next week to get serious and put a meaningful proposal on the table. The proposal must include a "climate vision" which will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40%, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Time To Lead" href="http://www.timetolead.eu/" target="_blank"&gt;Tell EU Leaders to defend the climate package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>First fin whales killed in Iceland </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/first-fin-whales-killed-in-ice/</url><text>
	The whaling boat Hvalur 9 dragged two massive fin whales up to the ancient whaling station ramp at Hvalförður in the early hours. If it were not for Iceland’s midnight sun the whalers would have been sneaking in under the cover of the night – a scene befitting the shameful hunt that can only do untold damage to Iceland’s reputation.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            June 19, 2009 HVALFJORDUR-FJORD, ICELANDWhaling in Iceland. First fin whales brought to land on June 19, 2009. The boat, Hvalur 9, entering Hvalfjordur-fjord. The first fin whale to be cut was a female, 18 metres long.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales were killed on Friday morning, just days before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings begin in Madeira, Portugal. The start of the hunt was clearly intended to deride efforts to modernise the Commission and stop the needless slaughter of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales are the first of 150 fin whales Icelandic whaler Kristjan Loftsson plans to hunt this year, despite having no domestic market for the meat and &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/no-market-for-icelandic-whale/"&gt; no interest from importers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The hunt is part of a 5 year whaling programme agreed by the former Icelandic government, just hours before it collapsed earlier this year. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists fin whales as an endangered species globally that requires special protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland's new government "fallen asleep" on the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland's new government under Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir has openly voiced its opposition to whaling. Yet, by failing to stop the hunt it appears to have fallen asleep on the issue and allowed the whalers to dictate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has not only failed to stop the controversial fin whale hunt from going ahead. It is also failing to stop a hunt of minke whales that started in May. Shockingly, the minkes are being hunted in the same areas as those visited by whale watching trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not taking action to stop the hunts, the new government risks squandering a real chance to save Iceland's environmental and international reputation, as well as hopes for speedy accession to the pro-conservation Europe Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No market for whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no domestic whale meat market in Iceland. Loftsson justifies the hunt by promising to sell the meat to Japan, claiming it can help Iceland recover from its economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently showed that this is absolute hogwash, when we released audio and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fact-sheet-the-whale-meat-mar/"&gt; an English transcript&lt;/a&gt; of a very interesting conversation we had with the Japanese trader who imported fin and minke whale meat from Iceland and Norway last year. The head of the Asia Trading Company in Tokyo told us very clearly that he will not take any more in the future, because there is no market for the whale meat in Japan. In fact, he only took it last year as a favour to Loftsson because he is a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland hunt starts on eve of IWC meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fin whale hunt has started just before the IWC meets in Madeira, Portugal. The blatant disregard displayed by the Icelandic whalers for international agreements, economics and the environment is a prime example of why the IWC needs to put its own house in order and become an effective conservation body that works for whales, not whalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a perfect setting for such change. In 1981, Portugal moved to protect all whales and dolphins throughout its territories, ending the island's long association with whaling. Madeira's fast-growing whale watching industry proves once again that whales are worth much more alive than dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icleand is well positioned to follow this example. More than 115,000 people have already taken our Iceland Pledge, saying they would visit the country, and go whale watching, if the government ends whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests.

&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;For the sake of biodiversity, indigenous peoples' rights and the climate, I support Greenpeace's call to cut emissions – not trees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>France's Nuclear Failures</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/frances-nuclear-failures-020209/</url><text>
	Hazardous waste, illegitimate and dangerous new reactors and a diversion to the solutions to climate change - here's why France's picture of nuclear energy is just a 'great illusion'.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace in action at the construction site of the European Pressurised Reactor in Flamanville, France. Greenpeace is demanding an immediate end to construction at both Flamanville and Europe's other EPR site at Olkiluoto, Finland, calling the plants dangerous, unnecessary and uneconomic.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the French government's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) as cheap and safe, nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity, and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever-increasing problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has recently uncovered evidence that nuclear waste from the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) - the flagship of the French nuclear industry - will be up to &lt;strong&gt;seven times more hazardous&lt;/strong&gt; than waste produced by existing nuclear reactors, increasing costs and the danger to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming evidence was buried away in the &lt;a href="http://www.posiva.fi/publications/Posiva_YVA_selostusraportti_en_lukittu.pdf"&gt; environmental impact assessment report&lt;/a&gt; from Posiva, the company responsible for managing waste at the world's first EPR under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland, and in &lt;a href="http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e_ntb04-08.pdf"&gt; EU-funded research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expensive and hazardous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR is designed to extract more energy from nuclear fuel than any commercially operating reactor in order to maximise electricity output. This "high burn-up" method causes the amount of readily-released radioactive substances in spent fuel to increase disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of the hazardous waste will be more costly for a range of reasons - including an increase in the repository size due to the greater distance needed between canisters, more extensive and longer-term monitoring being necessary, and increased security being required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…not only will spent nuclear fuel produced by the EPR be more dangerous than is acknowledged by the French nuclear industry, but also storage and disposal will be more expensive than the industry and governments proclaim and will increase the overall cost of nuclear energy. The French nuclear companies Areva and EDF, which aggressively market the EPR as safe and cheap, have completely ignored the implications of the increased &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;hazards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Large, independent nuclear consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No appropriate waste facilities exist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- or are even being planned - in Finland, France or any of the countries considering buying the EPR (including the UK, the US, Canada and India). In Finland, plans for burying the nuclear waste that are awaiting approval are simply inadequate for preventing interim and long-term health risks, and will pass on huge financial liabilities to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Illegitimate and dangerous"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR construction project in Olkiluoto has been &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-the-french-reactor/"&gt; hampered by all manner of chronic problems, delays and cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposed to have been completed by April 2009, but now faces at least three years' delay - its cost has doubled to over €5 billion and serious construction and safety problems have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same mistakes have plagued a second EPR construction at Flamanville, France, which started just over a year ago. It too is now delayed - by nine months at present - and is already running at over 20 percent of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, President Sarkozy &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/illegitimate-and-dangerous-reactor-300109/"&gt; announced last week that a new EPR is to be built in Penly&lt;/a&gt;, France. Greenpeace believes that building yet another reactor under these circumstances is entirely illegitimate and simply dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penly decision was taken without any public consultation, open bidding or analysis of energy needs. No other options, such as energy efficiency or renewable energy potential, were considered, no comparisons were made in terms of costs, environmental impacts or needs; in fact, the official study analysing France's electricity needs beyond 2020 is still ongoing, so there is nothing to justify the decision to pour vast amounts of money into building another problematic reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its only justification is to provide a massive contract to the state-owned industry. In these times of fiscal crisis, however, it is crucial to make the right choices: and investment instead in renewable energy would provide not only climate protection and cleaner energy, but more and better jobs and a truly sustainable state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The great illusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when France is setting itself up as the political and industrial champion of a supposed worldwide expansion of nuclear power, Global Chance - an  association that includes among its members several of France's few independent nuclear experts - has produced a report that shows how France's nuclear promises are a dangerous illusion. France is locked into nuclear power in a way that presents an obstacle to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Chance report shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France's nuclear programme fails to rise to the challenges of climate change and energy security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France has not benefited economically from their 'all electric, all nuclear' approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how nuclear power is liable to suffer serious accidents - whether due to system failure, natural disaster or deliberate attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how no satisfactory solution has been found for the management of long-term waste; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France contributes to proliferation, which remains a major risk for global security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace briefing &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/frances-nuclear-failures-report/"&gt; &lt;em&gt;France's Nuclear Failures - The great illusion of nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; summarises the lessons that can be drawn from the Global Chance report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy [R]evolution!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is nothing more than an out-of-date, expensive and failed technology from the last century. It undermines the solutions to climate change by diverting urgently-needed resources away from the true renewable and energy-efficiency solutions that governments who are serious about climate change need to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy [R]evolution blueprint&lt;/a&gt; shows that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency can deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050 and ensure that people have a clean energy future that is free from the dangers of hazardous nuclear waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;

	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A Time Comes: What it means to take action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/louder-than-words020609/</url><text>
	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate challenge even greater after UN meeting in Bonn</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonntwo150609/</url><text>
	As another round of Bonn climate talks limps to a close, and the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December this year draws closer and closer, it’s a good opportunity to take a look at the progress that’s been made so far…
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Negotiators at the UN climate talks in Bonn failed to answer the call for emergency action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, almost everything is now on the table. On the minus side, almost everything now on the table is still on the table, and doesn't look likely to be going anywhere fast. In fact, one draft document that was 50 pages long at the start of the Bonn meeting is now closer to 300 pages long. Given that one of the purposes of this meeting was to narrow options down, it's safe to assume that 'progress', therefore, has not been significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money from the industrialised world to help developing countries to switch to clean energy, keep tropical rainforests intact and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts is still missing from the table. But the biggest space of all is where the robust, effective emissions cuts for industrialised countries should be. The science demands that, as a group, these countries need to cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of irreversible climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaders need apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate change issue has to be passed right to the top of the political 'food chain'. Heads of governments must take responsibility for protecting the climate and, in so doing, protecting the planet and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. There's probably not a single ministry or government department that remains untouched by this issue; energy, environment, foreign affairs, treasury - the list goes on. And every single one of them will have its own perspectives and priorities. In every capital city around the world, the person who has the 'big picture' - the person who sits at the desk where the buck ultimately stops - needs to stand up, step up and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next chance for action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, the heads of the world's richest countries will get together in Italy for the G8 Summit. This will be an historical opportunity for these leaders to break the deadlock and send a strong signal of intent by agreeing deep cuts in emissions and putting money on the table for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December around 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish Prime Minister takes step towards EU leadership at UN Climate Summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/TuskCopenhagen04062009/</url><text>
	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A new exhibit in Aomori, Japan, gives a glimpse of Greenpeace history through one of our iconic communication tools: the t-shirt.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Mai Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan and Fanny Lee of Greenpeace China at exhibition of Greenpeace t-shirts in Aomori, Japan, where two Greenpeace activists are on trial.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our campaigns have spawned many, many tees -- from the funny to the shrill, the plain and functional to the artistic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as action tools, as when activists aboard the Greenpeace ship Sirius were being escorted out of the Soviet Union, and in front of whirring cameras revealed the message "Stop Nuclear Testing" in Russian on the t-shirts  beneath their sweatshirts.  Or when activists in the high-security zone around a Star Wars missile test wore "Don't Shoot" tees -- messaging both the missile masters and the gun-toting guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as barter items with border guards, coveted and swapped among ships' crew, and sought after by collectors looking to create a complete timeline of the organisation in organic cotton. When our Japanese office put out the call to Greenpeacers around the world to empty their closets, they got nearly 200 examples of the art of the body billboard from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organiser Mai Suzuki, activist and Greenpeace t-shirt collector, hopes to tell the public about environmental risks and Greenpeace's efforts to tackle them in a simple and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many of us wear T-shirts every day. When you wear a Greenpeace T-Shirt, everyone can look at you on the street. It is a potent and direct way of communicating information," said Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157619186149933&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition also highlights the global support behind the Aomori communications centre, which was set up earlier this year to bring Greenpeace messages directly to people of the port city. Aomori is where Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are currently on trial for intercepting a box of embezzled whale meat, with the aim of exposing a long-standing culture of embezzlement within the government-sponsored whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They succeeded in exposing the scandal, but are now on trial themselves for "theft", despite having given the whale meat to the public prosecutor as evidence for an investigation into the embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition showcases a new t-shirt from Greenpeace UK, which was recently worn by activists during activities supporting Junichi and Tory, known as the "Tokyo Two", in London.  (Nudge, nudge -- you can &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;buy a version of that t-shirt at our online shop&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki hopes that the T-Shirts will show the Japanese public the passion Greenpeace has for its campaigns, and that it inspires them to take action themselves to right environmental wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is my wish that the public come and take a look at the T-Shirts, and realise that they have the power to change the world," said Suzuki.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;When you buy a Greenpeace t-shirt, the proceeds help keep us going. When you wear a Greenpeace t-shirt, you help spread the word about our campaigns. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;T-shirts alone can't keep our ships at sea and our activists free.  Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to campaign for a green and peaceful future. You will make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Two years have passed since world leaders promised all of us a deal to stop climate change. After two weeks of UN negotiations, politicians breezed in, had dinner with the Queen, a three hour lunch, took some photos and then delivered what could only be described as the 24 hour Head of State tourist brochure of Copenhagen instead of a climate treaty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/the-little-mermaid-laments-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Think or Swim!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't believe the hype, there is nothing fair, ambitious or legally binding about this deal. The job of world leaders is not done. Today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/PageFiles/24942/cop15-assessment.pdf"&gt;Click here for a detailed assessment of the Copenhagen Accord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene tonight, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good, to avert catastrophic climate change. What we needed was a legally binding agreement that was fair to developing countries and ambitious when it came to emissions cuts and ending deforestation. In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through. We've seen a year of crises, but today it is clear that the biggest one facing humanity is a leadership crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's to blame?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year, a number of developing countries showed a willingness to accept their share of the burden to avert climate chaos. But in the end, the blame for failure mostly lies with the rich industrialised world, countries which have the largest historic responsibility for causing the problem. In particular, the US failed to take any real leadership and dragged the talks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are saying that we have only a few years left to stop the rise in emissions before making the kind of rapid reductions that would give us the best chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. We cannot change that science, so instead we will have to change the politics - and we may well have to change the politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen million people demanded that world leaders take responsibility and make good on their promise to deliver a real deal to save the climate. World leaders clearly heard us - echoing our messages in many of their own speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not over, people everywhere demanded a real deal before the Summit began and they are still demanding it. We can still save hundreds of millions of people from the devastation of a warming world, but it has just become a whole lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Executive Director and chair of the tcktcktck coalition, Kumi Naidoo said "Civil society, the bulk of which was locked out of the final days of this Climate Summit, now needs to redouble its efforts. Each and every one of us must hold our leaders to account. We must take the struggle to avert climate catastrophe into every level of politics, local, regional, national and international. We also need to take it into the board room and onto the high streets. We can either work for a fundamental change in our society or we can suffer the consequences of one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/me2"&gt;Together with other environmental and social justice groups, we are building the largest movement of civil society the world has ever witnessed. Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Justice is starting to go the Tokyo Two way: A court in Aomori, Japan, has delivered a series of setbacks to the prosecution in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki (the activists known as the Tokyo Two) - and the Japanese government's attempts to cover up an embezzlement scandal within the whaling industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan Campaigns Director Junichi Sato faces up to ten years in prison for exposing corruption in the whaling industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the court has ruled that evidence of the embezzlement scandal cannot be excluded. Second, the issue of whether or not Junichi and Toru's actions are protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can and will be discussed during the trial. Third, the court has requested that the prosecutor come forward with witness testimonies that may prove crucial to the case - and to further disclose evidence of the whale meat scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor had previously been attempting to portray the actions of Junichi and Toru as being a simple case of theft, and to block any discussion of the embezzlement. The court has rightly refused to accept this, ruling that this evidence cannot be excluded - evidence which details the exposure by Junichi and Toru of a major corruption scandal within the Japanese government-sponsored Southern Ocean whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru risk up to ten years in jail if convicted of theft. They removed a box of embezzled whale meat from a mail depot last year, and presented it to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor, who immediately opened up an investigation into corruption in the government-subsidised whaling programme. The investigation was later discontinued - on the same day that Junichi and Toru were arrested, and the Greenpeace Japan office raided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has urged the prosecutor to disclose evidence that he's been holding back. This includes statements made to police by the "owner" of the intercepted box of whale meat;  by several individuals who purportedly entrusted their whale meat to him, and by an employee of whaling fleet operator Kyodo Senpaku, who made the arrangements to transport the crewmembers' "personal luggage" from the ship to their homes. If that sounds murky, it's probably because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this trial, we want to establish that what Junichi and Toru did was to corroborate information provided by whistleblowers regarding embezzlement within the Kyodo Senpaku whaling fleet," said the Tokyo Two's defence lawyer, Yuichi Kaido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the prosecutor's opinion being rejected by the court, we have gained a foothold in this case and the opportunity to prove that there was indeed embezzlement of whale meat by employees."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that prosecutor's attempts to keep the whale meat scandal and several witnesses out of the courtroom, and thus the public eye, has only resulted in making the judges more curious. Maybe it's because the prosecutor knows that the whaling industry really has something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The government was hoping to bury this scandal by putting the messengers on trial," said Jun Hoshikawa, Greenpeace Japan Executive Director. "However, as more evidence of embezzlement comes to light, at the end of the day it will be whaling that is on trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If the Japanese government is going to arrest people for the crime of opposing whaling, they are going to need a lot of handcuffs.  Are you a suspect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us defend the Tokyo Two, and oppose whaling.  Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations. We rely on you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climatepolicy"&gt;Other briefings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Congo's forest protector receives Right Livelihood Award</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/congo-right-livelihood041209/</url><text>
	As Barack Obama prepares to pick up a Peace Prize he's yet to earn, a truly deserving activist collects the Alternative Nobel Prize for his work to save the forests of the Congo.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/rene-ngongo-greenpeace-forest.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/rene-ngongo-greenpeace-forest.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>forests</value><value>congo</value><value>livelihood</value><value>climate</value><value>right</value><value>forests</value></taxonomy><date>2009-12-04 00:00:00</date></item>

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck.

            Parody of the logo of French nuclear fuel company, Areva, manufacturer of the steam generators aboard the Happy Ranger.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our oceans are being plundered by pirates. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing – also known as "pirate fishing" - has become a global scourge. From international waters around the world, to the islands of the South Pacific and the coastal communities of West Africa, fisheries are in crisis.

environment bruised and battered, and undermines food security and
attempts at sustainable management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roll call&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official lists of pirate vessels are limited in the information
they contain and don't include the names of the big companies
behind these pirate fishing vessels. It's time for the truth: for
fish purchasers, retailers, and the public to see who's behind
pirate fishing, and for ship owners to start taking responsibility
in their role. Companies often have illegal and legal vessels
fishing side by side. It is time they pay the real price for piracy
and have all their operations held accountable when caught
pirate-fishing.  We've launched an online database of fishing
vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, and the companies who own them.   &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/" title="Pirate Blacklist"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our IUU blacklist is the first independent record of fishing
vessels, support vessels and companies involved in pirate fishing. 
It includes independent observations from the legal fishing
industry, government authorities, and first-hand evidence from
Greenpeace and other NGOs who have recorded the activities of these
vessels and companies at sea and in ports around the world.  The
new database supplements the existing IUU database that was
launched in 2007, which contained only those pirate fishing vessels
officially blacklisted by regional fisheries management
organisations and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging all retailers and seafood traders to ensure
they do not purchase pirate-caught fish and, as a first step,
ensure that they do not trade with companies listed as operators of
pirate vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest destruction is costing the global economy US $2 to $5 trillion per year — more than Wall Street has lost since the start of the current financial crisis. After stalling for years, the European Commission has finally come out with a proposal for illegal logging legislation and recommendations to tackle deforestation. Unfortunately, the law doesn’t do enough to address deforestation and illegal logging or what it is really costing us.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If the last ancient forests and all the life that’s in them don’t get a little love from the Environmental Ministers they will soon be wiped out. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, more than 125,000 of you wrote to
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, asking him to
show a little &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org//barossoloveletter" title="Forest Love"&gt;Forest Love&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the EU's
massive contribution to deforestation and illegal logging. Your
message got to the EU Commission, their response just doesn't go
far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU forest footprint not getting any smaller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed law won't keep illegal timber out of the EU, or
help you figure out if the flat-pack wardrobe you bought last
Saturday is the result of forest crime. There's no plan to make
sure that businesses prove their wood is legal or to make sure that
forest criminals bringing in illegal timber pay for their crimes.
And while the commission recognises the damage being caused by the
demand for agricultural commodities (such as soy beans, cattle and
palm oil) as a major contributor to deforestation, it doesn't
suggest a plan to eliminate the problem.  It commits only to more
studies and exploring policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of the world's rainforests to make way for
things like more palm oil plantations is driving climate change and
pushing species such as the orang-utan, to the brink of extinction.
Every time the rainforest is trashed, huge amounts of greenhouse
gases are released into the atmosphere. The destruction of our
rainforests accounts for a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions -
that's more than all the planes, trains and cars in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not all bad news, there are parts of the
recommendations that get forest protection right. We are happy to
see a recommendation for the creation of a fund for forest
protection under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The plan itself only provides a fraction of the money
needed for the fund to succeed, so now the Commission needs to
figure out how to make sure the fund can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission also rightly opposes forest offset credits for
the next decade. If forest credits were approved, they could allow
the energy sector to buy its way out of necessary reforms and
emission cuts. The EU Commission is taking a step in the right
direction by rejecting forest credits in the carbon markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European environment ministers are expected to discuss
deforestation at their Council on 4 December and the first
ministerial debate on the timber legislative proposal is expected
to take place at the agriculture Council on 17-19 December.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the last ancient forests and all the life that's in them
don't get a little love from the Environmental Ministers they will
soon be wiped out. If the EU is serious about protecting forests
and keeping temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, then
Parliament and Council need to step it up on the Commission
proposals.  We need a strong timber law and new economic incentives
and financial resources to put an end to deforestation and illegal
logging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A group of Papuanese traditional dancers greets the Esperanza during a welcoming ceremony at Jayapura port.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; arrived in Jayapura, in the Indonesian
province of Papua, to an energetic welcome from a troupe of
traditional dancers, and local dignitaries - including the mayor of
Jayapura - gave their support to our campaign."Forests for Climate"
is not only the slogan for our Paradise Forests tour - it's also
the name of a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forests_for_climate_brochure/" target="_blank"&gt;landmark proposal&lt;/a&gt; Greenpeace has developed,
for an international funding mechanism toprotect tropical
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just completed a six-week tour of neighbouring Papua New
Guinea, the &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; will tour Indonesia starting with the
provinces of Papua and West Papua, which represent the last
frontier of intact ancient forests in the country. Over the next
six weeks, the ship will be touring the archipelago to document the
threats facing the forests of Papua and Sumatra as well as the
companies and politicians responsible. Also, we will be
highlighting the short and long-term solutions to the crisis so
these forests can be permanently protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one half of the remote and mountainous New Guinea island,
Papua contains the largest area of remaining forest in Indonesia -
with those of Sumatra and Kalimantan on the island of Borneo
largely gone or degraded, this really is the last frontier. The
region is home to hundreds of distinct tribes and clans with a
corresponding range of cultural diversity, and for biodiversity is
second to none, with animals and plants new to science being
recorded on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That alone makes the forests worth protecting, but we now
realise they're also vitally important when it comes to climate
change. Not only do the trees and soil act as huge carbon stores,
cutting them down also releases that carbon in the form of
greenhouse gases. Indonesia is the third largest emitter on the
planet, largely due to deforestation and its forests are
disappearing faster than anywhere in the world, so to prevent
climate change we have to save the forests, including those in
Papua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to do this is to place a moratorium on all deforestation
across Indonesia, which will provide the breathing space necessary
to work on plans to safeguard the future of these forests. The
Indonesian government is the one to lay down a moratorium, but it
also needs the palm oil industry to provide ministers the space to
do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/" target="_blank"&gt;the victory with our Dove campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier
this year, we have been working with companies such as Unilever to
build a coalition in favour of an immediate moratorium on forest
conversion for palm oil and insisting their palm oil suppliers do
not clear further forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of climate change are already being felt around the
world and we don't have long to prevent the worst predictions
becoming inevitable. We still have time if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

<item><language>en</language><title>Philips back in the red again</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philips-back-in-the-red161008/</url><text>
	Philips Electronics has long been in the red with a big fat zero on tackling e-waste in our Guide to Greener Electronics. Meanwhile, in Moscow’s Red Square, it is celebrating 110 years in Russia with its annual 'Sense and Simplicity' event. We did a spot of corporate gatecrashing to remind Philips that, after all these years, doing the right thing is still simple: take back and recycle. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Philips stands out as the company with the worst position on e-waste and recycling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips stands out as thebiggest obstacle to tackling the
growing problem of old electronics (e-waste)being dumped in
developing countries. Not that you'll find any reference tosuch
details in Philips' marketing material. That's why we paid a visit
tohighlight the real consequences of Philips' position. In fact, we
discoveredthat never mind simply not mentioning the real truth,
Philips' public materialwas overflowing with elaborate wording
gushing over how responsible, healthyand sustainable Philips
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Circle of irresponsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a copyof Philips' greenwashed press packet in a trash
bin. It claims Philips' eventis all about a healthy lifestyle and
maintaining a sustainableenvironment. It talks about
responsibleconsumption and a shopping experience it calls the
"Circle of Life." Philipsclaims the concepts and products presented
at the event are about itscommitment to "health and well-being of
people across the globe" and to"collective well-being, and helping
to create a sustainable global society toprotect our environment
for future generations."&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If this is the case, then why does
Philipsfail to take back and recycling it products globally in
contrast to manycompetitors like Dell and Nokia? Why does it refuse
to accept the real costs oftheir own e-waste? Instead, Philips
promotes and actively lobbies forgovernments and public to
subsidise recycling its e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unhealthy People, Unhealthy Living, Unhealthy Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips should takeresponsibility for its own products. If it is
really interested in a"sustainable global society", it should make
sure all of its products are collectedand not leave the burden of
cleaning up toxic e-waste on unprotected workers.E-waste can end up
in countries without recycling facilities and the recyclingworkers
treating the waste - often children - are exposed to a cocktail
oftoxic chemicals and poisons when the products are broken
apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unprotected workers in thee-waste dumps of China, India,
Pakistan and Ghana who end up dismantlingPhilips products are a
world away from Philips' 'Sense and Sensibility'marketing, but that
doesn't change the fact that Philips is the company whoseposition
is blocking real solutions to the problem. Watch the snap shot
ofpersonal stories of e-waste workers in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words healthy and sustainable certainly don't spring to mind
do they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other electronics producers, including Sony, Dell and
Lenovo,accept responsibility for their own products, supporting
'Individual ProducerResponsibility', and setting up free voluntary
take-back systems for theirproducts. Philips is lobbying against
the implementation of individual producerresponsibility, under
existing legislation and its adoption in futurelegislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare calling on Philips to accept responsibility for its own
e-waste and to takeback and recycle its products in every country
where they are sold. It shouldpay for the recycling of its own
products.When producers pay the real recycling costs, they have an
incentive tostop using toxic materials in the design of their
products and make them moredurable and recyclable in order to lower
the recycling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Tell Philips to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

	We've been watching the horizon for this one for a very long time, but our colleagues up in the crow's nest report that a new blip on the horizon could mean an end to Japanese whaling in Antarctica.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "I can see an end to whaling from here!"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major review of Japanese government spending could spell the end to whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioned to cut wasteful programmes by Japan's new government, a review committee has proposed massive cuts in subsidies to a body which funds the so-called whaling research programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without government subsidies, the whaling programme would be doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spending Review Committee recommended that the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Fund (OFCF), which gives loans to the Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR) to run the discredited science programme, have all of its funding revoked, except monies needed for loans in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFCF claims it needs 70.4 billion yen (around US$780 million) for various programmes, including whaling, in 2010. The Review Committee and Cabinet Office will determine by early next year if the proposed operations for 2010 are actually "necessary" or should also be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waste of money? Well, yes...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact is, if the Review Committee wanted to know if whaling was a waste of taxpayers' money or not, they could have asked us. Our colleagues at Greenpeace Japan have been relentlessly attacking the whaling programme domestically for exactly that reason for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, two activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, sparked a domestic debate in Japan in June 2008 when they revealed widespread corruption in the government-supported programme. They set off a backlash from powerful interests, and found themselves arrested for "stealing" whale meat which they had presented to police as evidence of embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru were arrested with the TV cameras rolling, and our Greenpeace offices were raided by police who seized supporter lists, documents, and computer disks in an attempt to intimidate our staff and supporters and deter our efforts.  Junichi and Toru still await trial and face up to ten years in prison for the "crime" of exposing a misuse of public money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the charges, they have not been quiet. Both activists have spoken out against the cost of the whaling programme and the fact that only a handful of fat-cat bureaucrats really profit from the programme. Last year alone it cost 8 billion yen, or nearly US$90  million, to run the annual Southern Ocean whale hunt. Of that, 1.2 billion yen, or more than US$10 million, came from government subsidies. The rest is in theory covered by the sales of whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling is bad business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Cetacean Research, which runs the whaling programme, has failed to repay government loans for several years now, as demand for whale meat has plummeted and the cost of whaling increased. Practises which would have lead to bankruptcy for any commercial firm have been the target of outspoken criticism not only from Greenpeace Japan, but from the business press and even the former spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Tomohiko Taniguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taniguchi lamented the financial propping up of a programme that caused endless headaches for Tokyo abroad and generated revenues worth "less than one-tenth the value of the country's annual market for toothbrushes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the change in government at the recent election, a new focus on reducing  spending and cutting wasteful programmes has meant a more sympathetic ear for whaling critics like Junichi and Toru. The Prime Minster recently shocked conservative politicians who equate whaling and patriotism by admitting that he disliked whale meat -- something that would have been an unthinkable admission for his predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24955/humpback-whale-and-calf-off-th.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="259"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thirty+ years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been fighting Japanese whaling for more than three decades, from the waters of the Southern Ocean to the online world to the courts of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first brought whaling to the world's attention in 1975 when activists put their own lives on the line by navigating small inflatable boats in front of the harpoons.   We have opposed whaling operations in countries including Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Iceland, Spain, Norway and Russia and exposed and shut down pirate whaling operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our tactics have widened to include consumer pressure -- which was crucial in getting western corporations such as Gortons Seafood to distance themselves from whaling,  financially isolating the whalers -- and domestic efforts in Japan aimed at communicating the cost of whaling to the 71 percent of the Japanese public that do not support it.  In 2008, we suspended our voyages to the Southern Oceans in favour of concentrating efforts on domestic pressure in Japan, including "Operation Silver Bullet" -- our ongoing investigation into whale meat embezzlement and scandals in the whaling industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it seems that strategy is paying off.  All of us who have worked together on this issue for decades are holding our breath -- that an end to Japanese whaling could well be on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/contact-the-prosecutor/"&gt;Ask the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's office to reopen the investigation into whale meat embezzlement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists Declare Nuclear Age Dead End</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activist-declare-nuclear-age-d/</url><text>
	Activists turned the front of the Turkish Ministry of Energy into a mortuary to highlight the deadly risks involved with establishing a nuclear industry in Turkey. On the eve of a nuclear tender from the Turkish government, 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group were arrested after they took to the street to protest the dangerous decision. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists were arrested after protesting the possible development of two new nuclear plants in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists unfurled a banner demanding a "STOP" to nuclear energy
and laid themselves on the line with a "die in" on the street in
front of the ministry. The protest ended when the 37 activists were
arrested, but they were later released without charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is currently nuclear-free and is considering nuclear
energy as a quick and cheap fix to its energy needs.  But nuclear
energy is anything but quick or cheap. In addition to being
extremely dangerous and dirty, nuclear energy will be a huge
financial burden on the people of Turkey. Greenpeace is urging the
government to cancel the nuclear tender and invest in clean, safe
renewable alternatives and greater energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not quick but very dirty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the hundreds of billions of US dollars that have been
given to the global nuclear industry in the past fifty years, we
still haven't seen a solution to the issues raised by waste and
security problems. A nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes
of nuclear waste annually. This means an additional 12,000 - 14,000
tonnes of waste are added to the already existing stockpiles of
nuclear waste every year. After recent radiation leaks in Spain and
incidents at plants in France, Sweden and Japan, you can't help but
wonder just how close we are to another Chernobyl. France leads as
an example of how dangerous nuclear energy can be, with
approximately 900 incidents a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear: an economic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with not being able to deal with all the risks, nuclear
power is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs and
construction time, companies do not want to invest. Neither the
World Bank nor the Asian Development Bank will give credits to the
nuclear projects on the grounds that they are too risky
financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means tax payers need to take the burden. The two nuclear
projects currently under construction in Turkey are about three
times over budget, and when the plants complete their lifetime,
decommissioning and cleaning will present yet another bill for the
taxpayer. It is unacceptable that the Turkish government wants to
spend its citizens hard-earned billions of liras on dirty,
dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for an Energy [R]evolution. Let's not fall
back on power from the past. We've come up with a plan to move from
a world powered by nuclear and fossil fuels to one running on
renewable energy. Download the blueprint for an Energy

	The Israeli police, supported by the navy, arrested the captain of the Rainbow Warrior - together with 14 Greenpeace activists, the photographer and the videographer - for passing on the message to “Quit Coal”. Activists had been painting the message, in English and Hebrew, on a ship importing coal to the Ashkelon power plant in Israel. Police boarded the Rainbow Warrior before we had even started the painting.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Israeli Marine forces boarded the Rainbow Warrior at the military restricted area near the Ashkelon coal plant before arresting 14 activists together with the captain who were simply asking Israel to "Quit Coal" and "Save the Climate".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Captain, Daniel Rizotti, was arrested by Israeli police. The
officers, arriving on a military ship and carrying machine guns,
came on board and demanded that he sail back to Ashdod, the port we
had left that morning. So, still waiting for the release of our
activists, we sailed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest marked the launch of our "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
Quit Coal: Save the Climate&lt;/a&gt;" tour through the Mediterranean and
Europe. Israel is only the beginning of our journey; we're visiting
11 countries en route to Poland, where crucial UN climate
negotiations continue this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why "Quit Coal"?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, when it comes to climate change, coal is by far the
worst offender.  Yet governments seem to be missing the message,
approving plans for hundreds of new coal-fired plants. If they
don't wake up to the urgent need to stop this, then by 2030 carbon
emissions coming from coal will have increased by some 60 percent.
We're here to sound the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our action in Israel was a wake-up call to the government to
abandon its plans for a new coal plant in Ashkelon. Despite
thousands of Israelis voicing their opposition to this unnecessary
and dirty plant, the government has approved plans anyway. But it's
not too late! &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-israel/news/coal_action_092008"&gt;Greenpeace
is urging all Israelis - whether at home or abroad - to lodge a
complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunny Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is very, very sunny. So it's pretty crazy that Israel is
not embracing this solar potential and instead continues to rely on
imported coal (not to mention the CO2 emissions of shipping the
coal to Israel from Colombia, Indonesia and Australia). Israel is
getting some things right - it has built the world's first solar
thermal plant, and it's selling that technology worldwide.
Something to celebrate indeed. But more is needed for Israel to be
guaranteed a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world must quit its addiction to coal; luckily we have the
cure. Greenpeace's &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/energyrevolution-250107/"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 50%, and deliver half the world's energy needs by
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, we now have our captain, activists, media team,
inflatables and cameras  back on board. We've been deported from
Israel, but now we're heading for Turkey - and the next stage of
our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
"Quit Coal" tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

	It's a victory for the Whitsunday Islands and the Great Barrier Reef, with a 20-year moratorium on all new shale oil projects in the region. Led by the Save Our Foreshore group, the success shows just how powerful local, grassroots campaigns can be.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef off the Whitsunday Islands. The proposed shale oil mine would have posed a range of threats to the region.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban has been welcomed by just about everyone but the
QueenlandResource Council, whose proposal was set to mine millions
of tonnes ofshale rock each year on a site just 10 km from the
gateway to the GreatBarrier Reef. The shale oil mine threatened to
drain precious watersupplies, and to risk toxic leaching and air
pollution from waste rock.Shale oil production is extremely
greenhouse gas intensive - emissionsfrom this project, combined
with the company's other plannedoperations, would have raised
Australia's current total emissions by30 percent within 20
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great win but it is madness that such a project could
haveeven been considered. We are facing catastrophic climate change
- wemust urgently cut emissions, not increase them. We don't need
toendanger the Great Barrier Reef or anywhere else by mining
fossilfuels. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/climate-change/solutions/clean-energy"&gt;
There are better energy sources&lt;/a&gt; that are ready to go right now.
If Queensland Premier Anna Bligh canblock this proposal for climate
reasons, we look forward to herblocking other major fossil fuel
projects in the state, includingexport coal expansions, for the
same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined &lt;a href="http://www.saveourforeshore.com/"&gt;Save Our Foreshore&lt;/a&gt; in

	In a long-awaited display of responsibility, the European Parliament’s Environment committee has voted through a strong package to reduce emissions from cars. As the committee went into session, it seemed certain that a compromise package riddled with loopholes would be the one to pass. However, the MEPs voted to stick with meaningful legislation, turning their backs on nine months of lobbying by the car industry.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists from Greenpeace Spain climbed the Osborne Bull, an internationally known symbol of Spanish roads, to "protect" him from increasing CO2 emissions from cars.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, average fleet emissions from new cars, which
are currently around 158 grams &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be reduced to 130 grams/km by 2012&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Must fall further to 95 grams by 2020&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For every gram over the average a manufacturer will face fines
of 95 euro per car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal still has to pass the full EU Parliament and the
Council of Ministers. But this is now increasingly likely to
happen, and we'll be defending this package every inch of the
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as a huge blow to the car industry lobby, which
has shamelessly defended its right to drive climate change by
putting profits ahead of the climate. The lobby, led by Volkswagen,
Mercedes and BMW will now have to embrace a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Four climbers from our ship the Rainbow Warrior were arrested yesterday, in Turkey,  after they occupied a giant coal loading platform to prevent a delivery of coal to the giant Sugozo coal-fired power station, one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world. After 11 hours blocking coal coming off the “Global Winner” (“Global Warmer” more like), a South African cargo ship, they were forced down by police using high-pressure water hoses. The four climbers and their support team have now been released and are facing the prospect of heavy fines for their actions.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists board one of the world's largest coal platforms at Botas Oil Terminal, stopping barges from importing coal to the Sugozu (Isken) coal fired power plant.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugozu coal power plant emits some 10 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide (CO2) a year (three times as much as Iceland), which
makes it the fourth largest single emitter of greenhouse gases in
the world, in terms of power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action was designed to send a message to the Turkish state
authority EMRA (Energy Market Regulatory Authority) - which is
responsible for licensing coal power plants. Launching Greenpeace
Turkey's  "Quit Coal" campaign, the action is just the beginning of
our work to stop the construction of 40 new coal fired power plants
currently planned in Turkey. Insanely, almost all of them will rely
on imported coal in a country where wind and solar alone could
easily exceed current electricity demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is already an international disgrace when it comes to
increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and has failed to even ratify
the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilal Atici, our Greenpeace Mediterranean Coal Campaigner says
"The Isken action is just the beginning - we will not stop until
our government wakes up and quits coal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Mediterranean Executive Director has requested a
meeting with EMRA this week to press our case. He will be outside
their head offices in Ankara ensuring that they listen to our very
simple demand "No new coal in Turkey - Embrace an energy
revolution." The ship is now en-route to Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is the second country on Greenpeace's European "Quit
Coal" ship tour - we are taking the message directly to governments
in the run-up to crucial UN climate negotiations in Poznan, Poland
this December. Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for post
2012 need to be set and the final agreement on these will be made
in Copenhagen in 2009. The period leading up to this is really
"make of break" for the climate. The message is pretty clear - in
order to have any meaningful deal to save the climate, the world
has to quit coal - the worst polluter of all fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

	Patience for world leaders talking about tackling climate change is wearing thin. Just as US President Barack Obama addressed a crowd of thousands in Prague on Sunday, Greenpeace activists unveiled a banner urging him to "lead the change on climate", a challenge Obama accepted in his speech. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/six-greenpeace-activists-unfur.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/six-greenpeace-activists-unfur.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six Greenpeace activists unfurled a huge banner with a message addressed to leaders of the EU-US Summit in Prague saying: "Bail out the climate!".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile far, far away from the EU-US Summit, an ice-bridge holding the Wilkins Ice Shelf (the size of Jamaica) to Antarctica collapsed due to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delivering an urgent message to world leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also unfurled a huge banner reading "Bail Out the Climate" from Prague's Nustle bridge, in full view of venue hosting the EU and US summit, which President Obama is also attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama said that the US is ready to lead on climate change. Now we need to see the European Union commit to working with him on that. This year's major UN climate change summit in Copenhagen is now only eight months away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all has been said and done &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/no-climate-bail-out-from-europ/"&gt; at recent summits&lt;/a&gt; of world leaders discussing climate action, much more has been said than really done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A transatlantic alliance we can be proud of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the US claiming to be committed to action on climate change there is an opportunity for the transatlantic alliance to take real action. Runaway climate change could make poverty permanent in the developing world, and strangle growth in the developed world, but the right decisions could head off the looming crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable impacts of climate change, developing countries need at least EUR 110 billion a year by 2020 from rich countries. This money should be raised through an international scheme that asks rich nations to pay for their carbon footprint, thus providing the certainty developing countries need to leverage private funds for green investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;40 percent GHG emission reductions by 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides financing green measures in developing countries, both the US and the EU will need to upgrade their reduction targets in the light of recent science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid runaway climate change, developed countries as a group need to commit to an aggregate target of at least 40 percent emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2020. (Read Greenpeace demands for Copenhagen: &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands/"&gt; Long version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; Short version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Leaders: Mark your diaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders have a chance to deliver both the financing and emission cuts through the UN climate process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we're calling on heads of state to tae personal responsibility for thenegotiations and sign up to attend the final climate summit in Copenhagen, at the end of the year: to ensure a good deal for the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meanwhile Antarctica melts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shattering of the bridge connecting the Wilkins Ice Shelf to Antartica comes in stark contrast to the glacial pace of the international climate negotiations taking place in Bonn where governments are trying to avoid acting responsibly, and bickering about who's at fault (hint: somebody else is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, since ice-shelves float, their collapse will not in itself contribute to sea level rise. Nonetheless, any resultant increase in the "flow" of inland glaciers due to the loss of the shelves, together with increased melt water runoff will add to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it in context, it's probable that the current reduction in ice-shelves in the region has no precedent in the last 10,000 years, and it is certain that this minimum has not been reached at any time in the last millennium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Boulders against bottom trawling  </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/boulders-against-bottom-trawli/</url><text>
	The fishing industry seems determined to catch every last fish in the North Sea.  The governments of the region and the EU have done little to stop them, but  they may soon hit a few snags: a team from Greenpeace Germany and Greenpeace Netherlands has sailed into the German North Sea and begun placing 150 granite rocks on the seabed.  They are hoping that the rocks, each weighing 2-3 tonnes and measuring one square cubic metre, will prevent fishing boats from bottom trawling on the Sylt Outer Reef.  This highly destructive fishing method involves a net being dragged across the seabed indiscriminately catching everything in its path.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bottom-trawling boats drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying fragile underwater ecosystems and decimating fish stocks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling not only decimates stocks of popular fish, such
as sole and plaice, but it also results in a large amount of
bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or
dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Netherlands and Greenpeace Germany are taking direct
action to protect the fragile rocky reef and sandbank habitats and
the many species that are dependent on them. The German Government
and fishing industry are unwilling to address the ongoing
destruction of vulnerable marine habitats and the imminent collapse
of North Sea fish stocks.  We hope that fishermen will now steer
clear of the Sylt Outer Reef and respect it as a marine
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25132/150-granite-rocks-are-being-pl.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, fish stocks are in free fall with around 90 percent of
predatory species, like tuna, having been wiped out since the
1950s. If we carry on with business as usual, very soon there will
be no fish left and no future for the industry. Only in June,
scientists warned that cod stocks in the North Sea are so depleted
that fishing must be halted altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, these warnings have been ignored. Rather than
establishing a marine reserve to allow the North Sea to recover,
European Ministers continue to bury their heads in the sand and
vote to increase catch quotas year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in areas recognised for their high ecological importance,
such as the Sylt Outer Reef, the destruction continues. Not only is
fishing allowed, but also industry extracts vast quantities of sand
and gravel, with devastating consequences for marine habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper these types of activity shouldn't be happening. The
Sylt Outer Reef is protected under European law - designated as a
'Special Area of Conservation' under the EU Habitats Directive. But
in reality this protection is worth little more than the paper it
is written on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are demanding that the German government push the European
Commission to put in place new measures to enforce a ban on fishing
in the area by the beginning of next year at the latest. We also
want the Dutch, Danish and UK governments to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want the German government to immediately put a stop to
the industrial extraction of sand and gravel in the area by
ensuring no new licences are issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, governments need to establish a global network of
fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of the world's
oceans, including the North Sea.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;In order to preserve our independence we don't accept money from governments or corporations.

	Twenty-four years after the attack by the French secret services against our ship the Rainbow Warrior - which cost the life of a Greenpeace photographer - the nuclear industry is once again at the heart a major spy scandal involving Greenpeace. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/more-nuclear-power-less-nucl.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/more-nuclear-power-less-nucl.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nuclear power makes some people really mad. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it is top staff at nuclear energy giant Electricité de France (EDF) that have been charged on suspicion of spying on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what spooked EDF? What worries them about our efforts to reveal the hidden face of the nuclear industry as being dangerous, expensive and unnecessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It all began... &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, ten activists set off in a tiny boat to prevent a nuclear blast planned by the United   States. This was Greenpeace's founding activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the world, we fight to expose the risks presented by nuclear energy and weapons, from radioactive waste transport to waste management to the risk of accidents.  We also highlight that &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/nuclear_fallacy/"&gt;nukes are no answer to climate change&lt;/a&gt;.  "Clean and safe" nuclear energy is a myth. People deserve and are entitled to a transparent and democratic debate on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story in France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, Greenpeace campaigns against EDF and French nuclear company Areva, particularly the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) a third generation reactor that is scheduled to be switched on in 2012 in Flamanville,  France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2009, following official confirmation that Nicolas Sarkozy would build a second EPR, we revealed evidence that waste from this type of reactor would be seven times more dangerous than the waste generated by its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in March of this year we made public the facts about the latest Mixed-Oxide (MOX) transport from France to Japan. The Areva shipment contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in the MOX - enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controversy started three years earlier, in May 2006, when we provoked the fury of the French government by publishing online a classified document showing the vulnerability of the Flamanville reactor should an airplane hit it in an accident or 9/11-style attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By publishing this document, Greenpeace played its role as a whistleblower," said Pascal Husting, executive director of Greenpeace France. "As such, the work of our activists should be protected by the state rather than be monitored or attacked by private companies!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent and non-violent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the French Government infiltrated Greenpeace in 1985, their objective was to derail our campaign against nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Their plan not only failed, it utterly backfired. The public response around the world was outrage, and in the end we won our campaign.  Despite being turned into a national pariah, Greenpeace France not only survived, it came back stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is built on two fundamental values: independence (both political &amp;amp; financial), and non-violence. We are not supported by any political party, do not endorse candidates and exist because of the generosity of individuals who choose to donate to us. This structural independence is how we guarantee the freedom of speech and action of the organisation, in all places and under all circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-violence is a fundamental element of all our activities. Based on these fundamental values, we mobilize public opinion and force decision-makers to address problems that threaten the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France as in the rest of the world, there's not a government or a corporation which can keep Greenpeace from being Greenpeace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate negotiators back out again in Bonn </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-negotiators-back-out-090409/</url><text>
	Another round of climate talks is over, this time in Bonn, Germany. Once again negotiators are leaving without a plan or having left any money on the table to tackle climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/hemnagar.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/hemnagar.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Heads of state need to commit to being present at negotiations to solve the climate crisis before it is too late.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats and negotiators have been wasting precious time for two weeks while the rest the world watches as ice caps melt, ice-sheets break off in Antarctica and Australia suffers from flash floods. What are they waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes we can&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there was a ray of hope on the horizon. The presence of the Obama administration at the climate negotiations and the fact that the US is once again engaged in the discussions seems to have lifted the mood. However, there has been little or no real progress made on the key issues and decisions we need on climate change. A change in mood just isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need our heads of state, world leaders, to take responsibility. We need all of the Presidents, Chancellors and Prime Ministers of the world to take personal responsibility and commit to making climate change important enough to show up to these meetings themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop letting weeks of negotiations go by without any progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need our leaders to take responsibility for this process, give their negotiators clear and strong direction over the course of this year, and show up to the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December, and make sure that we all get the climate deal that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A little less conversation, a little more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need real leadership and some hard numbers. The US has to come back with solid proposals in June, at the next round of negotiations, and the rest of the industrialised world has to knuckle down and close the gap between what they have agreed to and what the science says is necessary to to avert runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need targets for reducing greenhouse gases and money on the table for poorer countries to pay for climate impacts they're already experiencing and to take action to control their own growing emissions. This has a price tag - developing countries need at least EUR 110 billion a year (USD $140 billion). This money should be raised through an international scheme that asks rich nations to pay for their carbon footprint, providing the certainty developing countries need to leverage private funds for green investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides financing green measures in developing countries, both the US and the EU will need to upgrade their reduction targets in the light of recent science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid runaway climate change, developed countries as a group need to commit to 40 percent emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Tunmore, one our climate experts, who was at the Bonn meeting warned: "We are on the brink of runaway climate change.

<item><language>en</language><title>US Climate Bill - a start, but not yet enough</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/us-climate-bill-010409/</url><text>
	There’s still a long way to go, but the draft energy and climate bill unveiled yesterday in the US Congress gives some idea of what American climate policy may look like in the coming years. The bill provides for strong long-term targets, efficiency legislation, a cap-and-trade system, and sets the goal that 25 per cent of US electricity must come from renewable energy by 2025.Time to break out the champagne? Not quite...
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            US Climate Policy may not be hell and high water any more. But how good is it?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed efficiency standards are good and, as the experience of Japan and California shows, they work. By directing the EPA to establish regulation for refrigeration chemicals, cars, aviation and shipping, the bill could bring to many sectors the effective environmental governance they have previously lacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum portfolio standards for electricity markets are another proven success that can now be taken up nationally. One of the most successful examples is the standard in Texas, a state now at the heart of the US wind industry. A long-term target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 83 per cent by 2050 is nothing to be sniffed at either, and brings the US in line with the long-term ambitions of many progressive nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating a range of effective policy tools the bill will give the US government the power it needs to take strong action on global warming. The question is, will it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the short term targets aren't so good. When climate negotiators talk about cuts they mean cuts relative to 1990, the year specified in the Kyoto Treaty. Congressman Henry Waxman is talking about cuts relative to 2005, when emissions were much higher. If you convert the bill's domestic emissions cuts of 20 per cent by 2020 into '1990' emissions you get a cut of around 7 or 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These limited cuts are made even weaker by the provision in the bill for two billion tons of offsets. At first read, what this means in practice is that the US fossil fuel industry could continue to pump out CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, unabated, for the next 20 years, and buy its way out of saving the climate by buying cheaper, lower-quality emissions reductions from elsewhere, instead of taking responsibility for reducing its own pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound like progress to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real emissions reductions better than offsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest science is clear. The world needs to cut emissions far more quickly. To stop global warming, the world must end emissions from deforestation and industry. The developed world as a whole needs to achieve cuts of at least 40 per cent relative to 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years of environmental neglect under George Bush mean that US emissions have skyrocketed, but even an achievable overall  US commitment of 25 per cent - with at least 12 per cent domestic cuts in fossil fuel use - would help put the developed world on the path to climate victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill offers up to 10 billion dollars to fund Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).  This is just a way to extend a business-as-usual approach where the polluter gets paid rather than punished - and paid, no less, with money taken from the American taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate champions in Congress are working to enact a climate change plan by the end of this year, ahead of the climate negotiations taking place in Copenhagen. To do that, the bill must first secure the support of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, then the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the Senate needs to adopt its own version of the bill and pass it. Then the two bills will need to be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves plenty of scope for the bill to be changed, and here are the big changes that need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the targets and ensure that at least 12 per cent of the emissions cuts come through reductions in domestic fossil fuel use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop the funding for CCS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auction pollution permits, ensuring polluters pay and that revenues are used for climate and public benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these improvements are made, President Obama can arrive in Copenhagen with a real opportunity to forge the global deal that ends global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate meeting in Bonn: leaders wanted</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-meeting-bonn-290309/</url><text>
	When the future of the world is at stake, the last thing you need is a politician. You need a real leader.  And that's our challenge to governments attending the first round of international climate talks in Bonn.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/can-a-billion-mouseclicks-save.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/can-a-billion-mouseclicks-save.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Urgent: leaders wanted.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks are the first in a series of negotiations this year culminating at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December.  That meeting may well be viewed in decades to come as the most important gathering of world leaders of this century.  It's the place where a global deal to prevent runaway climate change will either be agreed, or we will all face the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game on: the planet is the prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race to forge a deal by the end of the year begins now. We need to see governments come off the starting blocks like cheetahs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We marked the opening of the Bonn climate talks with a demonstration outside the meeting featuring a giant balloon depicting a globe on fire.  It was surrounded by 60 people on bicycles and a banner reading "Urgent: climate leaders wanted." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key agenda items for Bonn is agreement on an overall mid-term emissions reduction target for the group of developed countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hu goes first? I don't know, you tell me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries especially need to end the ridiculous "after you'" charade that they have been engaged in for the last decade and simply agree to cut emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When US President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao meet for the first time at the G20 in the UK, the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters will have an opportunity to demonstrate their committment to leadership in a common cause -- or to continue the game of demanding the other commit first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint US/China commitment to finding climate solutions, including securing the necessary funding and a call to other world leaders to join them, could be the critical step that breaks the stalemate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all roads lead to Copenhagen. Every signal, every deal, every move on the table now will shape that crucial agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the world needs now is NOT love, sweet love.  It's action on climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we want out of the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen in December? Nothing short of a plan to save the planet: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global emissions to peak by 2015 and decline rapidly thereafter reaching as close to zero as possible by mid-century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed countries, as a group, to reduce emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels). At least three quarters of these reductions must be achieved domestically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries to reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The establishment of a funding mechanism to stop deforestation and associated emissions in all developing countries by 2020, with key areas (Amazon, Congo Basin and the Paradise Forests in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) achieving zero deforestation by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more detail about what we're demanding, and what we think the state of play is now, &lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/3/bonn-climate-talks-demands.pdf"&gt; have a look at our briefing document, "What's on the table in Bonn?" &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists in Italy chained themselves to a shipment of illegally logged azobé ‘blood timber’ in Italy’s Ravenna port, hanging banners reading “African Forest Crime” and “Forest Destruction = Climate Change.” We also took action outside the Colosseum at one Rome’s busiest Metro stations, hanging a giant banner with the message “Forest Destruction Sponsored by Me.Tro”  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/ravenna-port-italy-activists.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/ravenna-port-italy-activists.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ravenna port, Italy. Activists chain themselves to illegally logged 'blood timber' from Liberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cargo of 'blood timber' comes from Liberia, where it was illegally taken during the civil war. It is planned for use in upgrading Rome's metro system. Unsurprisingly, this had not been communicated to metro passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeace_italia/"&gt;So we exposed it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This truly is blood timber. During Liberia's decade's long civil war, the then president Charles Taylor exploited the country's tropical forests, handing them over in exchange for money and arms. As Chiara Campione from Greenpeace Italy said, "this blood timber has fuelled destruction, war and climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rome - a forest friendly city?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the azobé was bought by Italian company Interwood Srl, which recently won a €720,000 contract with Me.Tro Roma Spa, the company responsible for upgrading Rome's metro system. They plan to use it to maintain the train tracks, including replacing the sleepers, in Rome's A and B metro lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing illegally logged timber to be used for public transport works contradicts the Municipality of Rome's 2002 commitment to the Greenpeace campaign for "Forest Friendly Cities." As a signatory it promised to establish criteria to ensure companies carrying out public works could guarantee any timber they used came from legal and sustainable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asking companies to bid for the metro upgrade project, Me.Tro Roma did not include a single requirement that the timber used was guaranteed to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Italy must stop funding forest destruction, and start funding climate protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropical deforestation is responsible for 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Ending forest destruction is one of the fastest and easiest ways to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy is one of the biggest gateways in Europe for illegally logged timber. It is way past time the government stopped funding forest destruction and instead started doing something to save the climate by committing to fund forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've calculated that the EU and other rich nations that contribute the most to the climate crisis owe a carbon debt of at least €110 billion a year. By 2020, this money must be given to a fund to help developing countries, including Liberia, adapt to climate change and reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions by protecting their forests and developing clean energy. Italy's fair share of this carbon debt is at least €4 billion a year by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liberia must end blood timber trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also telling Liberian president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf that she must protect her country's precious forest resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The azobé shipment sent to Italy exposes fundamental holes in the management of the Liberian Forest Development Agency (FDA). The sustainable development institute briefing the &lt;a href="http://www.illegal-logging.info/uploads/TheHuntersWhistle.pdf"&gt; "Hunter's Whistle"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shows how the FDA authorised the shipment to Italy despite it contravening Liberian law on numerous occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liberian parliament is the in the process of considering three forest management contracts. We urge the Liberian government not to put the country's forests into the hands of logging companies - the result will devastate the country's development and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Deforestation is responsible for 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Support Greenpeace's campaign to cut emissions, not trees. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate meeting in Bonn: save the forests, but don't cheapen carbon</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonn-climate-meeting-forests300309/</url><text>
	If we're to have a hope of saving our planet from runaway climate change, we need to make it expensive for industry to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, and we need to make it profitable for countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to preserve their tropical rainforests.  Sounds angelically simple, but we need real leadership at the Bonn climate conference to get the devil out of the details. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/organgutans-are-an-endangered.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/organgutans-are-an-endangered.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Saving her shouldn't put money in the pocket of a polluter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around twenty percent of the world's greenhouse gasses come from deforestation. You read that right: twenty percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives to preserve our forests, and in particular the tropical rainforests which are vast carbon consumers, are essential to any deal to stop runaway climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How NOT to save the world's rainforests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forest protection is relatively cheap, and there's a risk that incentives for forest protection can be used to dilute the value of all carbon credits, giving big polluters an easier ride when they have to buy carbon credits on the open market.  The cheaper a ton of carbon pollution is to purchase, the less likely it is that a corporation or government will seek real reduction solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, not a few corporate lobbyists and heel-dragging governments have figured this out, and would love to see forest credits included in the carbon markets in a way that would make carbon cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just released &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/REDD-implications"&gt; a report&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-economics-of-redd-summary/"&gt; summary here&lt;/a&gt;) that demonstrates that including forest protection measures in carbon markets could crash the price of carbon by up to 75 percent and derail global efforts to tackle global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also lead to developing countries losing out on billions of dollars a year for investment in clean energy technologies. If these countries don't get incentives for a switch to low-carbon technologies, through carbon markets and funds, emissions will continue to rise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean energy investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report shows that countries like China, India and Brazil could lose tens of billions of dollars for clean energy investments if forest protection measures are included in an unrestricted carbon market.  Such a move would cause a "lock in" effect where dirty technologies, like coal fired power plants, would continue to be built and operated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also slash the number and value of energy credits, so countries like China and India would get less money for sustainable development policies -- an estimated $10 billion per year for China alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap forest credits sound attractive but a closer examination shows they are a dangerous option that won't save the forests or stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many options for forest financing currently on the table, this one ranks as the worst.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_full/international/photosvideos/photos/aerial-view-in-the-rainforest.jpg?plk" alt="Beltra: forests burning" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, how do we stimulate renewables AND save the forests?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a solution -- it's a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/solutions/forests_for_climate"&gt; separate fund for forest preservation. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the carbon markets should focus on driving clean and renewable technologies in key industrial sectors; and developed countries should make an additional "tropical deforestation commitment" to help finance forest protection in developing countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be done best through a new forest fund  -- one which values both the climate and biodiversity benefits provided by forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests contain half of all life on Earth. Orangutans, elephants, tigers and jaguars are just some of the animals who make their homes in tropical forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 150 million indigenous people live in forests worldwide. It's these people that need to have their futures secured so they can remain guardians of the forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If countries commit to a Forests for Climate fund, we can achieve win-win-win benefits for climate, biodiversity, and local communities and forest peoples.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line benefit for protecting our forests should not go to the planet's biggest polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	We've got a message for the leaders of the richest nations in the world who are gathering in London for the G20 meeting to discuss the global economic crisis.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace action in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen activists unfurled this 50 meter (164 feet) x 30 meter (98 feet) banner from the bridge at the Guanabara bay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to send this message from the birthplace of two of the most important UN Conventions of modern times, addressing climate change and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge wave of hope created by the World Summit ECO-92 (better known as the Earth Summit) in Rio -- that all countries would work together to save life on Earth -- has vanished. After 17 years without serious action by the world's leaders to change the pattern of carbon-based development, the planet is close to reaching the point where runaway climate change cannot be averted unless we act now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wasted opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will the G20 tackle the economic and climate crises at the same time by greening their economies? Unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy G20 nations need to commit at least 1 percent of their GDP to green measures, and the remaining countries should do all they can to leapfrog dirty carbon-based development and shift to a renewable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G20 leaders represent three-quarters of global GDP, three-quarters of energy consumption and three-quarters of carbon emissions. So far, they appear not to have grasped that their continuing prosperity is not in conflict with preserving the environment, but dependant upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crisis? You call THIS a crisis?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we don't face a choice of green jobs or dirty jobs, but green jobs or ecological and social collapse. Until climate change is at the top of the G20 communiqué and at the centre of their thinking, they aren't just scientifically illiterate, but economically illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science shows climate change is accelerating. A full-blown climate crisis raises the prospect of mass migration, mass starvation and mass extinctions. It will make poverty permanent in the developing world and strangle growth in the developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions the G20 leaders take will affect the 172 countries not represented at this meeting, many of which are both the poorest and most vulnerable to the economic crisis and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likely cost of climate change impacts is up to 20 percent of global output; more than the Great Depression and both World Wars combined - in addition to the human deaths and species extinctions, according to former World Bank chief economist &lt;a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Stern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Save forests to help stop climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries must also take responsibility to fight global warming, and in particular those which host tropical rainforests. Brazil and Indonesia are the world's fourth and third largest greenhouse gas emitters due to forest destruction in their countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Brazilian Institute of Space Research, which monitors deforestation, close to 29 million hectares of the Amazon rainforest have been destroyed since the creation of the UN Climate convention in Rio 92. This has added some 8 gigatons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending Amazon deforestation is the major contribution Brazil can make to help the world to tackle climate change. Still, Brazil must take the leadership by supporting the establishment of a funding mechanism to stop forest clearance and associated emissions, acknowledging the value of the standing forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bonn, Germany, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-meeting-bonn-290309/"&gt; 129 countries representatives are meeting&lt;/a&gt; to initiate a series of negotiations culminating with the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December, where a global deal to save the climate must be agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>What's inside your box of Kleenex?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kleenex-forest-destruction/</url><text>
	What’s it take to get the makers of Kleenex to protect forests as vigilantly as they protect profits? Kimberly-Clark, the parent company of Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, and Viva, will be holding its annual shareholder meeting in Dallas at the end of April 2009, and we plan to be there to push for forest protection. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/kleenex-wiping-away-canadian.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/kleenex-wiping-away-canadian.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kleenex - wiping away Canadian forests, one sheet of toilet paper at a time
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the run up to the meeting, we’ll be focusing a lot of attention on Kimberly-Clark's destructive business practices, starting with a video  entitled "What’s inside your box of Kleenex?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is that every box of Kleenex is filled with ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark doesn’t use recycled content in most of its consumer paper products, and the “What’s inside your box of Kleenex?”video shows just how much forest destruction Kimberly-Clark is packing into every box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue Guide provides consumers with alternatives to Kimberly-Clark’s forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We released the Greenpeace Recycled Tissue and Toilet Paper Guide in February to help consumers find alternatives to Kimberly-Clark’s forest-destroying products. The story was picked up by the &lt;a title="NYT: Mr. Whipple Left it Out" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/science/earth/26charmin.html?_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="The Guardian: American taste for soft toilet roll 'worse than driving Hummers'" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/26/toilet-roll-america" target="_blank"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and other media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark continues to wipe away ancient forests to make disposable products because the company does not have a comprehensive plan for protecting forests. The company itself has admitted that recycled fiber can provide “the product softness and quality consumers have come to expect from the Kleenex brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why doesn't Kimberly-Clark have a plan that ensures it's not buying any virgin fiber from the Boreal or any other endangered forests? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark’s annual shareholder meeting brings executives, boardmembers, and shareholders together to chart a course for the company over the next year. It is the most important meeting Kimberly-Clark holds, so we plan on sending a strong message about protecting forests. You can help get that message through, and let Kimberly-Clark know it's time they made forest protection as integral to their plans as profit protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://usactions.greenpeace.org/action/start/236/"&gt;Send a letter to Kimberly-Clark and let them know that you'll only use recycled products, like those found in our tissue guide, until they cleans up their act.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace can criticize companies like Kimberly-Clark because we don't take money from Kimberly-Clark. In fact, we take no money from any corporations or governments, to ensure that independence.  That means we rely on small donations from people like you. Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept cash from corporations or governments. This means we rely on individuals like you to continue working towards a safer climate for everyone. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In a “historic announcement” today delivered from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, “President Obama” has vowed to end the climate crisis by committing to legally binding, timely and deep emissions reductions that are ambitious, equitable and fair. “Obama” also committed to funding for mitigation and adaptation, and has pledged billions in funds to save forests.

            Faux-bama, Ilhan Anas, an Indonesian look-alike of United States President Barack Obama, holds a poster of the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short but momentous speech was the declaration that climate change activists around the world have been waiting for - except that it was delivered by 'Faux-bama' and not Obama: Ilham Anas, 34, is an Indonesian look-alike of the US President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His speech was delivered in a creative action organized by &lt;a title="southeast" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/obama-vows-to-end-climate-cr" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the global &lt;a title="tcktcktck" href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; activities to call on world leaders to act on climate change, ahead of the climate session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this September 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real President Obama will make an address at the UNGA, while the 'Faux-bama' address was aimed at securing his attendance at the UN Climate Summit in December which is not yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Obama for Copenhagen!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama and other world leaders have an opportunity to show climate leadership at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December. It is the best chance we have to avoid runaway climate change and the devastating consequences - world leaders must agree to a just and binding deal that will create significant reductions in world emissions and halt deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few challenges facing the world are more urgent than combating climate change. Many of you are working to confront this challenge. I am committed to working on this with you.I will attend the Copenhagen Climate Summit.I will ensure an ambitious, fair and binding global climate treaty.I will make funds available for climate mitigation and adaptation, starting with funds to protect the remaining forests.This is our chance to build a new future for our children. I will not let this moment pass us &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>HP, Lenovo and Dell still on the toxic stuff</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hp-lenovo-and-dell-get-a-310309/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Top PC makers are slipping behind in Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We're giving HP, Lenovo and Dell a penalty point in our updated Guide to Greener Electronics, for breaking their promises to phase-out toxic chemicals in 2009. Of the world's five top PC makers, only Apple is truly kicking the habit. Meanwhile Philips has jumped from 15th to 4th place in the list of electronics companies who are cleaning up their act.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists demonstrate against e-waste outside the Hewlett Packard (HP) Beijing headquarters. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP, Lenovo and Dell had promised to eliminate vinyl plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from their products by the end of 2009. Now they've told us that they won't make it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase-out of toxic substances is an urgent priority to help tackle the growing tide of e-waste. Still, producers only go green when they feel public and consumer pressure to do so. That's why we campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell produces a desktop, a notebook and several models of monitors that have a reduced use of PVC and BFRs, and a few monitor models that are free of these substances. Lenovo has two models available that are PVC and BFR-free. HP is trailing behind, and has yet to bring out models with even a reduced use of PVC and BFRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While HP and Dell have yet to set a new timeline for completely eliminating these substances from all their products, Lenovo has delayed its deadline to the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-step detox for companies: Come clean, go green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, now in its 11th update, shows which electronics companies are investing to meet their commitments to remove toxic substances from their products, tackle climate change, and introduce better recycling and take-back policies. When electronics companies pay for the collection (take-back) and recycling of their own products, they have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple can do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple doesn't have certified PVC-free power cords yet, but in every other way its products are now PVC and BFR free. If Apple can do it, then so should the other leading PC manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe all electronics companies should have at least one toxic-free line of products on the market by the end of the year. Acer currently remains committed to phasing out PVC and BFRs in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philips springing forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guide to Greener Electronics star this time goes to Philips -- and the 47,000 people who sent emails to the company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch electronics giant reacted to our e-waste campaign with a dramatic about-turn on recycling and take-back. It's jumped from 15th to 4th place in one go. Following public pressure, the company has significantly improved its position on taking financial responsibility for the recycling of its products when they become e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips still needs to implement a system to make it work, but &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/"&gt; we're delighted with the direction it's heading in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individual producer responsibility is the gift that keeps giving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present and how easy products are to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "pay for the mess you make" approach is called "Individual producer responsibility", and it's crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Change on the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an overall slump in scores in the toxics categories, companies are starting to improve their scores on energy criteria. IT is a key sector in the fight against climate change and could enable emissions reductions of 15 percent of business-as-usual by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung joins Philips in publically demonstrating support for global steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to tackle climate change. Dell and Nokia join HP and Philips in making commitments to substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies are now increasing their use of renewable energy, with Nokia already sourcing a quarter of its electricity use from renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate challenge to IT execs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing electronics companies to public pressure is helping to green the industry. They could do much more, not only to clean up their own act, but to help the planet avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climateleaders"&gt;the IT Climate Leadership Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The aim this year is simply to get influential IT execs to lobby key governments for a strong, planet-saving agreement at the December 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we can't see anybody in the IT industry using their access to politicians -- and their influence as major employers and wealth creators -- to lobby for a strong Copenhagen deal. Meanwhile dirty industries are lobbying like there's no tomorrow. So we'll soon launch an international "who's who" and "who's doing what" of top IT execs we want to see leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, we accept no money from governments or corporations. Greenpeace runs on the donations of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>New: Google Earth tour of rainforest victory for climate</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/google-earth-soy-300909/</url><text>
	In collaboration with the Danish government and others, Google is launching a series of Google Earth layers and tours to allow you to explore the potential impacts of climate change on our planet and possible solutions.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Soya field. It is illegal in Brazil to destroy Brazil nut trees so they are left standing when the forest is cleared.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week a set of tours, narrated by Al Gore, gave an idea of what the world might look like in 2050 if we do nothing to stop global warming. This week, Google launches another set of climate change tours, including one by Greenpeace telling a success story about what can happen when we take action for solutions today: the moratorium on new soya plantations in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the soya moratorium in Brazil is a tale of one small but significant step toward saving the Amazon and, with it, our planet's climate.  Tropical deforestation accounts for up to a fifth of greenhouse gasemissions, more than all the world's airplanes, trains and cars. It hasled Brazil to become the world's fourth worst climate polluter andmeans that runaway climate change cannot be averted unlessdeforestation is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we took action in 2006 to try and stop one of the biggest drivers of Amazon deforestation in Brazil: the clearing of rainforest to make way for more and more soya plantations to feed Europe's growing hunger for fast food.  It's a tale that involves Greenpeace researchers, unlikely corporate bedfellows, action under the canopy and beneath the golden arches of McDonalds, and you, our supporters, who helped build consumer pressure that could not be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://mw1.google.com/mw-weather/outreach/cop15tours/soya/soya.kmz"&gt; watch the tour in Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; if you have it, or here on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;YouTurn the (Google) Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to &lt;a href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/google-earth-tar-sands.kmz"&gt; view the Canadian tar sands&lt;/a&gt; as an angel would see them -- an oily, blackened, treeless scar upon the planet's face -- or take an eagle-eye view of the magnificent forests they are destroying, Google Earth is a great tool for bearing witness both to our planet's natural majesty and the marks humanity has made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we launched a Global Awareness layer in partnership with Google which bundles  images, video, and information about saving our planet's forests, stopping climate change, and protecting our oceans into every copy of Google Earth.  (What's that? You're a Google Earthling and you've never seen it? Turn on your sidebar with Ctrl-Alt-B, then click on Layers &amp;gt; Global Awareness &amp;gt; Greenpeace)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has also launched a &lt;a title="google cop15 channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/cop15" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; called "Raise your Voice" dedicated to the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December, where you can join celebrities and activists in sending your own video message to the world leaders that will gather there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos will be broadcast on screens aroundthe conference in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how many world leaders will be there to see those messages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have even committed to go to the summit.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a moment to turn the Earth in the right direction?  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit/call-for-copenhagen"&gt; Give those leaders a phone call to demand they attend the climate summit&lt;/a&gt; and take personal responsibility for ensuring a fair, ambitious,  binding deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit/call-for-copenhagen"&gt;Call a world leader or sign our petition demanding that they personally attend the Copenhagen Climate Summit and sign a fair, ambitious, binding deal to stop global warming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A "new epoch of sea-ice melt"</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/new-epoch-sea-ice-180909/</url><text>
	The minimum area of summer Arctic sea-ice extent was reported this week to have plummeted to the third-lowest level in recorded history. This is Earth's way of saying that we're reaching the limits of what the planet can sustain. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar Bears on an ice shelf. Mother and cub.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic sea-ice reached its yearly minimum low on September 12th, according to the US &lt;a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2009/091709.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest ever extent was recorded in 2007, and the second lowest in 2008. While these are signs that the greenhouse effect is real and requires urgent action, some people are still in denial - see the message on the NSIDC's twitter feed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/sea-ice-extent/" target="_blank"&gt;minimum sea-ice extents &lt;/a&gt;are more than records -- they are a call for attention to world leaders about the devastation that is happening all over the world due to climate change. We really need to reduce carbon emissions immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earth is losing its "climate control"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens in the great North goes way beyond the polar circle. When the sea-ice melts, it triggers several feedback loops. The first is greater heat absorption -- without the white sea-ice to reflect the sun, more heat is asorbed in the ocean, making it warm faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4x49ZW"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/9/twitter-quote.png" alt="Twitter" width="420" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second feedback loop is the disappearance of old, thicker sea-ice. The ice that melted this year will be replaced during the winter by new ice, less thick, which melts more easily the next summer. Simply put, the more ice melts, the less control we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New epoch of sea ice melt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/about/ships/the-arctic-sunrise/" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/a&gt; is currently in the Fram Strait, in the Arctic region, and approaching the ice edge. On board is world-class sea-ice expert Dr. Peter Wadhams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're entering a new epoch of sea-ice melt in the Arctic Ocean due to climate change," said Dr. Peter Wadhams. "In five years' time most of the sea-ice could be gone in summer, with just an 'Alamo of ice' remaining north of Ellesmere Island. In 20 years' time, that will also be gone, leaving the Arctic Ocean completely ice-free in summer. It's clear we can't rely on current models of prediction for sea-ice melt, as they have been constantly outpaced since the 1980s."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: Act now!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the time for action is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, not just in five years, when it will be too late to keep feedback effects under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's needed is a 40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 on the part of developed countries. They also need to invest US$ 140 billion per year to help developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change, stop deforestation and switch to a low carbon economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do anything less is to ignore the warnings we're seeing in the Arctic and elsewhere that tell us that the climate is in serious peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we want world leaders to show their commitment to stop the devastating effects of climate change now,and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0" target="_blank"&gt;attend the Copenhagen climate conference at the end ofthe year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Patience for global leaders is wearing thin as Arctic sea ice. Ask them to get a move on and go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work. Consider making a donation to help us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Illegal genetically modified organisms found in Germany</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/illegal-genetically-modified-o/</url><text>
	Residents of Germany, (and the rest of you Europeans) watch your breakfast! We've just learned there's a secret genetically-engineered ingredient in some of your food that shouldn't be there. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/linseed.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/linseed.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Linseed.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal genetically-engineered linseed (also known as flaxseed) from Canadian fields has been found in some of Germany's baked goods and cereal, according to the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linseed, which was never commercially grown in Canada, contains an antibiotic-resistant and herbicide-tolerant gene and has not been approved in the European Union. Though linseed is not a staple food, it is a widely-used health-food and can be found in baked goods, cereal and oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a test conducted by the German federal state Baden-Württemberg, 39 percent of the samples were found to be contaminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Germany today &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.de/themen/gentechnik/nachrichten/artikel/greenpeace_weist_nach_illegaler_gen_leinsamen_in_broetchen_und_muesli-1/"&gt;released the results of their research&lt;/a&gt; finding genetic contamination in products such as bread, cereals, baking mixes and in whole and crushed linseed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without knowing it, the German population has become guinea pigs," stated Alexander Hissting, one of our experts on Genetic Engineering (GE). This proves, yet again, that once released into nature, genetically engineered constructs are uncontrollable and cannot be recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German  Federal State has already announced that the linseed contamination is a European problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to recognise that the only effective protection from the uncontrolled spread of genetically modified organisms is a worldwide ban on their cultivation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Germans should be made aware of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.de/fileadmin/gpd/user_upload/themen/gentechnik/UEbersicht_Analyseergebnisse_Leinsaaten_10.9.2009_final.pdf"&gt;which brands have been affected by the infected linseed&lt;/a&gt;, and those products should be taken off the shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand against genetically modified organisms. There is insufficient scientific research on their effects on the environment and human health. Genetic engineering is a threat to biodiversity as GE plants can spread and infect natural strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linseed is a widely-used health-food and can be found in baked goods, cereal and oil.  68 percent of Canadian-grown linseed is exported to Europe, and a proposed ban on the import of the seed would be devastating to Canadian farmers.  This strain is illegal for commercial growth in Canada, which has led to questions as to how the contamination could have occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the latest example of this type of contamination: in 2006, unapproved GE rice spread all over the world, and earlier this summer, shipments of American soybeans containing traces of GE corn were blocked before entering Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose
risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;Ask governments worldwide to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting GE Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments.

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

            Elephants take Thai Buddhist monks to bless the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

rapid action to save the planet from the devastation effects of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 15-day journey, a people's caravan for change, will traverse
the vast Central Plains of Thailand, from Khao Yai National Park to
the outskirts of Bangkok. The city is the venue of a crucial UNFCCC
(United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change) meeting
ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands. Ask them to go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work.

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;

            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

	The world’s largest food fishery is on the verge of collapse. Pollock, used to make McDonald’s fish sandwiches, frozen fish sticks, fish and chips, and imitation crabmeat, have had a population decrease of 50 percent since last year.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our appetite for fish is exceeding the oceans' ecological limits with devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. Scientists are warning that overfishing results in profound changes in our oceans, perhaps changing them forever.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling fish populations are largely due to the enormous
amounts of fish being removed from Alaska's Bering Sea. Factory
trawlers take over a million tonnes of pollock out of the ocean
each year. The fish can't reproduce and recover as quickly as they
are being fished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the financial institutions on Wall Street collapsed due
to poor oversight and mismanagement-the pollock fishery is on the
fast-track to collapse as well. In order to avoid a collapse, the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council must take swift and
decisive action when they meet in December to reduce catch levels
and put pollock back on the path to healthier population
levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Billion Dollar Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pollock fishery is a billion-dollar industry. These days, it
seems when you have that much money at stake, common sense gets
thrown out the window. Each year, fishery management wants to catch
the most fish to get to the most profit. They continue to fish,
even when warning bells are going off and science tells them its
time to cut back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how much pollock are they catching? Picture this- if the
pollock from the 2004 catch were laid end to end they would wrap
around the earth more than 38 times. Now, that's a lot of fish
sticks! Pollock are being fished excessively and cannot keep up
with the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four Alaska pollock stocks, two are now shut down
completely and a third is just a fraction of its former size.
Despite the warning signs, including five years in a row of low
juvenile survivorship, the industry has continued to target the
pollock spawning aggregation, taking huge numbers of pregnant
females before they release their eggs. This kind of fishing
practice only deepens the problem by not allowing pollock to
reproduce, grow and mature to reproduce again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bering Sea Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and conservationists have warned that unless the
Council reduces fishing pressure on Pollock - a vital forage
species for fur seals, whales, and endangered Steller sea lions -
the entire Bering Sea ecosystem could be in jeopardy of collapse.
This would prove devastating for the state's commercial fishermen
and traditional coastal communities that depend on a healthy ocean
for their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swift Action is Needed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing interests have no doubt played a huge role in shaping
the pollock fishery. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council
is dominated by fishing industry representatives. With exemptions
from conflict of interest laws, Council members regularly vote
against measures that would affect their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council will
set thenew pollock catch limits for 2009. In order to restore the
pollockfishery's health, the allowable catch must be cut in half,
fishing onspawning populations suspended, and marine reserves
established toprotect critical habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Exposed! Big oil's dirty tricks </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-oil-tricks190809/</url><text>
	Following our exposure of a secret oil industry plan to fake public concern over US climate legislation - we're putting big oil companies in the spotlight to make sure nobody falls for their dirty tricks. The leaked memo from the American Petroleum Institute (API) revealed its request for members to have employees masquerade as concerned 'Energy Citizens' at rallies held across the US this month.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/8/aug-18-2009-greenpeace-act.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/8/aug-18-2009-greenpeace-act.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cut the crap! Climate change is the most pressing environmental crisis of our time.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attempt to deceive politicians and the public by forging a grassroots campaign (known as "astroturfing") was highlighted by &lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/blog/greenpeaceusa_blog/2009/08/18/greenpeace_action_calls_out_climate_frau"&gt; our activists who laid real Astroturf outside the API headquaters in Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; They also held a sign reading "Climate fraud funded by big oil" and branded the Astroturf with the logos of oil giants ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game plan known&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/oil-memo/"&gt; The API memo, leaked to Greenpeace last week&lt;/a&gt;, called on the CEOs of some of the world's biggest oil companies to "indicate to your company leadership - your strong support for employee participation in the rallies." The API's President, Jack Gerard, further warns the world's oil barons to treat the memo as "sensitive," arguing that "we don't want our critics to know our game plan".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memo and the rallies are in direct contradiction to many of its members' stated support for "cap and trade" climate legislation in the US. Not only that, but the API was citing misleading economic statistics to back its campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Come clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scam makes a mockery of the public debate on climate action. Energy companies could be putting their workers to work on an energy revolution, rather than busing them out of their workplaces to attend bogus rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, over US$ 82 million has been spent on corporate lobbying including against climate change legislation, by the oil and gas industry alone. The CEOs and Presidents of API member companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, General Electric and others must publicly denounce these dirty tricks. They must make clear to Governments their support for strong climate action at the upcoming UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government climate and energy policy must be based on climate science and the genuine expression of public opinion - not vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN Climate Summit is rapidly approaching - in addition to calling on big oil to stop the lies - we're also asking for all Heads of State to show up to the meeting in Copenhagen this December - and take personal responsibility for a good climate deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We're only as strong as the people who support us. By giving what you can to support our activists, researchers, campaigners, political advisors and lawyers - you can help us stand up against the oil industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Philips back in the red again</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philips-back-in-the-red161008/</url><text>
	Philips Electronics has long been in the red with a big fat zero on tackling e-waste in our Guide to Greener Electronics. Meanwhile, in Moscow’s Red Square, it is celebrating 110 years in Russia with its annual 'Sense and Simplicity' event. We did a spot of corporate gatecrashing to remind Philips that, after all these years, doing the right thing is still simple: take back and recycle. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Philips stands out as the company with the worst position on e-waste and recycling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips stands out as thebiggest obstacle to tackling the
growing problem of old electronics (e-waste)being dumped in
developing countries. Not that you'll find any reference tosuch
details in Philips' marketing material. That's why we paid a visit
tohighlight the real consequences of Philips' position. In fact, we
discoveredthat never mind simply not mentioning the real truth,
Philips' public materialwas overflowing with elaborate wording
gushing over how responsible, healthyand sustainable Philips
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Circle of irresponsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a copyof Philips' greenwashed press packet in a trash
bin. It claims Philips' eventis all about a healthy lifestyle and
maintaining a sustainableenvironment. It talks about
responsibleconsumption and a shopping experience it calls the
"Circle of Life." Philipsclaims the concepts and products presented
at the event are about itscommitment to "health and well-being of
people across the globe" and to"collective well-being, and helping
to create a sustainable global society toprotect our environment
for future generations."&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If this is the case, then why does
Philipsfail to take back and recycling it products globally in
contrast to manycompetitors like Dell and Nokia? Why does it refuse
to accept the real costs oftheir own e-waste? Instead, Philips
promotes and actively lobbies forgovernments and public to
subsidise recycling its e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unhealthy People, Unhealthy Living, Unhealthy Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips should takeresponsibility for its own products. If it is
really interested in a"sustainable global society", it should make
sure all of its products are collectedand not leave the burden of
cleaning up toxic e-waste on unprotected workers.E-waste can end up
in countries without recycling facilities and the recyclingworkers
treating the waste - often children - are exposed to a cocktail
oftoxic chemicals and poisons when the products are broken
apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unprotected workers in thee-waste dumps of China, India,
Pakistan and Ghana who end up dismantlingPhilips products are a
world away from Philips' 'Sense and Sensibility'marketing, but that
doesn't change the fact that Philips is the company whoseposition
is blocking real solutions to the problem. Watch the snap shot
ofpersonal stories of e-waste workers in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words healthy and sustainable certainly don't spring to mind
do they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other electronics producers, including Sony, Dell and
Lenovo,accept responsibility for their own products, supporting
'Individual ProducerResponsibility', and setting up free voluntary
take-back systems for theirproducts. Philips is lobbying against
the implementation of individual producerresponsibility, under
existing legislation and its adoption in futurelegislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare calling on Philips to accept responsibility for its own
e-waste and to takeback and recycle its products in every country
where they are sold. It shouldpay for the recycling of its own
products.When producers pay the real recycling costs, they have an
incentive tostop using toxic materials in the design of their
products and make them moredurable and recyclable in order to lower
the recycling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Tell Philips to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

	Greenpeace today embarked on the Indonesian leg of its "Forests for Climate" ship tour, to shine the spotlight on the rampant destruction of the Paradise Forests - the last remaining ancient forests of Southeast Asia.

            A group of Papuanese traditional dancers greets the Esperanza during a welcoming ceremony at Jayapura port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; arrived in Jayapura, in the Indonesian
province of Papua, to an energetic welcome from a troupe of
traditional dancers, and local dignitaries - including the mayor of
Jayapura - gave their support to our campaign."Forests for Climate"
is not only the slogan for our Paradise Forests tour - it's also
the name of a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forests_for_climate_brochure/" target="_blank"&gt;landmark proposal&lt;/a&gt; Greenpeace has developed,
for an international funding mechanism toprotect tropical
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just completed a six-week tour of neighbouring Papua New
Guinea, the &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; will tour Indonesia starting with the
provinces of Papua and West Papua, which represent the last
frontier of intact ancient forests in the country. Over the next
six weeks, the ship will be touring the archipelago to document the
threats facing the forests of Papua and Sumatra as well as the
companies and politicians responsible. Also, we will be
highlighting the short and long-term solutions to the crisis so
these forests can be permanently protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one half of the remote and mountainous New Guinea island,
Papua contains the largest area of remaining forest in Indonesia -
with those of Sumatra and Kalimantan on the island of Borneo
largely gone or degraded, this really is the last frontier. The
region is home to hundreds of distinct tribes and clans with a
corresponding range of cultural diversity, and for biodiversity is
second to none, with animals and plants new to science being
recorded on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That alone makes the forests worth protecting, but we now
realise they're also vitally important when it comes to climate
change. Not only do the trees and soil act as huge carbon stores,
cutting them down also releases that carbon in the form of
greenhouse gases. Indonesia is the third largest emitter on the
planet, largely due to deforestation and its forests are
disappearing faster than anywhere in the world, so to prevent
climate change we have to save the forests, including those in
Papua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to do this is to place a moratorium on all deforestation
across Indonesia, which will provide the breathing space necessary
to work on plans to safeguard the future of these forests. The
Indonesian government is the one to lay down a moratorium, but it
also needs the palm oil industry to provide ministers the space to
do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/" target="_blank"&gt;the victory with our Dove campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier
this year, we have been working with companies such as Unilever to
build a coalition in favour of an immediate moratorium on forest
conversion for palm oil and insisting their palm oil suppliers do
not clear further forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of climate change are already being felt around the
world and we don't have long to prevent the worst predictions
becoming inevitable. We still have time if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

	Illegal logging is rapidly destroying the Earth's stores of natural resources at a time when runaway climate change threatens life on every continent. However, a review of the legality of 156 logging contracts in Democratic Republic of Congo will put its ancient forests in peril, rather than protect them.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A woman from a forest dependant community gathers firewood. Approximately 40 million people in the DRC depend on the rainforest for their basic needs, such as medicine, food or shelter. Logging is seen by the World Bank and other donors as a way to alleviate poverty and promote economic development.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging titles have been under the microscope in DRC for three
years, under a review financed by the World Bank. Greenpeace has
been keeping watch to see if the review actually protects these
ever-diminishing tropical forests, rather than the loggers'
short-term profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday 6 October, the review was announced and at the same
time Environment Minister Jose Endundo made a public commitment to
extend the current moratorium. While the announcement of the
moratorium is good news, we fear that with such a flawed review,
the reality could be business-as-usual for unregulated logging in
the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legal precedents ignored&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, a moratorium stopped the allocation of new concessions
in DR Congo, in an effort to keep logging out of protected areas.
The Government then launched a review in 2005 to determine which
existing contracts could be converted to legal concessions under
the conditions of the Forest Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial findings released this week, the commission
responsible for the review has declared that logging can now take
place under 46 of the 156 contracts - including 33 that are illegal
titles obtained in breach of the 2002 moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very start, the terms of reference were flawed and
easily manipulated by companies with vested interests. For example,
the review's own Technical Working Group said that there was not
enough information on previous permit boundaries to judge whether
companies have been operating outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/DRC-logging-sector-briefing" target="_blank"&gt;briefing paper&lt;/a&gt; published today shows how more
destructive logging could occur on these concessions that were
obtained illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No social or environmental considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the terms were followed properly, the review would still
be woefully inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social conflicts are ever-present in these company's concession
areas - violations of human rights are the rule rather than the
exception. However, the review did not measure or even acknowledge
this aspect of logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without social and environmental criteria, the process ignores
both local people's livelihoods and the global significance of
tropical forest in stabilising climate change and protecting
biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft review findings were kept secret for over a week, only
circulated to the companies concerned and not to forest communities
who are immediately at risk from logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desperate need for good governance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss-German SIFORCO (owned by Danzer Group) and all the
subsidiaries of the Portuguese NST Group have seen the majority of
their titles approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/conning-the-congo/" target="_blank"&gt;Conning the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, we exposed how companies
like Danzer are cheating local people out of large amount of tax
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies are now promoting themselves as ready for
"sustainable certification" for European markets. In fact, they are
logging in intact forests, near biodiversity hotspots and exporting
masses of internationally protected tree species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we really expect them to do the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without basic regulation, it is impossible enforce the law or
trace the origin of logs - making a mockery of international
efforts to cut demand for illegal forest timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Environmental Minister has committed to extend the
current moratorium we urge the DRC government to turn this
commitment into a reality with a legally binding Presidential
decree. We also urge those nations who are active donors of the DRC
to provide support so that this decree can be properly implemented
and monitored while the country works to improve the governance in
the forest sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also time for alternatives given the scientific evidence
of the vital role forests play in stablising global climate change.
To protect the remaining Congo forests, we call for a participatory
land-use plan, based on the needs and rights of forest-dependent
communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our oceans are being plundered by pirates. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing – also known as "pirate fishing" - has become a global scourge. From international waters around the world, to the islands of the South Pacific and the coastal communities of West Africa, fisheries are in crisis.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/piratefishing2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/piratefishing2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Pirate fishing can be stopped. Governments can outlaw flags of convenience and refuse entry to fishing and supply vessels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirates are pulling in billions of dollars of fish that
rightfully belongs to coastal communities or falls beyond any one
country's waters. Pirate fishing affects communities that cannot
afford to be robbed of their livelihoods, leaves the marine
environment bruised and battered, and undermines food security and
attempts at sustainable management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roll call&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official lists of pirate vessels are limited in the information
they contain and don't include the names of the big companies
behind these pirate fishing vessels. It's time for the truth: for
fish purchasers, retailers, and the public to see who's behind
pirate fishing, and for ship owners to start taking responsibility
in their role. Companies often have illegal and legal vessels
fishing side by side. It is time they pay the real price for piracy
and have all their operations held accountable when caught
pirate-fishing.  We've launched an online database of fishing
vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, and the companies who own them.   &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/" title="Pirate Blacklist"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our IUU blacklist is the first independent record of fishing
vessels, support vessels and companies involved in pirate fishing. 
It includes independent observations from the legal fishing
industry, government authorities, and first-hand evidence from
Greenpeace and other NGOs who have recorded the activities of these
vessels and companies at sea and in ports around the world.  The
new database supplements the existing IUU database that was
launched in 2007, which contained only those pirate fishing vessels
officially blacklisted by regional fisheries management
organisations and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging all retailers and seafood traders to ensure
they do not purchase pirate-caught fish and, as a first step,
ensure that they do not trade with companies listed as operators of
pirate vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

	At 2am this morning, four Greenpeace activists boarded the Windsor Adventure, a coal cargo ship importing coal from Colombia into Spain. Activist painted “Quit Coal” on the side of the ship as it entered Gijon, one of the biggest coal harbours in Spain. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/greenpeace-activists-paint-the-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint the slogan 'Quit Coal' in English and Spanish onto the side of the Windsor Adventure, a coal cargo ship from Colombia to Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government relies heavily on coal, the most
polluting of all fossil fuels, for the country's energy supply. 
The activists took action to call on to the government to quit coal
and switch to subsidising clean, renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Free Pass for Coal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government imports 24 million tonnes of coal and
pays €2,500 million in state aid to the coal industry every year,
more than the renewable energy industry receives. A third of the
world's CO2 emissions come from coal, yet the Spanish government,
like all EU countries, has granted the coal industry CO2 emissions
rights for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action comes one day before the European Parliament votes on
the EU's response to climate change. Greenpeace is calling on the
EU to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by
2020, and to vote for measures to block construction of over 50 new
coal-fired plants in Europe. The Spanish government talks about
tackling climate change while feeding subsidies right into the
industry that are causing it. The potential of renewable energy in
Spain is enormous and with the right investment, they can supply
all the electricity and even all the energy needed with
renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This autumn, the Greenpeace ships Rainbow Warrior and Arctic
Sunrise, are bringing the "Quit Coal" message to the Mediterranean
and Europe. The tour, from Israel to Poland, is taking place in the
run-up to UN climate negotiations in Poznan, Poland this December.
Quitting coal will be essential to a meaningful deal to save the
climate. European governments must show leadership by phasing-out
coal in their own countries.   &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" title="quit coal!"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about the Quit Coal tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's Energy [R]evolution shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 5o percent, and deliver half the world's energy needs
by 2050. Download the blueprint for an Energy [R]evolution:&lt;/p&gt;

	In a long-awaited display of responsibility, the European Parliament’s Environment committee has voted through a strong package to reduce emissions from cars. As the committee went into session, it seemed certain that a compromise package riddled with loopholes would be the one to pass. However, the MEPs voted to stick with meaningful legislation, turning their backs on nine months of lobbying by the car industry.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists from Greenpeace Spain climbed the Osborne Bull, an internationally known symbol of Spanish roads, to "protect" him from increasing CO2 emissions from cars.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, average fleet emissions from new cars, which
are currently around 158 grams &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be reduced to 130 grams/km by 2012&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Must fall further to 95 grams by 2020&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For every gram over the average a manufacturer will face fines
of 95 euro per car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal still has to pass the full EU Parliament and the
Council of Ministers. But this is now increasingly likely to
happen, and we'll be defending this package every inch of the
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as a huge blow to the car industry lobby, which
has shamelessly defended its right to drive climate change by
putting profits ahead of the climate. The lobby, led by Volkswagen,
Mercedes and BMW will now have to embrace a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With our gallant activists barely out oftheir orang-utan suits, and with our Dove parody running on YouTube for a meretwo weeks, we were somewhat taken aback by the sheer speed with which ourcampaign has met with success! Sometimes it takes a lot longer to make acompany, corporation or government see the error of its ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;But our work is not yet done! Palm oil isused for a wide range of products – from toothpaste to margarine, and fromwashing powders to soaps. Following our meeting with Unilever last week,agreements on what needs to happen next are now taking shape. Even thoughUnilever is the biggest buyer of palm oil, it represents only three percent of palmoil purchasers. The moratorium will need support from other companies if wewant to see real change in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unilever has agreed to rise to thechallenge and lead the way, building a coalition of allies to put pressure on palmoil suppliers in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;to agree to the moratorium. This includes lobbying all the major players in theindustry, including Kraft, Nestlé, Cadburys, Cargill and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Over the coming months, we’ll be meetingwith companies and urging them to join Unilever in supporting the moratoriumand stopping deforestation and the release of greenhouse gases that fuel climatechange. This coalition of influential players in the palm oil industry –together with the support of palm oil suppliers and the Indonesian government -is key to getting the moratorium in place as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There's still a long way to go to ensure that
the climate is protected from further deforestation, that the
bulldozers leave the rainforest and that orang-utans are saved from
extinction in the wild. We'll be keeping you updated - and we'll be
letting you know if we need your help again to put pressure on any

	Activists turned the front of the Turkish Ministry of Energy into a mortuary to highlight the deadly risks involved with establishing a nuclear industry in Turkey. On the eve of a nuclear tender from the Turkish government, 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group were arrested after they took to the street to protest the dangerous decision.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists were arrested after protesting the possible development of two new nuclear plants in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists unfurled a banner demanding a "STOP" to nuclear energy
and laid themselves on the line with a "die in" on the street in
front of the ministry. The protest ended when the 37 activists were
arrested, but they were later released without charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is currently nuclear-free and is considering nuclear
energy as a quick and cheap fix to its energy needs.  But nuclear
energy is anything but quick or cheap. In addition to being
extremely dangerous and dirty, nuclear energy will be a huge
financial burden on the people of Turkey. Greenpeace is urging the
government to cancel the nuclear tender and invest in clean, safe
renewable alternatives and greater energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not quick but very dirty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the hundreds of billions of US dollars that have been
given to the global nuclear industry in the past fifty years, we
still haven't seen a solution to the issues raised by waste and
security problems. A nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes
of nuclear waste annually. This means an additional 12,000 - 14,000
tonnes of waste are added to the already existing stockpiles of
nuclear waste every year. After recent radiation leaks in Spain and
incidents at plants in France, Sweden and Japan, you can't help but
wonder just how close we are to another Chernobyl. France leads as
an example of how dangerous nuclear energy can be, with
approximately 900 incidents a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear: an economic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with not being able to deal with all the risks, nuclear
power is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs and
construction time, companies do not want to invest. Neither the
World Bank nor the Asian Development Bank will give credits to the
nuclear projects on the grounds that they are too risky
financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means tax payers need to take the burden. The two nuclear
projects currently under construction in Turkey are about three
times over budget, and when the plants complete their lifetime,
decommissioning and cleaning will present yet another bill for the
taxpayer. It is unacceptable that the Turkish government wants to
spend its citizens hard-earned billions of liras on dirty,
dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for an Energy [R]evolution. Let's not fall
back on power from the past. We've come up with a plan to move from
a world powered by nuclear and fossil fuels to one running on
renewable energy. Download the blueprint for an Energy

	The GM food industry suffered another serious setback today as European Commissioners overturned the verdict of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), who had given assurances that three new types of GM crops were safe. For the first time, Europe's most senior lawmakers are publicly doubting the safety of GM crops.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            GMO maize - ringing alarm bells for European Commissioners
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;The EFSA had previouslygiven the green light for a new type of GM potato and two types of GM maize tobe grown. However, when &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt;'s leaders beganto delve into the data on safety of these crops alarm bells rang.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Leading experts from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO), the Institut Pasteur and the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMEA) have already raised concerns about the impact of Germanchemical giant BASF's GM potato on human health. The crop could result in people andanimals developing resistance to certain types of antibiotics which are used totreat diseases. The data on the two types of GM maize wasn't much better.Scientists believe that they could harm wildlife such as butterflies and otherinsects. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;And if this mounting bodyof evidence wasn't enough to make &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt;'sCommissioners sit up and think again, then the 130,000 email messages fromGreenpeace supporters certainly helped them to do so. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Since last autumn, when Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas firststood up to the biotech industry, tens of thousands of environmentalistshave kept the heat on the European Commission about thisissue. We posted comments on Commission blogs, we wrote them emails, we sentthem postcards and petitions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Greenpeace International'sGeert Ritsema certainly thinks that the decision is another nail in the coffinfor the GM food industry. On hearing of the Commission's decision,Ritsema said, "that policy makers at the very highest levels are nowquestioning the safety of GM crops is very significant". &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;"The fact that the Commission has ordered a second investigation also raiseshuge questions over the EFSA’s ability to do its job properly. How can wetrust it to get it right on other crops if it has got it so badly wrongthis time?"  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Of course,scientific opinion means little when the giants of the GM industry areusing every trick in the book to make sure that the crops are given the goahead. It's no secret that the industry has been trying to intimidate &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt; into giving the go ahead by threatening to launcha law suit against the Commission if it didn't agree.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Commission should be given a pat on the back for not caving intoindustry pressure. Having said that, why is the Commission asking the EFSA to look again at the crops when it has shown itself completelyincapable of doing so the first time round?  There is no escaping thefacts. The impact on the environment and on human health of GM crops thatproduce their own insecticides is completely unknown. The Commissionshould have recognised this and rejected the new crops outright. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory! Turkish nuclear plans powered down</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-turkish-nuclear-plans/</url><text>
	Just two days after the arrest of 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group protesting against nuclear energy in Turkey, there has been a victory. For months, the Energy Ministry of Turkey has been intent on selecting a supplier for its first nuclear energy plant. The plant would have been the first of a number the Turkish government says it wants to build. Instead, plans have been stopped dead in their tracks. It turns out energy companies just aren’t that interested in the risk of a new nuclear energy plant.

            Nuclear power presents unacceptable risks to life on this planet: its small contribution to power is far outweighed by its inherent dangers. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And the envelope please…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the government received envelopes from 6 companies
supposedly interested in building the new plant.  Only one envelope
actually held a bid for a new nuclear plant - the other five
contained a "thanks but no thanks" letter. Russian company
Atomstroyexport was the only one willing to roll the dice on
nuclear energy in Turkey. But, Turkish rules say that without
competition for the bid the government is unable to move ahead and
issue the tender for a new nuclear plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey might have been considering nuclear energy as a quick and
cheap fix to its energy needs but nuclear energy is anything but
quick or cheap. In addition to being extremely dangerous and dirty,
nuclear energy is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs
and construction time, companies just don't want to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

	Just a few days into our three-month “Defending Our Mediterranean” tour, and already the Arctic Sunrise has come face-to-face with pirates. In the early hours of the morning, we confiscated almost two kilometres of illegal driftnet, containing dead, undersized bluefin tuna - and a small sea turtle.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mediterranean Sea, Arctic Sunrise - crew of the Arctic Sunrise confiscate a length of illegal driftnet from the Italian fishing vessel Diomede II.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Moving through Greek Ionian waters towards &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;state w:st="on"&gt;Sicily&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/place&gt;, the ArcticSunrise passed a small drifting boat. Its crew had tried to stop their boatfrom being identified by covering its name and registration number; notsomething you’d think of doing unless you were obviously up to no good!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Fortunately for us, we never go anywherewithout a photographer with a camera and a high-poweredtelescopic lens! Confirming that it was the Italian fishing vessel &lt;i&gt;Diomede II&lt;/i&gt;, we checked the EU’s databaseof fishing vessels; it is licensed only to fish within 15 miles (approximately 24 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;kilometres) of theSicilian coast, and then only with longline or anchored nets. The &lt;i&gt;Diomede II &lt;/i&gt;was some 50 kilometresfrom the coast – and, with the seabed being 1500 metres down, we knew theycouldn’t be using anchored nets and could only be fishing with driftnets. So,the Arctic Sunrise’s crew set to work - and managed to haul in almost twokilometres of the driftnet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CqggoesNeCM&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Known as “walls of death”, driftnetscatch everything that crosses their path, including protectedspecies such as whales, dolphins and turtles. They’ve been banned for years bythe United Nations, the European Union, the International Conservation ofAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the General Fisheries Commission for the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt;. Of course, for bans to be effective they have to be enforced. Despite the European Commissionproposing laws to blacklist fishing vessels involved in illegal practices, &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/country-region&gt; and other &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;placename w:st="on"&gt;Member&lt;/placename&gt; &lt;placetype w:st="on"&gt;States&lt;/placetype&gt;&lt;/place&gt;are trying to water these down. Although the authorities confiscate hundreds ofkilometres of illegal driftnet every year, fleets from &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt; and otherMediterranean countries are still fishing illegally.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;And the problem isn’t restricted to the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt;. At the same time as the crew of the ArcticSunrise are busy &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/defending-our-mediterranean-to/"&gt;Defending Our Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, on the other side of the worldthe crew of the Esperanza are busy &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;Defending Our Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve been bearing witness and taking action against purse seine and longlinevessels. They’ve been doing their own bit of turtle rescuing, as well asfreeing lots of other marine life from inevitable death on the longlines. Andthey’re also finding that international laws are being regularly floutedbecause little is being done to enforce them.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;That’s why we’re calling for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;globalnetwork of marine reserves&lt;/a&gt;, covering 40 percent of our seas and oceans,including the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt; and the Pacific:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves will close off high seas    areas currently used as loopholes by pirate fishers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves are vital to ensure that    fish stocks recover;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves are essential to ensure that the fishing industry has a sustainable future;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves will also protect our seas  and oceans from the ravages of climate change and protect ocean life from   habitat collapse and destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;We’ve followedthe &lt;i&gt;Diomede II &lt;/i&gt;back home to itsharbour in &lt;state w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Sicily&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/state&gt;, where it is being met by the coastguard – we’ve asked for the driftnets still onboard to be confiscated. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Quite some homecoming for the pirates (though probably not the sort they were hoping for!). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;And,in the meantime, while it was too late to do anything for the tuna trapped in the driftnet we confiscated, the baby turtle managed to make it out alive! So we’re happy to say that, somewhere in the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean,&lt;/place&gt;there’s at least one baby turtle who’s had the chance to head back home, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Updated, 8 May 2008:&lt;/b&gt; We're happy to
report that the coastguard has confiscated the &lt;i&gt;Diomede II&lt;/i&gt;'s
driftnets! It was a long day for the crew of the Arctic Sunrise -

	Company scores plummeted in the previous edition of Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, when new criteria on climate change were introduced. However, leading brands like Nokia and Samsung are now making significant progress in greening their electronics products, with improved environmental policies responding not only to these new energy criteria, but also to the more stringent chemical and e-waste criteria.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Boys burning electronic cables and other electrical components in order to melt off the plastic and reclaim the copper wiring. This burning in small fires releases toxic chemicals into the environment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of
getting the electronicsindustry to take responsibility for the
entire lifecycle of theirproducts. We want them to face up to the
problem of e-waste and take onthe challenge of tackling climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 and now in its &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
9th edition&lt;/a&gt;, the Guideranks the leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games consolemarkets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals,recycling and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guide has been a key driving force in getting many companies
to make significant improvements to their environmental policies,
and it continues to provoke significant change in the industry.
Intel recently announced that its new Xeon 5400 processors use
transistors made from hafnium, thus avoiding the use of toxic 
Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs). Last week, we also saw the &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/greener-ipods-10092008/" target="_blank"&gt;announcement by Apple&lt;/a&gt; that its new line of
iPods would be free of BFRs, PVC and mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who's in the lead, and who's in need?&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" width="430" height="237"&gt;&lt;param name="width" value="430"&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring seven points out of ten, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nokia-rank-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; has regained the lead, due largely to
its &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/press/reports/take-back-blues" target="_blank"&gt;improved take-back practice in India&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-samsung-ra-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, a top scorer on the energy-efficiency
of its products, takes second place with 5.9 points. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-fse-rankin/" target="_blank"&gt;Fujitsu Siemens Computers&lt;/a&gt; jumps to third place
with 5.5 points, having finally set late 2010 as its deadline for
eliminating toxic PVC plastic and all BFRs from across its product
range. Although &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-erics-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-ranki-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; - who enjoyed the top two positions in
the previous edition - rank fourth and fifth respectively this time
around, they remain in the top half of the ranking with scores of
5.3 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languishing at the bottom of the ranking is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sharp-rank-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; with 3.1, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-microsoft-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; with 2.2 points and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nintendo-r-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, with only 0.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Toxic-free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want manufacturers to eliminate harmful chemicals in their
product design. While no company has, so far, released a computer
completely free of BFRs and PVC, several have recently launched
products with restricted amounts of toxic BFRs and PVC. Sony
Ericsson stands out, having banned hazardous chemicals such as
antimony, beryllium and phthalates since the beginning of the year.
All of its new models are PVC-free. Following the lead set by
companies like Sony Ericsson, and Nokia, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has also announced that its new line of
iPods will be free of BFRs, PVC and mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a first step towards Apple putting its money where its
mouth is: Apple committed to a complete phase-out of PVC and BFRs
from all of its products by the end of 2008. With the new iPods
being the cheapest models yet, this is clear proof that
high-performing electronics products can be affordable, popular and
effective without using toxic chemicals. A downside to Apple's new
iPod is its built-in obsolescence; because of the high costs to
replace the battery, new product purchase is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has positioned itself among the leaders on PVC and BFR
phase-out, but the iPod alone is not enough to increase its overall
score. A complete phase out of all toxic chemicals across its
entire product range would improve Apple's ranking, and the company
needs to improve its record on recycling and climate policy. We're
urging Apple to introduce a free, global recycling scheme like
rivals such as &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-dell-ranki-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Energy-efficient&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 8th edition of the Guide criteria to assess the
companies' performance in tackling climate change have been
introduced. The global Information and Communication Technology
industry is estimated to be responsible for approximately 2 percent
of global carbon dioxide (CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
emissions, and the rapid proliferation of energy-hungry electronic
gadgets is part of this. It's vital that the electronics industry
plays a leading role in producing more energy-efficient products.
Aside from assessing the efficiency of their products, we also
score companies according to how much renewable energy they use and
the level of their commitment to significantly reducing
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top scorers on energy-efficiency of individual products are
Apple, Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Samsung, with &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-toshiba-ra-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; providing a further example of a
company that is improving its climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Responsibly recycled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child
labourers scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by
society's gizmo-loving ways. The latest place where we have
discovered high-tech toxic trash causing horrendous pollution is in
Ghana. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/poisoning-the-poor-electonic/" target="_blank"&gt;recent investigation into e-waste dumping in
Ghana&lt;/a&gt; revealed major companies' products being torn apart in
almost mediaeval conditions, exposing people to alarming levels of
toxic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the company with the
worst position on e-waste and recycling. It ranks 12th with 4.3
points, retaining its penalty point for negative lobbying on
Individual Producer Responsibility in the EU. Put simply, this
means that companies like Philips believe that the costs for
responsible recycling of their obsolete and end-of-life products
should be met by governments and consumers (and that means
you!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips has a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/08/regressive_tv_brand_lobbying_c.html" target="_blank"&gt;bad history of holding this negative stance on
recycling&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Sharp and Sanyo, Philips was a member
of the Electronic Manufacturers' Coalition for Responsible
Recycling, a coalition of TV producers in the US that lobbied
against producer responsibility for financing e-waste recycling and
instead putting this responsibility - and expense - on governments
and the buyers of its products (that means you!). Many companies
left this coalition after being either penalised or threatened with
a penalty in earlier editions of our Greener Electronics Guide, and
the coalition was finally dissolved in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Switching to Green Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more companies now scoring higher than 5 out of 10 - the
halfway mark in the ranking - a company that rises to the challenge
of phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing the recycling rate of
e-waste, using recycled materials in new products and reducing its
impact on climate change could soon find itself &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/searching-for-green-electronics/" target="_blank"&gt;winning the race&lt;/a&gt; to produce the world's first
truly green electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Get email updates about the greening of the electronics industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As the seventh annual Carbon Capture &amp; Sequestration conference gets underway in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Greenpeace has launched 'False Hope' - a report critically examining the status and promise of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The conclusion is that, despite what the coal and power industries claim, CCS will not prevent more than a whiff of global warming pollution from reaching the atmosphere in the next few decades. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/8/smokestackcoalpollution.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/8/smokestackcoalpollution.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal-fired power station smokestacks. Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and the largest single contributor to climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCS aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) emissions from power station
smokestacks and dump it underground. Although it's being described
as a "silver bullet" solution in combating the climate crisis, CCS
has yet to be used on any large-scale coal-fired power plant
anywhere in the world. And, as &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/false-hope/"&gt;
'&lt;i&gt;False Hope&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;/a&gt; reveals, there are huge unknowns regarding
feasibility, cost, environmental implications and liability which
have not been thought through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in greenhouse gas emissions needs to be halted in
the next decade and emissions then need to be cut significantly.
CCS will not be ready in time. Ironically, the suggestion that the
technology may be made to work some time in the future is being
used to justify building new coal-fired power plants without any
form of carbon 'capture'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes most sense is not building coal-fired power plants in
the first place. Carbon is already 'stored' safely underground: we
call it coal. Let's leave it there. Adapting an old phrase, "when
you find yourself in a (climate) hole, the first thing is to stop
digging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a perverse situation where policymakers who claim to
recognise the urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions are
considering bankrolling the development of an unproven technology
over funding proven pollution-free renewable energy sources and
energy efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCS is unproven, risky and expensive and investing in it
threatens to undermine the range of clean energy solutions which
are available right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS not ready in time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate experts say the worst impacts of climate change can be
averted by levelling off global warming pollution by 2015 and
turning down the burner after that. But the earliest that CCS will
be ready is 2030. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change is even less optimistic. The IPCC doesn't
see CCS being commercially viable until even later - around
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS wastes energy and resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capturing and storing carbon dioxide would be a major energy
consumer, gobbling up anything from 10 to 40% of a power plant's
electricity output. So more coal needs to be mined, transported,
and burned for a power station to generate the same amount of
energy as it would without CCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demands for cooling water also increase dramatically. Power
stations with capture technology could require 90% more freshwater
than those without. CCS is expected to erase gains in power plant
energy efficiency made over the past 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one-third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Storing carbon underground is risky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is uncertain whether there is sufficient suitable space
underground to bury enough carbon to have any meaningful climate
impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has no experience of safely storing anything forever.
But locking up carbon dioxide underground in perpetuity is exactly
what would need to be accomplished with CCS. A leakage rate of just
1% could potentially undermine any climate benefit. Tests have
thrown up unexpected results, such CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; disintegrating storage
materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS is expensive and undermines real solutions to climate
change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCS could well mean electricity price rises of between 21 and
91%. Clean energy sources, such as wind power, provide electricity
much more cheaply than coal-fired plants fitted with CCS will ever
be able to. The funding to get CCS off the ground - including
substantial sums of taxpayer's money - comes at the expense of real
solutions. In countries it has been pursued, CCS has taken up an
increasing share of energy research and development budgets whereas
funding for renewable technologies and energy efficiency has
stagnated or declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, for example, the Department of Energy has asked for
the CCS programme budget to be raised to US $623.6 million. At the
same time, it is scaling back renewable energy research to US
$146.2 million. Worse still, legislation introduced on Capitol Hill
would allocate a whopping US $424 billion to a dedicated fund for
CCS. Australia, meanwhile, has three research centres devoted to
fossil fuels, including one committed to CCS, but none for
renewable energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS and liability: risky business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale CCS applications pose significant and new liability
risks, including negative impacts on human health, damage to
ecosystems, groundwater contamination such as the pollution of
drinking water and increased greenhouse gas emissions from
leakage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, energy interests want a free ride by being relieved of
liability in return for investing in CCS. Some demand they be
relieved of ownership of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; at
the power plant gates, or that they remain liable for CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; dumped underground for a mere ten
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs of any mishaps would have to be covered from the
public purse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of support offered to the recently collapsed
FutureGen project in the US gives some inkling of the real costs of
CCS. FutureGen was the Bush Administration's flagship CCS project.
It not only received unprecedented public funds (to the tune of US
$1.3 bn) but was protected from financial and legal liability in
the event of an unanticipated release of carbon, indemnified from
lawsuits and even had its insurance premiums paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The alternative to CCS: renewables and energy efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy and energy saving have proven track records in
meeting energy needs safely, cleanly, predictably and
cost-effectively. The world has sufficient technically accessible
renewable energy to meet global energy needs six times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the risky and expensive option of CCS which is
still on the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details of how clean energy and energy efficiency can cut
almost halve global CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
emissions  by 2050 are contained in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt;

	The Mediterranean Sea is a global treasure. Rich seagrass meadows and rocky reefs dominate its coastal zone while an awe-inspiring array of underwater mountains (seamounts), cold seeps and trenches are found on its seabed. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/coris-julis-over-a-zostera-sea.jpg" title=""&gt;

            Coris julis over a Zostera seagrass bed near Kas, Greece.The Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise is in the Mediterranean for a three-month ship tour taking action on the threats to the sea and calling for a network of large-scale marine reserves to protect the health and productivity of the Mediterranean Sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean represents less than 1 percent of the world's
oceans yet contains some 10,000 species - that's around 9 percent
of the world's marine biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over-fishing and destructive fishing, including continued
illegal use of driftnets, pollution, and rampant coastal
development are steadily eroding this treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Defending our Mediterranean"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, for the third year in a row, is tackling these
threats head-on. With our ship the Arctic Sunrise we are conducting
a 3 month "Defending our Mediterranean" tour. The expedition will
travel across the Mediterranean region exposing and taking action
on destructive activities, documenting areas in need of protection,
and calling for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition is part of our call for a network of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/" target="_blank"&gt;marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; across the Mediterranean, in
both international waters and in coastal regions. Marine reserves -
national parks at sea - are areas where no destructive activities
are allowed, they provide a sanctuary for marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message is simple. "If we want fish tomorrow; we need marine
reserves today".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Threats facing the Mediterranean Sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Bluefin tuna is
on the brink of collapse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majestic bluefin tuna is famous as a symbol of the
Mediterranean. This incredible fish can accelerate faster than a
Porsche and can swim as fast as 43 miles (almost 70 kilometres) per
hour. It is one of the top predators of the Mediterranean
food-chain; crucial to the delicate ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mediterranean bluefin are in serious trouble - "time and
tuna are running out." In 1999, we recorded how Mediterranean
bluefin stocks had declined by 80 percent, and it's getting worse.
Rampant over-fishing and pirate fishing are pushing this precious
species to the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is out of control,
and must be closed immediately to allow the population to recover.
Proper management must be put in place, including marine reserves
to protect tuna breeding areas, if the fishery is ever to become
sustainable again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Driftnets - "walls
of death"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driftnets, known as "walls of death" are primarily used to catch
dwindling stocks of swordfish, but are also responsible for
regularly trapping and killing whales, dolphins and turtles that
happen to cross their path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driftnets have been banned for years by the United Nations, the
European Union, the International Commission for Conservation of
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the General Fisheries Commission for the
Mediterranean, (GFCM). In other words, they are most definitely
illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite millions of euros being spent on decommissioning
driftnets, they are still widely used in the Mediterranean.
Hundreds of thousands of kilometres of these illegal nets are loose
in the waters, indiscriminately killing marine life. In 2006,
Greenpeace confronted and confiscated driftnets from Italian
vessels, including one that had received €28,000 in grants to
change its fishing gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Coastal
development&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seagrass beds are common to shallow seas around much of the
Mediterranean. They are important nursery areas, and help protect
the seabed. They provide a special habitat for small animals and
plants. But rampant development of coastlines for hotels, holiday
homes, marinas and ports is destroying seagrass beds. In the worst
areas they have disappeared altogether; leading to serious loss of
biodiversity and habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2006 Greenpeace Spain recorded that some 1.5
million dwellings and 293 golf courses had been built along 8000
kilometres of Spanish coastline. 116 leisure ports were either
constructed or added to; 102 cases of urban development corruption
were uncovered. The unplanned and reckless nature of this urban
development along the coastline is causing severe erosion and
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Pollution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of tonnes of toxic waste are pumped directly into the
Mediterranean Sea every year. Shipping, urban and agricultural
pollution and tourism are aggravating the crisis. Mercury, cadmium,
zinc and lead in sediments are found at "hot-spots", all too often
located in coastal zones exposed to pollution.  These substances
can travel thousands of kilometres, posing irreversible risks to
human health and marine life across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately one third of the world's total merchant shipping
crosses the Mediterranean each year. Some 370 million tonnes of oil
are transported annually across this busy Sea- that's more than 20%
of the world total.On average 10 oil spills a year happen in the
Mediterranean. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Expedition is calling for Marine
Reserves  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Defending our Mediterranean" will confront these threats, and
more. We are calling for a network of marine reserves to cover
forty percent of the Sea. Large scale reserves to protect
international waters, and a network of smaller reserves to protect
coastal areas and allow fishing grounds to recover and flourish
again. A network of marine reserves for the Mediterranean Sea will
represent a shift in the balance of human impacts, from damage and
harm to protection and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for marine reserves in the Mediterranean is part of
Greenpeace's call for a global network of properly enforced marine
reserves to cover forty percent of the world's oceans. The
Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza is currently in the Pacific
confronting overfishing and calling for the creation of marine
reserves in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
Pacific Commons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today. Add your name to the call to protect the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Stake outs, testimony from informers, hidden cameras and tailing trucks full of stolen goods - it reads like a Hollywood movie, but it was an every day experience for Greenpeace activists in Japan, who have spent four months cracking open a major conspiracy of corruption at the heart of Japan's government-backed, sham scientific whaling operation.

            The proof: the contents of the box were listed as "cardboard."

&lt;b&gt;Latest updates and background on the whale meat
scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We displayed a cardboard box filled with the best cuts of whale
meat, smuggled ashore by the crew of the Japanese whaling factory
ship, Nisshin Maru, for illegal trade and personal gain, at the
Japanese taxpayer's expense. The box, along with videotaped
testimony and other evidence, suggest widespread embezzlement of
whale meat has been occuring for decades under the noses of the
public officials who run the whaling programme, and are allowing it
to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Update, May 20th: You did it! &lt;/span&gt;More than 40,000 of
you wrote to the Japanese government to demand an investigation,
and today the Tokyo district Public Prosecutor has confirmed that
there will one. We will be cooperating in every way possible to
ensure that it is a full investigation, to the highest levels and
not simply the scapegoating of a few individual crew members. While
the investigation is underway, we're demanding that the government
immediately suspend any whaling permits, as well as stop
thetax-payers' subsidy to the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whale Bureaucrats aware of theft from taxpayers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists delivered the evidence, including the whale meat,
to the Public Prosecutor's office in Tokyo, calling on it to make a
full public enquiry into how deep the corruption runs with the
whaling programme. We're also calling for an end to the USD$4.7
million taxpayer subsidies for the programme, and for the license
of the company operating the whale hunt, Kyodo Senpaku, to be
withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhlOxfAljAo"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four-month Greenpeace investigation employed undercover
tactics to reveal dramatic evidence of an embezzlement ring
involving crewmembers on board the Nisshin Maru. Informers who
spoke to the activists claim that senior crew and officials from
Kyodo Senpaku turned a blind eye to the whale meat theft, allowing
it to continue for decades. One informer associated with Kyodo
Senpaku told Greenpeace that officials from the Institute of
Cetacean Research (ICR) - the agency that carries out the so-called
"scientific research" work on board the Nisshin Maru - are most
likely aware of the thefts as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The information we have gathered indicates that the scale of
the scandal is so great, it would be impossible for the ship's
operating company, Kyodo Senpaku, not to know," said Junichi Sato,
Greenpeace Japan whales campaign coordinator. "Kyodo Senpaku is
turning their back on large scale corruption and theft of
taxpayers' money. What we need to know now, through a full public
enquiry, is who else is profiting from the whaling programme? Who
else has allowed this fraud to continue?" Sato added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from information given by former and current Kyodo
Senpaku employees, the Greenpeace investigators secretly documented
the offloading of smuggled whale meat into a special truck, while
Kyodo Senpaku officials and crew members stood by, following the
Nisshin Maru's return earlier this year, on April 15th. Greenpeace
then tracked the consignment from the ship to a depot in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25179/consignment-sheet-detailing-i.jpg" alt="Consignment Label" vspace="4" width="430" border="0" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;Consignment sheet detailing, in Japanese,
the contents of a crewmembers' personal box offloaded from the
whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, containing 23.5 kilograms of
stolen whale meat.  The sheet lists the contents of the box as
"cardboard."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The house that stolen whale meat built&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of four boxes destined for the same private address was then
intercepted, to verify the contents and establish the fraud. The
consignment notes claimed the box contained "cardboard" - but in
reality held 23.5kg of salted 'prime' whale meat, worth up to
US$3,000, hidden beneath overalls. One informer told Greeneace that
dozens of crew take as many as 20 of these boxes each, and said he
overheard one crewmember claim  to have built a house from the
proceeds in stolen whale bacon alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To track down the final destination of this meat, activists
visited pubs and restaurants in a number of different locations
around Japan where they requested "special" meat and filmed the
responses using hidden cameras. Traders and restaurant owners
confirmed that they were expecting the imminent delivery of whale
meat from this year's hunt, despite the fact that the Japanese
Fisheries Agency and the Institute of Cetacean Research do not
release the whale meat for sale before the end of June, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Japanese government-backed scientific whaling
programme, which takes place in the internationally-recognised
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, has been continually mired in
controversy, lies and scandal, bringing Japan into international
disrepute. This latest scandal begs the question of just who
profits from a whaling programme which generates no useful science,
and is commercially unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scandals high and low: how high does this one go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the scandal of stolen whalemeat is the most shocking, it's
not the only revelation to come from this investigation. Further
allegations from our informants that require investigation
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing tonnes of whale meat overboard daily because they did
not have processing capacity for the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cancerous tumours being found and cut out of whales and the
remaining meat processed for public sale&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Targeted hunts to ensure maximum catch, not random "sampling"
as required by the research permits&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Harsh working conditions because of the increased workload from
the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Japanese society already bristling from a litany of public
scandals involving &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jan/18/greenbusiness.recycling"&gt;
recycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071029a7.html"&gt;food

bid-rigging for public works&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST15100620071115"&gt;
bribes for defence contracts,&lt;/a&gt; the whaling industry now joins
the ranks of the dishonoured, as well as earning the scepticism of
an increasingly dubious business community, with business magazine
&lt;i&gt;Shukan Toyo Keizai&lt;/i&gt; suggesting that "&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/02/shukan_toyo_keizai_on_whaling.html"&gt;
the stance of whaling hardliners could also be a vent for
narrow-minded nationalism&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt; newspaper reported
that the whalers &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
were struggling to pay back $1 billion Yen&lt;/a&gt; in borrowed public
funds. With a massive 4,000 tonne stockpile of unconsumed whalemeat
and &lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt; reports of &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
consumer disinterest in "bloody drippings"&lt;/a&gt;, the whalers seem to
be onto a sure loser. To make matters worse, the annual increase in
targeted Southern Ocean whales means that supply is already
outstripping demand, a situation "unthinkable for an ordinary
business entity" according to the accountant of a major audit
corporation quoted by the &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is
funded by the Japanese taxpayers and they have a right to know who
is profiting from their money," commented Sato. "The Japanese
whaling programme has already been shamed internationally for its
lack of scientific credibility, embarrassed by the generation of
vast stockpile of whale meat few want to eat and is now embroiled
in a scandal at home for being corrupt. It is time for the whaling
programme to be stopped and public money spent on something more
honourable." Sato concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/japan-investigate-the-stolen/"&gt;Help us create an outcry for a full investigation and demand the permits of the whalers be revoked.  Write a letter to the Japanese Prime minister. It will only take a minute. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/supportus"&gt;How can Greenpeace continue to bite the hands of governments and corporations? We don't let them feed us, that's how.  But that means we rely on small donations from people like you to keep our investigators undercover, our ships at sea, and our campaigns effective. Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It's been a busy morning for Greenpeace activists across Europe, many of whom have been dressing up as orang-utans to draw attention to Unilever's "monkey business". Today, we're launching the next stage in our campaign to protect the rainforests of Indonesia from the expansion of the palm oil industry.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Orang-utan suited activists scale a Unilever plant to protest Unilever's use of palm oil from Indonesian forests. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that Unilever, maker of Dove and many other
well-known brands, is buying palm oil from companies that are
destroying valuable rainforest and peatland areas; bad news not
only for the millions of people who depend on these for their way
of life and endangered species such as the orang-utan, but also for
the global climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE (1 May 2008):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style="color: #808080; font-size: 80%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good news!
Unilever (Dove's parent company) is feeling the heat from customers
like you, and has made a positive statement. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-palm-oil080501/"&gt;
Read about it here.&lt;/a&gt; We'llmeet with them soon to talk about the
details. For now, we need moresignatures to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/"&gt;
this open letter&lt;/a&gt; and keep spreading the word.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/orang-utans-swing-into-action-to-stop-dove-destroying-rainforests-for-palm-oil-20080421"&gt;
In the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, at the Unilever factory at Port
Sunlight, near Liverpool, sixty Greenpeace activists occupied the
production lines, while in London employees at Unilever's HQ were
greeted on their way to work by screeching mating calls and
orang-utans clambering all over the building. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/news/kettingzaaginunilever"&gt;At
Unilever's Rotterdam HQ, in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, six activists
scaled the waterfront building and hung a banner reading,
"Unilever, Don't Destroy the Forests". In Rome, another ten
orang-utans stopped &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-italy/news/dove-borneo"&gt;Unilever
employees entering their Italian HQ&lt;/a&gt;. Jumping out of a huge box
marked, "Stop Dove from Destroying Rainforests," the orang-utans
handed out flyers outlining the palm oil situation and demanding a
moratium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="311"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2008/4/ss-unilever.swf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Unilever? For a start, Unilever is one of the largest users
of palm oil in the world, funnelling up to 1 in every 20 litres
produced from Indonesia into some of its many products. This means
Unilever has a huge influence on the way palm oil is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, as chair of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO), Unilever has even more clout. The RSPO is a group of
retailers, manufacturers and suppliers whose aim is to create
standards for the production of sustainable palm oil. As things
stand, however, it's little more than a greenwashing operation, as
card-carrying members of the RSPO continue to be involved in the
destruction of Indonesia's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following its creation in 2002, the RSPO set up a certification
scheme, but six years later not a drop of certified oil is yet
available. Even when certified palm oil does become available later
this year, there's nothing to prevent it being blended with
non-certified palm oil. This will make it impossible for RSPO
members to guarantee that their palm oil does not come from
recently deforested areas. All this was documented in our '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/palm-oil-cooking-the-climate/"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Cooking the Climate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;' report, produced last November, in
which Unilever featured prominently. Since then, we've collected
fresh evidence of Unilever's role in deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's actions coincide with the release of our new report, '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/how-unilever-palm-oil-supplier/"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How Unilever's suppliers are Burning Up Borneo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'. The
report details how some of Unilever's key palm oil suppliers -
Sinar Mas, Wilmar, Sime Darby and IOI among them - are devastating
forest and peatland areas in Central Kalimantan. Not only are
millions of people who live in or rely on the forests for their
survival being put at risk, but as these areas are destroyed many
endangered species are at even greater risk of extinction,
including Sumatran tigers, Javan rhinoceroses and orang-utans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also devastating consequences for the climate. As the
forests and tropical peatlands of Indonesia are destroyed and
converted into oil palm plantations, huge volumes of greenhouse
gases are released, accelerating climate change. Indonesia is the
third largest emitter of these gases in the world, in large part
due to the destruction of its forests at the hands of the palm oil
industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not great going for a company that paints itself green
and responsible: take a look at Unilever's website, where it makes
a big deal of its efforts to be both environmentally and socially
responsible. As our report shows, when it comes to palm oil the
reality is very different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want Unilever to clean up its act, not just with the palm oil
it uses in Dove but in all its products. To start the ball rolling,
we've devised a three-point action plan for Unilever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support an immediate moratorium on the destruction of
rainforest and peatland areas in Indonesia to grow palm oil;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;stop trading with palm oil suppliers who are involved in this
destruction; and&lt;/li&gt;

	President Bush has tried again to make the world believe that he will rectify his shameful record of ignoring, denying and fuelling climate change. He's announced that by 2025, the US will stop increasing its emissions. Yes, for another 15 years the country that has spewed more emissions into the atmosphere than any other country on Earth will continue to emit more and more. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A clear message to US President George Bush projected on the Washington Monument.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush must have missed the reports by the Noble Prize winning
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The IPCC
unequivocally says that global emissions need to peak within the
next 10 years at the latest. Ten years, not 17!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush's plan for after 2025 is also lamentable. Bush says, the US
may cut emissions, if coal can be made clean, nuclear power is safe
- and pigs can be genetically engineered to fly. This is a woefully
inadequate response by an administration that has obstructed global
efforts to tackle climate change at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush arrived as an oil man from Texas at the White House in
2001. He leaves as an oil man from Texas in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush made his speech on the occasion of the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bush-s-major-emitters-meeting/"&gt;
Major Emitters Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (MEM)  currently underway in Paris. This
US-driven initiative, launched last year, brings together 16
countries that collectively emit over 80 percent of global
emissions to discuss climate change. But the MEM, like Bush's
speech, is nothing but an attempt by the Bush administration to
deflect attention from its shameful record on tackling climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding emission targets for industrialised countries are the
basis of any meaningful global agreement to fight climate change.
France said as much at the last climate summit in Bali last
December. Climate talks that don't result in binding targets for
industrialised countries are meaningless, France said. Which begs
the question - why is French President Sarkozy hosting this useless
talking shop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCain, Obama and Clinton all support binding emission
reductions for the whole US economy. That is good news, because
Bush is a 'lame duck' and will be out of office when the next
global climate agreement will be made in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries attending the MEM, must listen to Noble Peace Prize
Laureate, Desmond Tutu. In a statement supporting Greenpeace's
position on the MEM he reminds rich world leaders of their
responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many rich world leaders have not, so far, responded to the
climate crisis with the urgency required. Cushioned and cosseted,
they have had the luxury of closing their minds to the real impact
of what is happening in the fragile and precious atmosphere that
surrounds the planet we live on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wonder how much more anxious they might be, if they depended
on the cycle of mother nature to feed their families. How much
greater would their concerns be if they lived in slums and
townships, in mud houses, or shelters made of plastic bags? In
large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, this is a reality. The poor, the
vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh edge of climate
change every day of their lives. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the Major Economies Meeting in Paris, developed countries
must commit to immediate action against climate change. The United
Nations need to deliver an action plan to save the planet at the
climate change conference in 2009. There is no time to be
distracted from the urgent task to deliver this global rescue plan.
The world is watching, and those who are feeling the impacts of
climate change today, are expecting decisive action - now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;US burden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an attendee of the MEM, South Africa's environment minister
immediately condemned Bush's speech by saying: "There is no way
whatsoever that we can agree to what the US is proposing, which
means that the fundamental distinction between developed and
developing countries should be erased and that we should turn a
blind eye to historical responsibility for the problem. In effect,
the US wants developing countries that already face huge poverty
and development challenges to pay for what the US and other highly
industrialized countries have caused over the past 150 years. We
are willing to do our fair share to address the climate challenge,
but not to carry a part of the US's burden."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries participating in Bush's meeting are: Japan,
France, Germany, Italy, the UK, China, Canada, India, Brazil, South
Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesian, and South Africa. The
countries most at risk from impacts of climate change - such as
small island developing states like Tuvalu - are not even invited
to be at the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arieta Moceica of Greenpeace Australia Pacific said from Suva,
Fiji: "While small islands like my own are sinking, Bush and
Sarkozy are wasting everyone's time in Paris at talks that fail to
deliver the rapid emissions reductions we need. The Paris talks
behind closed doors are nothing but a slap in the face of those
already suffering from climate change today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Brussels Seafood Expo - Business Closed! </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/brussels-seafood-expo-230408/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace shuts down tuna trading &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	"Ladies and Gentlemen your attention please, the Dongwon, Mitsubishi, Moon Marine, Azzopardi and Ricardo Fuentes stalls are now closed." That was one message being relayed over the public address sound system at the Brussels Seafood Expo today, as Greenpeace closed down the stands of five  tuna suppliers - including the world's largest, Mitsibushi.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-present-message-dire.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-present-message-dire.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists present message directly at an international seafood fair - "Time and Tuna are running out".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;80 activists from 15 countries covered the stands with fishing
nets, chained themselves to the stands and put up banners in 13
languages saying; 'Time and Tuna are running out'. They also
stenciled the very simple "business closed" across many stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://5am.org/fish/eng.mp3" class="act" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the messages we broadcast at the Expo.
(mp3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no trading at all going on at the Ricardo
Fuentes stand, where 30 people locked on, but trading across the
fair was stopped as people flocked to the stand to see what was
going on. Outside we relayed the same message to people coming into
the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;World's largest seafood trading event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://greenpeace.rack66.com/images/seafood/slideshow.html" style="border: medium none ; width: 100%; height: 350px"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels Seafood Expo is the world's largest seafood trading
event. If you want to see the world's remaining fish stocks
literally served up on a plate, this is the place to come. 1,600
companies from 80 countries are trading their goods, alternatively
known as global marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got our message out today directly to fish suppliers that
unless fisheries go sustainable then neither those who trade in
fish, nor our fish stocks, have a future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There simply aren't enough fish left in the sea to sustain the
world's voracious appetite. The world's oceans are in crisis. Some
two-thirds of fish stocks are either fully exploited or overfished.
Many stocks, such as Mediterranean bluefin tuna and North Sea cod
are on the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing methods such as bottom trawling, purse seining,
longlining, and industrial methods which can catch as much fish in
two days as the fishers of small Pacific Island countries can catch
in a year, are all threatening the sustainability and habitats of
the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the seafood on display at the Expo is either endangered
or has been fished using destructive techniques. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending overfishing and destructive fishing is not only crucial
to saving our marine environment, it is vital to the very survival
of the fishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we told traders today - going sustainable is the only way to
ensure their business has a future. It's not rocket science. In
fact it's really really simple; if you take more fish out of our
oceans than can be replenished - fish stocks will collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Greenpeace has stopped trading of some of the most endangered
species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have stopped business at Mitsubishi - the word's largest tuna
trader, and at Ricardo Fuentes, who not only dominate the Med's
bluefin tuna fishery but are also the biggest company involved in
bluefin tuna ranching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/time-s-running-out-for-tuna-200408/"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25189/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3.jpg" alt="Tuna Overkill" border="0" height="298" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dongwon is active in the Pacific - where our ship the Esperanza
is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/time-s-running-out-for-tuna-200408/"&gt;
currently confronting overfishing and pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and
calling for the creation of marine reserves to protect the Pacific
Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Consumers want sustainable fish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80 percent of European consumers consider the environmental
impacts of seafood as important to their purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for seafood suppliers and retailers to
ensure that they only source or buy seafood that has come from
sustainable sources, and is not fished in destructive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our markets work across Europe has led to many supermarkets
adopting sustainable procurement policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers should not need to ask if the fish they want to buy is
stolen or overfished - retailers need to ensure that no fish that
reaches their shelves is stolen, or depleting the planet's
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for 40 percent of the world's oceans to be
turned into marine reserves - national parks at sea. Marine
reserves are areas closed to all extractive uses, including fishing
and mining. In ocean areas that have already been protected,
threatened species are returning and there is an overall increase
in their variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating marine reserves will do a lot to make sustainable
fishing goals achievable - and ultimately protect the future of the
fishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>India's light bulb phase out: setting a smart example</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/india-light-bulb-phaseout-250209/</url><text>
	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	He may be the most famous humpback whale in the world but Mister Splashy Pants has lots of less famous friends too, all of them named by our supporters around the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Humpback whale swims past the Cook Island whale research boat, enjoying the warm water and the protected reefs of Rarotonga (Cook Islands). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
The Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt; (GWT), we collaborated with scientists
working on humpback whales in the South Pacific. With financial
support from Greenpeace, humpback whales were tagged by the &lt;a href="http://www.whaleresearch.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Cook Islands
Center for Cetacean Research and Conservation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.operationcetaces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Opération
Cétacés&lt;/a&gt; (New Caledonia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the scientists encouragement, we asked our supporters to
help name the tagged whales. The most famous of them is undoubtedly
&lt;b&gt;Mister Splashy Pants&lt;/b&gt;, who came out on top of our online
whale name poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other winners from the poll that are now the proud names of
humpbacks in the South Pacific are, &lt;b&gt;Humphrey&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Aiko&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;Libertad&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Mira&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kaimana&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Aurora&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;Shanti&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Amal&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Manami&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our supporters in Japan also named a couple of whales
with composer &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Ryuichisakamoto-101007"&gt;
Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt; naming a whale &lt;b&gt;Neo&lt;/b&gt; after his son and
Japanese rock guitarist &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/sugizo/"&gt;Sugizo&lt;/a&gt;
naming a whale &lt;b&gt;Lyra&lt;/b&gt; after being inspired to protect the
environment after the birth of his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more whale was named after a school in the Cook Islands
after the children of the school had tried to save a stranded whale
just months before the humpbacks were tagged. The whale was not a
humpback whale but a &lt;a href="http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/CuviersWhale.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cuviers beaked whale&lt;/a&gt; which had stranded itself
on the beach opposite the Ngatangiia school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whale died shortly after it was discovered but became the
subject of an en masse lesson for the kids who watched over it all
day in utter amazement. The children were so moved by the
experience that they named the whale Kakera, meaning 'the rising
sun', which is also the name of the land that the school is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honour of the whale who died and the children who tried to
save it, there is now a humpback whale swimming around in the South
Pacific named &lt;b&gt;Kakera&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another whale was named by the readers of the Daily Telegraph,
anAustralian newspaper. The name they choose was &lt;b&gt;Iluka&lt;/b&gt;, an
AustralianAboriginal word meaning 'near the sea'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 5 whales left to name we turned to our most ardent
supporters, the whale defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Wu from Hong Kong named a whale &lt;b&gt;Siu King&lt;/b&gt; meaning
'smiling whale' in Cantonese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenni Barrett from Ireland named a whale &lt;b&gt;SIDD&lt;/b&gt; after the
first name initials of the three Irish crew members onboard the
Esperanza (&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ara Holden, &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ave Walsh and &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ave
McEvitt ) and one honorary Irish citizen (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;rene Berg - from
Sweden).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitney from USA named a whale &lt;b&gt;Maggie Mae&lt;/b&gt; partly after
her grandmother, aged 83, who is called Margaret (sometimes Maggie)
and partly after the Rod Stewart song of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varga Åskvigg from Sweden named a whale &lt;b&gt;Varuna&lt;/b&gt; after the
Vedic (Hindu) sea God, the protector of the sea and sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloé Banville from Canada named a whale &lt;b&gt;Anaïs&lt;/b&gt; which
means grace in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to all the people who participated in The Great
Whale Trail. With your help, we are another step closer to ending
whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/"&gt;Canon is famous for supporting wildlife initiatives dedicated to protecting endangered species.

	Schwarzenegger says they're "whining", Gartner says they're "sleepwalking". IT industry chiefs can help usher in a new low-carbon era, if only they would lead by example and lobby governments for a strong climate agreement in Copenhagen. That's what our new IT Climate Leadership Challenge is for.

            IT Executive Job Ad: Become a climate leader!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're getting IT companies to make greener electronics. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/"&gt; Philips' recent transformation&lt;/a&gt; to a green leader in the electronics sector shows what public pressure can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to get the industry's heavyweights onto their feet and into the ring, so they help us fight the causes of climate change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT companies need to address their own carbon footprint, which is currently as large as the aviation industry's and growing. That's not enough though. Their influence with governments could be used to counter the lobbying of dirty old industries, intent on wrecking the Copenhagen negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenging all the big names in IT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've laid down the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climateleaders" target="_blank"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;to the CEOs of Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Google, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft,Nokia, Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Sun Microsystems, Toshiba, and Sharp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climateleaders"&gt;Go to the IT Climate Leadership Challenge homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT companies like to do the right thing when they know that consumers and competitors are watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on our quarterly &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, we will be periodically evaluating responses from the companies and will be highlighting those company CEOs who are stepping up to the Climate Challenge and showing true climate leadership in 2009 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory in Greece as the Quit Coal campaign moves to Indonesia</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory_greece_quit_coal_indonesia_120209/</url><text>
	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

	An ancient Japanese legend says that anyone who folds 1000 paper cranes will have their heart's desire come true. On 16 February, 1000 paper whales were delivered to the Japanese embassy in Stockholm with a message "Free Junichi and Toru".From deliveries of origami whales in Sweden, to giant wooden handcuffs in Hong Kong and caged prisoners in Turkey, activists from around the world have been visiting Japanese embassies and consulates this week to call for justice as the Tokyo Two faced their first formal court hearing.

            If calling for an end to whaling in a whale sanctuary and the abuse of tax payers' money is a crime - the Japanese police should get busy!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support has come in from all over the planet. Activists have
been busy in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Turkey, Hong Kong,
the US, Israel, Greece, Russia, New Zealand, the Netherland, Mexico
and India!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, attended a
closed "pre-trial" court session in the Japanese city of Aomori on
February 13th, where they face a politically-driven prosecution and
up to ten years in prison for alleged theft and trespass. The two
were arrested in June 2008, after they exposed &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt;
a major embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the Japanese
government-sponsored whale hunt. They exposed abuse of taxpayer
subsidies in the hope of prompting an independent investigation
into the corrupt whale industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overreaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Two gathered &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt;
firm evidence&lt;/a&gt; that boxes of whale meat were being secretly
shipped to the homes of whaling fleet crew and sold for personal
gain. Junichi took a box of whale meat that had been disguised as
personal luggage from a depot and handed it over it to the Tokyo
Prosecutors' Office in May 2008 while filing a report of
embezzlement. But the investigation was dropped on June 20th - the
same day that both activists were arrested and then held for 26
days before being charged. They were interrogated for up to 12
hours day while handcuffed and strapped to chairs. Toru went on a
hunger strike for a week and refused to speak for 13 days to
highlight his political imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25055/greenpeace-staff-junichi-sato.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Junichi (left), Toru (right), and
their lead counsel, Yuichi Kaido (centre) facereporters at a press
briefing following their first pre-trial hearing at Aomori District
Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Junichi and Toru were released they have not been allowed
to talk to eachother or other Greenpeace activists. They are
forbidden to be away from their homes for extended periods and they
cannot leave the country. They can only speak with
journalistsseparately, in their lawyers' office. Both havebeen
followed by undercover police and receivedanonymous threats after
their addresses were revealed by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strong defence &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Two had no intent of illegal acquisition for personal
gain, which is one of the elements that defines the crime of
"theft" under Japanese law. And their defence counsel is also using
international law to argue that Junichi and Toru were exercising
their right to freedom of expression - guaranteed in the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). If
public watchdogs - such as media and non-governmental organisations
- are to function effectively, freedom of expression is essential.
Any conviction of a criminal offence in this instance would breach
Japan's obligations under the ICCPR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru face a further pre-trial hearing on 23 March,
while the start date of the public trial is yet to be decided. But
they are not facing this alone. Over 250,000 people are standing
beside them in solidarity as &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/arrest-us-091208/"&gt;
'co-defendants'&lt;/a&gt; who have asked Japan to arrest them too if
defending whales is a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/arrest-me-japan/"&gt;
Tell the Japanese government that if they are going to start
arresting people for defending whales, they are going to need a lot
of handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Breaking the ice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to raise awareness in Japan about this injustice and to
promote our other campaigns &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/aomori-commuinications-centre260109/"&gt;
we recently opened a communications centre&lt;/a&gt; in the
northernfishing district of Aomori were the Tokyo Two trial is
being held. And during the Sapporo Snow Festival in Hokkaido we
added some inspiration with an ice sculpture celebrating the beauty
and importance of our oceans. Carved by artist Yasuhiro Sone, the
sculpture included a humpback whale, a dolphin and a tuna - among
other sea creatures - swimming around a globe. The Festival is a
major event in Japan with up to two million visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="Mato Grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/location-of-mato-grosso-in-the/"&gt;Location of Mato Grasso in the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="deforestation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/deforestation-in-the-brazilian/"&gt;Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="cattle ranching expansion" href="/international/en/publications/reports/cattle-ranching-expansion-in-t/"&gt;Cattle ranching expansion in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="original vegatation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/original-vegetation-in-thestat/"&gt;Original Vegetation in the State of Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="slauterhouses and roads in mato grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughterhouses-and-roads-in-m/"&gt;Slaughterhouses and Roads in Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="land use and slauterhouses" href="/international/en/publications/reports/land-use-and-slaughterhouses-i/"&gt;Land Use and Slaughterhouses in Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests.

&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;For the sake of biodiversity, indigenous peoples' rights and the climate, I support Greenpeace's call to cut emissions – not trees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept funds from governments or corporations, but we've been able to support projects like this thanks to individual donations from people like you. Please give what you can to keep Greenpeace Amazon in action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Monitoring the effects of deforestation on the Amazon is a difficult undertaking. The Amazon is huge and it's extremely difficult to keep tabs on what's happening in the remote fringes of the rainforest. News of illegal logging and the spread of soya plantations can take a long time – if ever - to reach the authorities. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/amazonforsoya.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our team in Brazil is working with local communities to map the impacts of the soya industry in the Santarém region of the forest, the heart of soya production in the Amazon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team in Brazil has been working with the local community to map the impacts of the soya industry in the Santarém region of the forest, the heart of soya production in the Amazon. This is a collaborative project with the Brazilian organisations &lt;a title="Projeto Saude e Alegria" href="http://www.saudeealegria.org.br/"&gt;Projeto Saude e Alegria&lt;/a&gt; (Health and Happiness Project) and the Rural Workers Unions of Santarém and Belterra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="community map" href="/international/en/publications/reports/community-mapping-in-the-amazo/" target="_blank"&gt;community mapping&lt;/a&gt; project focuses on training people to use GPS technology to pinpoint the damage caused by intensive agriculture practices and empowering the local community to defend its land and the rainforest. Even though there's a moratorium at present on forest being cleared for new soya plantations, current farming in these areas is still damaging the environment and the communities who live in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research collected for the map between May 2007 and June 2008 shows damage has spread along the highways carved through the forest. Soya farming has affected rivers as well: herbicides used on the crops have leeched into the water. Some rivers have even been dammed by farmers, affecting water supplies for those downstream. Others have silted up when wetland forest cover has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Local groups take control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their environment deteriorates, the future of local communitiesis at stake. Traditional routes through the forest are blocked by expansive soya plantations and people have been forced to sell their land as a result of pollution from agrochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information collected for the maps even documents cases where entire communities have disappeared due to the destruction that has made their former way of life impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communities that continue to exist in spite of the destruction are also on the community map. Many rural communities that have managed to somehow adapt to the destruction are included in this project - for some, this is the first time they have ever been formerly identified on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation of the land in this region is an important step in the fight to save the Amazon. By helping local communities document what's happening to the forest and rivers around them, control is finally back in their hands. Ever since US company Cargill announced its plans to build a controversial soya processing and port facility in Santarém, these communities have fought to show the detrimental effecta growing soya industry has on the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cargill facility was built without the environmental impact assessment required by the government. Cargill finally submitted the assessment to the authorities at the end of last year and we are currently awaiting the announcement of the public hearing where further discussions will take place on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, this mapping project could also provide a model for how the money from global funding mechanisms needed to stop dangerous climate change could be spent to ensure that local people are the guardians of their forests. This will be essential if we are to save the climate and protect forests in the Amazon and around the world in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

	As expert witnesses go, they don’t come any better than Professor James Hansen, one of the world’s leading climate scientists and Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. On Wednesday, he was called to give evidence before a UK Court on the threat posed by Kingsnorth coal-fired power station to the world’s climate. Six Greenpeace activists are being charged with criminal damage after they took action last October, to highlight the threat posed by Kingsnorth.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the worst climate offender
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen's evidence will be crucial in establishing their defence,
since while the defendants accept the damage they caused, they say
they did so to prevent much greater damage to other property and
the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawful damage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial is in its fifth day. The &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-meet-defendants-20080829"&gt;
six Greenpeace activists&lt;/a&gt; are on trial for scaling a smokestack
at Kingsnorth power station in October last year. They have been
charged with causing £30,000 worth of criminal damage for painting
"GORDON" down the chimney. They planned to paint "GORDON - BIN IT",
but they weren't able to because of poor light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defendants accept that they caused the damage, but are
arguing that is was lawful for them to damage the chimney in order
to protect other property in Kent (where Kingsnorth is located),
and around the world, said to be at the risk of much more serious
damage from climate change caused to a large degree by coal-fired
power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Hansen was called to the stand to give evidence.
Hansen has an impressive CV, having spent the last 20 years
studying the Earth's climate. As well as numerous accolades for his
work, he has given evidence to the US Congress and Senate several
times and warned a succession of US Vice-Presidents, including Al
Gore, about the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25128/trial-james-hansen.jpg"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;James Hansen in conversation outside Maidstone Crown
Court&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kingsnorth kills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told the 12 jurors at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent that
emissions from the Kingsnorth power station led to damage to
property worldwide, as well as the extinction of species and the
creation of climate change refugees. During his testimony, Hansen
warned that, if the world continues with business-as-usual, our
descendants will be "left with a much more desolate planet and much
less biodiversity". He said that even a two degree rise in
temperature is "a recipe for global disaster" and that the last
time the Earth was more than two degrees warmer than it is now,
there was a 25-metre sea level rise. He pointed out that the UK
bears the most responsibility for historical CO2 emissions in the
atmosphere per person (followed by the US and then Germany) and
that, if the UK carries on with business as usual, it could cause
the extinction of nearly one million species; several hundred of
these species extinctions could be associated directly with
Kingsnorth power station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25128/kingsnorth.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Live Earth, last year, he was invited to go on stage with
Al Gore. He took his grandchildren along. "How many species do we
need to save?", he asked them. "All of them," said his
grand-daughter. "Me too," said his grandson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can't save all of them," Hansen told the Court, "but we can
still save most." But, although "there's just barely still time" we
need an immediate moratorium on the construction of all new
coal-fired power plants (without &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ccs-not-going-to-save-the-clim/"&gt;
CCS&lt;/a&gt;) and the phasing out of existing coal plants. And somebody
- whether it's the UK, US or Germany - needs "to stand up".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Gordon Brown," he said, "should announce a moratorium on all
new coal plants without carbon capture and storage." Speaking to
the Jury, he also agreed with a statement made by former US Vice
President and Nobel Peace Laureate, Al Gore: "I can't understand
why there aren't rings of young people blocking bulldozers and
preventing them from constructing coal-fired power stations". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Hansen's evidence, another defence expert witness,
Dr Geoffrey Meaden (via video link from Brazil), confirmed that the
examples of climate change impacts being cited by the defendants
are 'true circumstances'. "It is overwhelmingly perceived," he
said, "by the defendants, the scientific community and myself" that
we are changing our climate. "There's an increasing urgency," he
said, "for all citizens and governments to take action." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25128/nonewcoal.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Within five years," said Dr Meaden, "there could be no summer
ice left in the Arctic...Ironically, the Kingsnorth area itself
will be extremely vulnerable to flooding due to climate change. The
situation is so urgent that unless we act immediately to rapidly
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by the next century we may have to
abandon up to 20 percent of Kent to the sea... It behoves us to act
with urgency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taking a stand &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our activists, Emily, also took the stand, and introduced
herself and how she'd come to be involved with Greenpeace. Emily
explained that whatever emissions are in the atmosphere now will
have impacts for years to come. When asked why she climbed the
chimney, she said, "I felt very strongly that I wanted to do that."
And, when the pictures of her hanging off the top of Kingsnorth's
smokestack were handed out, at least a couple of jurors gasped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another activist, Kevin, was next and introduced himself as a
rope access worker from Wiltshire who had become concerned about
climate change back in the '80s. Kevin's questions focused mostly
on the safety aspects of the direct action. Much of the evidence
presented by the expert witnesses was of a highly complicated
technical nature and the 12 jurors really have a tough job to take
it all in. But, in the end, burning fossil fuels causes climate
change that is wreaking massive damage to the environment, the
economy and human health. It is not too late to bring climate
change under control and avoid the worst impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody needs to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/subscribe-kingsnorth-trial-updates"&gt;Stay updated on this trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford the necessary legal support for our activists.

	It's a victory for the Whitsunday Islands and the Great Barrier Reef, with a 20-year moratorium on all new shale oil projects in the region. Led by the Save Our Foreshore group, the success shows just how powerful local, grassroots campaigns can be.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef off the Whitsunday Islands. The proposed shale oil mine would have posed a range of threats to the region.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban has been welcomed by just about everyone but the
QueenlandResource Council, whose proposal was set to mine millions
of tonnes ofshale rock each year on a site just 10 km from the
gateway to the GreatBarrier Reef. The shale oil mine threatened to
drain precious watersupplies, and to risk toxic leaching and air
pollution from waste rock.Shale oil production is extremely
greenhouse gas intensive - emissionsfrom this project, combined
with the company's other plannedoperations, would have raised
Australia's current total emissions by30 percent within 20
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great win but it is madness that such a project could
haveeven been considered. We are facing catastrophic climate change
- wemust urgently cut emissions, not increase them. We don't need
toendanger the Great Barrier Reef or anywhere else by mining
fossilfuels. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/climate-change/solutions/clean-energy"&gt;
There are better energy sources&lt;/a&gt; that are ready to go right now.
If Queensland Premier Anna Bligh canblock this proposal for climate
reasons, we look forward to herblocking other major fossil fuel
projects in the state, includingexport coal expansions, for the
same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined &lt;a href="http://www.saveourforeshore.com/"&gt;Save Our Foreshore&lt;/a&gt; in

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior raises a reaction for the climate in Israel</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rainbow-warrior-raises-a-react/</url><text>
	The Israeli police, supported by the navy, arrested the captain of the Rainbow Warrior - together with 14 Greenpeace activists, the photographer and the videographer - for passing on the message to “Quit Coal”. Activists had been painting the message, in English and Hebrew, on a ship importing coal to the Ashkelon power plant in Israel. Police boarded the Rainbow Warrior before we had even started the painting.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Israeli Marine forces boarded the Rainbow Warrior at the military restricted area near the Ashkelon coal plant before arresting 14 activists together with the captain who were simply asking Israel to "Quit Coal" and "Save the Climate".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Captain, Daniel Rizotti, was arrested by Israeli police. The
officers, arriving on a military ship and carrying machine guns,
came on board and demanded that he sail back to Ashdod, the port we
had left that morning. So, still waiting for the release of our
activists, we sailed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest marked the launch of our "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
Quit Coal: Save the Climate&lt;/a&gt;" tour through the Mediterranean and
Europe. Israel is only the beginning of our journey; we're visiting
11 countries en route to Poland, where crucial UN climate
negotiations continue this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why "Quit Coal"?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, when it comes to climate change, coal is by far the
worst offender.  Yet governments seem to be missing the message,
approving plans for hundreds of new coal-fired plants. If they
don't wake up to the urgent need to stop this, then by 2030 carbon
emissions coming from coal will have increased by some 60 percent.
We're here to sound the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our action in Israel was a wake-up call to the government to
abandon its plans for a new coal plant in Ashkelon. Despite
thousands of Israelis voicing their opposition to this unnecessary
and dirty plant, the government has approved plans anyway. But it's
not too late! &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-israel/news/coal_action_092008"&gt;Greenpeace
is urging all Israelis - whether at home or abroad - to lodge a
complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunny Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is very, very sunny. So it's pretty crazy that Israel is
not embracing this solar potential and instead continues to rely on
imported coal (not to mention the CO2 emissions of shipping the
coal to Israel from Colombia, Indonesia and Australia). Israel is
getting some things right - it has built the world's first solar
thermal plant, and it's selling that technology worldwide.
Something to celebrate indeed. But more is needed for Israel to be
guaranteed a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world must quit its addiction to coal; luckily we have the
cure. Greenpeace's &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/energyrevolution-250107/"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 50%, and deliver half the world's energy needs by
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, we now have our captain, activists, media team,
inflatables and cameras  back on board. We've been deported from
Israel, but now we're heading for Turkey - and the next stage of
our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
"Quit Coal" tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

	In an unprecedented trial a UK Crown Court jury has acquitted six Greenpeace UK volunteers of criminal damage to a coal-fired power plant. The jury, consisting of representatives from the British public, found their actions justified when considering the damage to property caused around the world by CO2 emissions from the plant.

year by scaling the chimney and painting the Prime Minister's name
down the side. The defendants had intended to paint 'GORDON BIN IT'
down the side of the chimney but were served a High Court
injunction by police helicopter, meaning they only got as far as
painting the Prime Minister's first name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/tags/kingsnorth"&gt;Read the
trial updates from Greenpeace UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawful excuse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were accused of causing £30,000 (US$53,000) of criminal
damage to the Kingsnorth smokestack from painting. The defence was
that they had a 'lawful excuse' - because they were acting to
protect property around the world "in immediate need of protection"
from the impacts of climate change, caused in part by burning
coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence used evidence to prove that burning coal inflicts
enormous damage upon ecosystems, people and property across the
planet - and that the UK government was failing to take effective
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first case where preventing property damage from
climate change has been used as part of a 'lawful excuse' defence
in Crown Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NASA scientist called for a moratorium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the world's leading climate scientist, James
Hansen, came to court and challenged the government's plans for new
coal, calling for Gordon Brown to announce a moratorium on all new
coal-fired power plants without carbon capture and storage. The
environmental policy adviser for the UK shadow Prime Minister said
there was "a staggering mismatch between what we've heard from
government and what we've seen from government in terms of
policy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert on climate change impacts in the UK said some of the
property in immediate need of protection from sea level rises
included parts of Kent (Kingsnorth being "extremely vulnerable")
and that "it behoves us to act with urgency". And an Inuit leader
told of his first hand experiences of the impacts of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing all of the evidence, the jurors supported the
right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning
of coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in the light of the verdict, the plans to build a new coal
plant at Kingsnorth (which could emit as much as the world's 30
least polluting countries combined every year for 40 or 50 years)
show that Gordon Brown's government is failing to act on climate
change. Instead they are pumping out policies that are actively
leading us in the wrong (and very dangerous) direction. UK
Ministers now find themselves in a very tight corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;This verdict marks a tipping point for
the climate change movement. It stands as an example to governments
everywhere and an inspiration to people world-wide that they can
and should take a stand against coal fired power stations in
defence of the climate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;Join the Quit COALition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Our work relies on donations from people like you.

	The Arctic Sunrise has embarked on a tour of Brazil to warn against the impacts of climate change and highlight the important role Brazil can play in fighting it.

            Brazil needs to commit itself to targets for reducing greenhouse gasses, eliminating the deforestation of the Amazon
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; sailed through heavy rains into the port of Manaus to an energetic welcome from local partners, state government representatives and media who are lending their support to our campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Save the Planet: now…or NOW" tour will focus on solutions to deforestation and climate change, together with an end to nuclear energy in Brazil. It will also highlight the positive impacts that healthy forests, oceans and renewable energy in Brazil can have on the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this year's crucial UN meeting on climate change in Copenhagen on the horizon - come December the international community will have to start its blueprint for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, it is now or never, as the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; helps spread the urgency of the problem and the need for governments to act on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is clear: in 2015, global CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions must be stabilised and deforestation completely halted in the Amazon. By 2050, we need to have built a zero carbon future. To meet this challenge, we need a global effort to share responsibilities among citizens, governments, private businesses and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the images of the Save the Planet tour's first stop - Manaus and the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise's&lt;/em&gt; first port of call - in what is arguably the most important year for climate discussions - is no coincidence. Brazil plays a pivotal role in the global climate debate as it is currently the 4th largest greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitter in the planet. Furthermore, Brazil is in an important position to combat climate change, being among the 10 largest economies in the world and is the fourth largest emitter of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation and misuse of land, mainly in the Amazon, is responsible for 75 percent of Brazilian emissions of GHGs. The destruction of the Amazon forest releases more than 800 million tonnes ofcarbon dioxide every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil needs to commit itself to targets for reducing greenhouse gases, eliminating the deforestation of the Amazon by 2015, promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency and implementing a network of marine areas to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; will be open to the public at its ports of call.

<item><language>en</language><title>US Congress Announces Ban on Toxic Chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/congress-announces-ban-on-toxi/</url><text>
	The US Congress has sent President Bush legislation that will make toys safer for little tots and infants. The bill bans the use of six toxic chemicals, called phthalates, that are added to vinyl plastic to make it flexible.
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of our supporters wrote members of Congress to help
overcome heavy lobbying by ExxonMobil who manufactures
phthalates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation will cover products made for children up to 12
years of age, ranging from baby teethers to Barbie dolls.
Unfortunately, the new law will not cover vinyl products that
aren't playthings, although every parent knows that everything in
the home has the potential to be sucked on or put in a child's
mouth. Vinyl products not covered by the legislation include car
safety seats, clothing, children's furniture and other vinyl
household products ranging from shower curtains to floor and wall
coverings. The law also does not cover other chemicals such as
bisphenol-a (BPA), which has been found in polycarbonate plastic
baby bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Greenpeace's Toxics Campaign&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1996 Greenpeace has led global campaigns to eliminate the
use of these chemicals in toys and other consumer products. We were
the first organization to expose that vinyl toys contained toxic
chemicals after testing a wide range of children's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;Normal0&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one industry scientist admitted, phthalatesare easily
released from vinyl products like water from a "moist sponge"
whenchildren chew or suck on them. Eliminating exposures to toxic
chemicals iscritical, especially among young children. Phthalates
present a number ofhealth conerns; some are classified in Europe as
'toxic to reproduction' whileothers are toxic to the liver and
kidney, albeit at higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If President Bush signs this new US law, it will permanently
eliminate the use of three phthalates used in vinyl children's
products. It will also ban three additional phthalates until more
thorough safety tests are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Eliminating Toxic Dangers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one industry scientist admitted, phthalates are easily
released from vinyl products like water from a "moist sponge" when
children chew or suck on them. Eliminating exposures to toxic
chemicals is critical, especially among young children. Phthalates
can have a wide variety of health effects ranging from deformation
of reproductive organs to damage to kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinyl plastics or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can contain more
toxic additives than any other plastic. Phthalates are added to
make vinyl soft and flexible and can account for 20 to 30 percent
of the product (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/reports4/this-vinyl-house"&gt;
read our 2001 report This Vinyl House&lt;/a&gt;). Other additives that
have been found in vinyl include heavy metals such as lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Congress and the President Must
Lead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to address these toxic hazards, Congress must take a
bigger step by overhauling US chemical policy. Several states are
beginning to do this and in 2007 the EU adopted a new chemicals
policy (REACH) that prohibits the marketing of chemicals in
products that have not been fully tested for their health
effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;Normal0&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;p&gt; andstipulates substitution of hazardous chemicals by safer
alternatives. In 2009, Congress should finish the job and enact
comprehensive reform of U.S. chemical policy to eliminate these
toxic hazards in products and require the use of safer substitutes
that will protect our families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this new law is a critical first step that ExxonMobil
spent millions to stop, and will likely lean on President Bush to
veto. &lt;b&gt;If you'd like to help you can call the White House today
at +1 (202) 456-1414 and urge President Bush to sign the Consumer
Product Safety Commission Authorization bill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Boulders against bottom trawling  </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/boulders-against-bottom-trawli/</url><text>
	The fishing industry seems determined to catch every last fish in the North Sea.  The governments of the region and the EU have done little to stop them, but  they may soon hit a few snags: a team from Greenpeace Germany and Greenpeace Netherlands has sailed into the German North Sea and begun placing 150 granite rocks on the seabed.  They are hoping that the rocks, each weighing 2-3 tonnes and measuring one square cubic metre, will prevent fishing boats from bottom trawling on the Sylt Outer Reef.  This highly destructive fishing method involves a net being dragged across the seabed indiscriminately catching everything in its path.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bottom-trawling boats drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying fragile underwater ecosystems and decimating fish stocks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling not only decimates stocks of popular fish, such
as sole and plaice, but it also results in a large amount of
bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or
dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Netherlands and Greenpeace Germany are taking direct
action to protect the fragile rocky reef and sandbank habitats and
the many species that are dependent on them. The German Government
and fishing industry are unwilling to address the ongoing
destruction of vulnerable marine habitats and the imminent collapse
of North Sea fish stocks.  We hope that fishermen will now steer
clear of the Sylt Outer Reef and respect it as a marine
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25132/150-granite-rocks-are-being-pl.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, fish stocks are in free fall with around 90 percent of
predatory species, like tuna, having been wiped out since the
1950s. If we carry on with business as usual, very soon there will
be no fish left and no future for the industry. Only in June,
scientists warned that cod stocks in the North Sea are so depleted
that fishing must be halted altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, these warnings have been ignored. Rather than
establishing a marine reserve to allow the North Sea to recover,
European Ministers continue to bury their heads in the sand and
vote to increase catch quotas year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in areas recognised for their high ecological importance,
such as the Sylt Outer Reef, the destruction continues. Not only is
fishing allowed, but also industry extracts vast quantities of sand
and gravel, with devastating consequences for marine habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper these types of activity shouldn't be happening. The
Sylt Outer Reef is protected under European law - designated as a
'Special Area of Conservation' under the EU Habitats Directive. But
in reality this protection is worth little more than the paper it
is written on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are demanding that the German government push the European
Commission to put in place new measures to enforce a ban on fishing
in the area by the beginning of next year at the latest. We also
want the Dutch, Danish and UK governments to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want the German government to immediately put a stop to
the industrial extraction of sand and gravel in the area by
ensuring no new licences are issued.&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest place where we have discovered high tech toxic trash causing horrendous pollution is in Ghana. Our analysis of samples taken from two electronic waste (e-waste) scrap yards in Ghana has revealed severe contamination with hazardous chemicals.

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Boys burning electronic cables and other electrical components in order to melt off the plastic and reclaim the copper wiring. This burning in small fires releases toxic chemicals into the environment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing demand for the latest fashionable mobile phone,
flat screen TV or super-fast computer creates ever larger amounts
of obsolete electronics that are often laden with toxic chemicals
like lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants. Rather than
being safely recycled, much of this e-waste gets dumped in
developing countries. Previously, we have exposed pollution from
e-waste scrap yards in &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25134/recycling-of-electronic-waste.pdf"&gt;
China and India&lt;/a&gt;. Nigeria has also been identified as a &lt;a href="http://www.ban.org/BANreports/10-24-05/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;dumping ground for old electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our investigation into the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/e-waste-toxic-not-in-our-backyard210208/"&gt;
shady e-waste trade&lt;/a&gt;, we uncovered evidence that e-waste is
being exported, often illegally, to Ghana from Europe and the US.
We visited Ghana to investigate workplace contamination from
e-waste recycling and disposal in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the yards, unprotected workers, many of them children,
dismantle computers and TVs with little more then stones in search
of metals that can be sold. The remaining plastic, cables and
casing is either burnt or simply dumped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pr1zQrXM_7s&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the samples contained toxic metals including lead in
quantities as much as one hundred times above background levels.
Other chemicals such as phthalates, some of which are known to
interfere with sexual reproduction, were found in most of the
samples tested.  One sample also contained a high level of
chlorinated dioxins, known to promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Bridgen, from our science unit, has visited scrap
yards in China, India and Ghana: "Many of the chemicals released
are highly toxic, some may affect children's developing
reproductive systems, while others can affect brain development and
the nervous system.  In Ghana, China and India, workers, many of
them children, may be substantially exposed to these hazardous
chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;How does it get to Ghana?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers filled with old and often broken computers, monitors
and TVs - from brands including Philips, Canon, Dell, Microsoft,
Nokia, Siemens and Sony - arrive in Ghana from Germany, Korea,
Switzerland and the Netherlands under the false label of
"second-hand goods". Exporting e-waste from Europe is illegal but
exporting old electronics for 'reuse' allows unscrupulous traders
to profit from dumping old electronics in Ghana. The majority of
the containers' contents end up in Ghana's scrap yards to be
crushed and burned by unprotected workers. &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-trash/carroll-text/7" target="_blank"&gt;Some traders report&lt;/a&gt; that to get a shipping
container with a few working computers they must accept broken junk
like old screens in the same container from exporters in developed
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What's the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working computers and mobile phones can have a new lease
of life in some African countries, they create pollution when
thrown away due to the high levels of toxic chemicals they contain.
This is why we are &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
pressuring the biggest electronic companies&lt;/a&gt; to phase out toxic
chemicals and introduce global recycling schemes. Both of these
steps are vital to tackle the growing tide of toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies are making progress towards taking responsibility
for the entire lifecycle of their products. However, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sharp-8"&gt;
Sharp&lt;/a&gt; stand out for refusing to accept that they are
responsible for recycling their old products. The stance of these
powerful multinationals is ensuring there will always be a digital
divide that they prefer remains hidden, a dangerous divide with
unprotected workers in developing countries left with the toxic
legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>From Italian coal "Banditi" to lauded "Ecopacifisti" </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/italian-coal-activists-040408/</url><text>
	In a rare case of judicial farsightedness an Italian court has thrown out injunctions against 12 of our volunteers who took action against Italy's most polluting coal power plant. The court ruling even stated that the protest was 'justified due to the danger the coal plant to the local area'.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/polluting-coal-plant-itlay.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/polluting-coal-plant-itlay.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Action at the most polluting coal plant in Italy, owned by Enel.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2007 we &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2007/12/labeling_coal_for_what_it_is.html"&gt;
paid a visit&lt;/a&gt; to the Brindisi Sud coal power station, which
belches out nearly 15 million tons of global warming pollution
every year, to label it as the number one Italian cause of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local police responded by slapping unique injunctions on our 12
volunteers declaring them "socialmente pericolosi" (a danger to
society) and banning them from the local area for three years.
Normally only convicted criminals or mafia associates are
considered a "danger to society". This was the first time that
Italian police have used such an injunction for a peaceful
demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N6laJLy-Zqk&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;
&lt;param name="quality" value="high"&gt;
&lt;param name="menu" value="false"&gt;

&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/N6laJLy-Zqk&amp;amp;hl=en" wmode="" quality="high" menu="false" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly the real danger to society is massive coal plants
releasing millions of tonnes of global warming pollution every
year. In response hundreds of Italians also declared themselves
"banditi" for the climate, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.it/banditi/"&gt;posting their pictures on
our website&lt;/a&gt; in support of the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the injunctions were contested in the Court of Lecce the
judge over turned the injunctions and stated: "The demonstration
had justifiable and appreciable motivations in the high
environmental risk the power station poses to the whole area ...
the action has been a reaction to the polluting threat of the power
station, which negates the nature of the intrusion, which in
another case would be unacceptable".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Italian state and energy companies seeking to expand coal
power in Italy, this is clearly someone who can see the huge danger
of coal expansion. He would do a much better job than the
politicians currently in charge of Italian energy policy, like the
Ministry for Economic Development, Mr. Pierluigi Bersani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local community of Brindisi are also taking a stand against
the polluting coal plant. The town council has even proposed a
motion to give the ex-bandits honorary citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No climate for old coal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally plans for new coal plants have been hitting the
buffers. The most polluting form of energy generation is finally
coming under more scrutiny. Only vested interests are refusing to
acknowledge that new coal will blow any chance of meeting vital
climate targets. The plan for the first new coal plant in the UK
for decades has been delayed. In the US, of the 151 coal-fired
power plants in the planning stages during 2007, 59 proposed plants
were either refused licenses by state governments or quietly
abandoned. In addition, close to 50 coal plants are being contested
in the courts, and the remaining plants will likely be challenged
when they reach the permitting stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an Energy Revolution, not new coal. That means
investment in clean energy and enhanced energy efficiency measures.
Investing in renewable energy like wind energy and solar power, or
in combined heat and power plants - which take the excess heat
created by electricity generation and make it available for heating
rather than letting it dissipate into the atmosphere - can deliver
the CO2 savings we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal has no future if we are to tackle climate change - coal's
massive carbon emissions are the real danger to society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/7steps/"&gt;Take seven steps to help tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Quit Coal campaign completes Thailand tour</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/thailand-coal-rainbow-warrior280708/</url><text>
	After successful campaigns in New Zealand and the Philippines, the Rainbow Warrior spent 21 days in Thailand as part of the "Quit Coal, Lead the Energy [R]evolution Tour" promoting solutions to climate change. The tour included human banners, port blockades and a visit to the Ministry of Energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/8/greenpeace-hari-ini-menantang-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/8/greenpeace-hari-ini-menantang-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists brought hundreds of balloons, symbolising carbon emissions from new coal power plants in Thailand, to the Ministry of Energy in Bangkok.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand's energy revolution should be underway already thanks
to a new law that allows residents and villages to generate
electricity from wind turbines or other renewable sources and sell
surplus electricity back to grid. This should help alleviate
poverty and unemployment among Thais as well as generate clean
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds sweet - but the reality looks very different as many
bureaucratic barriers prevent people from taking up this
opportunity. And the lack of a Renewable Energy law that
prioritises green electricity over dirty electricity means that
investors are gearing up to build coal fired power plants instead
of windfarms. Last year even nuclear energy appeared on the
agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tour started on July 4th when the Rainbow Warrior, sailed
into Songkhla. We were launching a Greenpeace petition to the
Ministry of Energy demanding they reject coal, nuclear and other
fossil-fuel energy systems, a petition that was endorsed by over
1500 residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship then moved on to Thapsake on July 9th when hundreds of
local people joined the crew to form a human banner proclaiming
'Quit Coal' on the beach. The Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT) is proposing to build a 4000 MW coal-fired power
plant in Thapsakae but local communities are opposing it due to
concerns about pollution and climate change. These villagers added
their voice to the Greenpeace petition to the Ministry of
Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/prachuab-human-banner5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rayong province, on July 15th the crew of the Rainbow Warrior
staged a peaceful protest against the expansion of a Belgian-owned
coal power plant in Mapthaphut, anchoring a few meters off the coal
wharf and unfurling banners saying "Quit Coal" and "Coal = Climate
Change". The ship was confronted by tug boats and coal plant
personnel who fired water cannons as it entered the coal port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/greenpeace-flagship-rainbow-wa-4.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European energy companies such as the Belgium-based Suez Energy
International, part of the largest energy consortium in Western
Europe are involved with the expansion of the coal industry in
Thailand even though the European Union has committed to
drastically reduce its own carbon emissions by as much as 30
percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bangkok on July 21st we delivered our petition as Greenpeace
activists filled the Ministry of Energy headquarters with balloons
printed with the word "CO2". The balloons symbolize the carbon
emissions from the construction of new coal power plants in
Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/greenpeace-activists-protest-a.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest, most carbon intensive of all fossil fuels.
Energy from coal now accounts for roughly 2 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Emitting 29% more carbon per unit of
energy than oil and 80% more than gas, coal is one of the leading
contributors to climate change. Burning coal also releases massive
amounts of toxic substances such as mercury and arsenic which have
deadly impacts on human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Thai government to quit coal and
increase energy efficiency. The government needs to adopt
legislation that provides investors in renewable energy with stable
and predictable returns and guarantee priority access to the grid
for renewable generators. Thailand doesn't need coal, it needs an
Energy Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Our ships rely on donations from people like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Activists painted messages on twenty coal ships in a queue at Hay Point port in Queensland before getting arrested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists from our ship Esperanza drove up to the coal ships
in inflatable boats, while they were anchored in the queue,
painting the messages along the sides of the waiting coal boats.
Police arrived on the scene after the 20 ships had been painted,
boarded one of the inflatables and arrested 10 activists.&lt;/p&gt;

[R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous Contradiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful action highlighted Australia's Prime Minister Kevin
Rudd's plans to rapidly expand coal exports at a time when the
world is trying to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst
talking about urgent action on climate change Rudd is overseeing
plans for Australia's first new coal port in decades and a doubling
of New South Wales' and Queensland's coal exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days ago in Port Douglas, he warned "Australia must act
locally and globally on the challenge of climate change because if
we fail great assets like the Great Barrier Reef will be fatally in
peril".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is the world's largest coal exporter by far,
accounting for 30 percent of global exports. The plans for coal
expansion in Queensland alone would increase Australia's current
emissions by 80 percent. Emissions from all of the planned
expansions total 729 million tonnes of CO2 - equal to 120 percent
of Australia's current emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new poll reveals that 82 percent of Australians want the
country's coal exports capped or reduced. Is Kevin Rudd going to
shape up to be the climate leader Australians hoped he would
be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his climate change review for the Australian federal
government, Professor Garnaut said that if we do not successfully
combat climate change, the Great Barrier Reef will die and
Australians will lose 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in tourism dollars
each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Queensland: the world's best solar
state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queensland has the best solar resources in the world, but
instead of leading the way in renewable energy, the 'Sunshine
State' has plans to massively expand its export coal industry. The
earth has enough renewable energy to power the globe six times over
forever. In Australia, all that's missing is the political
will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Rudd government acts now, Australia could become a
powerhouse for renewable energy manufacturing and technological
development, creating thousands of new jobs and investment
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having promised action on climate change, to prove he's serious,
Rudd must agree to replace ageing power stations with renewable
energy and halt the expansion of Australia's export coal industry.
Australia can't continue to burn coal and ship CO2 emissions
overseas and say that they are fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Without support from people like you - none of this would be possible. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Europe stands on the verge of a great opportunity. Its fleet of power stations, built thirty years ago is reaching the end of its life. With climate change an undeniable threat, this is a once in a lifetime chance to turn our back on fossil fuels and embrace the energy revolution. A revolution which could bring greenhouse gas emissions under control, and help prevent catastrophic climate change.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists plant 2,008 trees on the construction site of the new E.ON coal power plant in Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam. Ironically today is the, "national day for planting a tree", sponsored by E.ON.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shame then that the power companies who could do most to
support that shift are doing their best to secure another thirty
years of business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Netherlands - trees against coal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, German power company E.ON plan to build a
new coal fired power station, another four are also planned by
other utilities. Last week Greenpeace won an injunction halting the
construction from going ahead because E.ON does not have an
operating licence for the plant, only a construction permit. Our
lawsuit secures a window of opportunity to prevent the construction
from going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seizing the opportunity, today, while E.ON has been seeking to
improve its image by sponsoring "national tree day", around 100
Greenpeace activists celebrated the event by planting thousands of
trees on the proposed site of the company's new power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Germany - giant metal dinosaur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/vattenfall-hq-protest"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25205/vattenfall-hq-protest.jpg" border="0" height="323" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, Vattenfall are another company building new coal
fired power plants. Once again, Greenpeace is leading the fight to
stop them. The three new plants proposed by Vattenfall would pump
out some 18.2 million tonnes of carbon per year. Coal power
stations should go the way of the dinosaurs, and Greenpeace made
that point by delivering a 5-meter tall dinosaur and three tonnes
of coal to Vattenfalls' headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Vattenfall plant at Moorburg the subject of discussions
between Germany's Christian Democrats and Greens, as they seek to
form a new provincial government, there is a real chance to do the
right thing and consign this power plant to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Better ideas on offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal companies try to disguise their filthy investments by
talking up the prospect of implementing Carbon Capture and Storage
(&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/CCS-briefing"&gt;
CCS&lt;/a&gt;) technology. Just one of the problems? We need carbon
reductions now, but Vattenfall say their first 'commercial concept'
will be ready between 2015 and 2020  - too late to make a
difference, even it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe doesn't face up to the coal industry it will have to
face up to the consequences of climate change. Fortunately there is
an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs an Energy Revolution.  That means investment in
clean energy and enhanced energy efficiency measures. Investing in
renewable energy like wind energy and solar power, or in combined
heat and power plants - which take the excess heat created by
electricity generation and make it available for heating rather
than letting it dissipate into the atmosphere - can deliver the CO2
savings we need. More demanding energy efficiency standards for
everything from light bulbs and fridges to cars will ensure the
economy continues to grow even as it decarbonises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/7steps/"&gt;Take 7 steps to help the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	In an historic move, the Romanian Government today announced it will ban genetically engineered (GE) maize and embrace organic agriculture. The move is particularly significant as GE maize is the only commercially cultivated GE crop permitted in Europe.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/8/corn-grenade-the-winning-imag.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/8/corn-grenade-the-winning-imag.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monsanto's GMO corn threatens biodiversity.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister of Environment and Durable Development Mr Attila
Korodi's announcement banning Monsanto's GE maize MON 810, makes
Europe's largest per hectare maize producer GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My ministry is in possession of new scientific studies showing
that GE is not safe for human health or the environment," Korodi
said. "These are the same studies that have recently been used by
other European Union Member States such as France, Hungary, Austria
and Greece to justify the banning of Monsanto's GE maize MON
810...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We expect [the ban] to come into force around 15 April. Until
that time, we demand that Romanian farmers do not plant MON 810
seeds. The future of Romania is organic," he declared at an event
organised by Greenpeace, Slow Food and the Organic Farmers
Organisation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania cultivates about 3 million hectares of maize annually,
losing GE companies an important market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government's decision makes Romania the seventh of Europe's
leading maize producers to ban the growing of Monsanto's GE maize,
following France, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Greece and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/releases/seralini_study_MON863"&gt;
studies&lt;/a&gt; which have been significant in European governments'
decision to reject GE have shown MON 810 maize is harmful to
wildlife, soil and human health. Its inbuilt toxin, which is
designed to kill the cornborer, a pest considered insignificant in
Romania and other parts of Europe, seeps into soil harming animals
critical to soil health, such as earthworms, and other wildlife
including butterflies, ants and spiders. Proof of its safety for
human and animal health are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Romania's GE ban marks a seismic change. It sends a critical
message that this dangerous technology will not be tolerated. It is
vital the European Commission protects all of Europe's farmers,
consumers and environment by introducing an EU-wide ban against GE
cultivation," Geert Ritsema, Greenpeace International GE campaign
coordinator said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's 10-year licence, granted by the European Commission
to grow MON 810 throughout the EU, comes up for renewal later this
year. This provides an important opportunity for the Commission and
European Union (EU) Member States to reject GE once and for
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-eu-unit/press-centre/press-releases2/Dimas-call-for-maize-ban-071025"&gt;
Stavros Dimas&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commissioner for the Environment,
raised concerns over the safety of GE cultivation. But to date his
proposal to ban the growing of two GE maize varieties has been
blocked by President of the European Commission Manuel Barroso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Romanian people overwhelmingly reject this unsafe,
unnecessary and unsustainable technology," said Gabriel Paun, GE
Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace Romania. In 2007, a
Greenpeace-commissioned opinion poll conducted by Mercury Research
showed 67 percent of Romanians do not want to eat GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from safety concerns, GE also poses contamination threat
to natural crops. There have been 216 contamination events in 57
countries since GE crops were first grown commercially on a large
scale in 1996, as Greenpeace and GeneWatch UK's latest &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/gm-contamination-register-2007/"&gt;
GM Contamination Register Report&lt;/a&gt; shows.   Greenpeace is calling
for an international standard to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/gm-ge-contamination-report290208/"&gt;
hold biotech companies to account&lt;/a&gt; for the damage and financial
losses they cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a postcard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/solidarity-send-commissioner"&gt;Send EU Environment Commissioner Dimas a postcard encouraging him to keep standing up for life, biodiversity, health, beauty of nature -- and against reckless industry giants aiming for nothing else than control of the world's food and biodiversity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Japanese whalers have announced that they are struggling to harpoon their quota this year.  As the season draws to a close, they have caught less than half the 985 whales they targeted.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace dogged the whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean, shutting down the whalers for longer than ever before.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping the whaling fleet's factory ship on the run in
January our non-violent protests were vital in frustrating the
Japanese Fisheries Agency's plans, as the whalers tried to avoid
public scrutiny by not killing whales in our presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the support of millions of people like you we could not
have sent our ship, the Esperanza, to the Southern Ocean, or
generated enough controversy to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
cause Japan to call off their humpback hunt before it had even
started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only a couple of weeks left in the hunting season, and
by their own admission the owners of the whaling ships will not be
off-loading anything like the planned 1,000 whales worth of boxed
and frozen whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whale meat from the start of the hunt is due to arrive
back in Japan in the next few days - destined to sit in warehouse
stockpiles as potential whale meat buyers in Japan are themselves
becoming a vanishing species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in January, as well as shutting down the whale operations
for longer than ever before,  we peacefully disrupted the refueling
of the Japanese whaling fleet by the tanker Oriental Bluebird.
Following the refueling, huge amounts of whale meat were
transferred to the Oriental Bluebird for transit back to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird doesn't have a permit as part of Japan's
research whaling fleet, and is flagged as a Panamanian vessel. Both
Panama and Japan have signed the international Convention on the
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which prohibits commercial
trade in species named on its Appendix 1 list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minke whale is an Appendix 1 species, and while Japan has
filed for an exception to the regulations, Panama has not. The meat
now steaming towards Japan all boxed up and ready for sale has,
according to law, been exported to Panamanian territory -- and the
Greenpeace ship Esperanza has photos to document that. Any
offloading of the whale meat in Japan could constitute a violation
of the CITES convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the whale meat is offloaded, we'll be ashore to voice
the opposition of whale defenders around the world. Greenpeace
Japan has been urging supermarkets and restaurants not to offer
whale meat. Three of the top five supermarkets chains have
responding positively. 'Watami', a famous pub chain, with over 600
restaurants all over Japan, has also confirmed that whale is off
the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer and fewer people in Japan are eating whale meat, leading
to declining demand and an unsold stockpile of nearly 4,000 tonnes
of whale meat. In a desperate attempt by the bureaucrats of the
Japanese Fisheries Agency to reverse the trend and create
artificial support for their unpopular product, the whale meat has
been subsidised, pushed into school lunches and even used as dog
food. A company charged with marketing the meat has for two years
running failed to turn a profit, and the whalers this year had to
reorganise payment of an interest-free government loan, as they've
been unable to meet their sales targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial whaling has no future -- whether it's disguised as
scientific research or not.  In Norway, the number one buyer of
whale meat &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/03/will_nobody_buy_their_whale_me.html"&gt;
announced that they're getting out of the whale meat business&lt;/a&gt;.
In Iceland, the Minister of Fisheries &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/08/iceland_to_stop_whaling.html"&gt;
announced last year that no quota was being set&lt;/a&gt; because there
was no market for the whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With steady pressure, we can ensure that whaling is consigned to
the history books forever, and that in future whales are shot by
the cameras of whale watchers, rather than the harpoons of
so-called researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

	A shipping container filled with sawn timber from an eco-forestry project in Lake Murray, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has arrived in Sydney, Australia.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/men-from-the-village-of-aweika.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/men-from-the-village-of-aweika.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Men from the village of Aweikaimqassi work together to prepare a freshly cut tree for milling on a portable sawmill, as part of a local eco-forestry project.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the eco-forestry project, we teamed up with the local
people and set up the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/"&gt;Global Forest
Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt;on the shore of Lake Murray in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue station was used as thebase for surveying the
surrounding forest to determine traditional clanboundaries, and
training for the local communities in land and businessmanagement,
marketing and timber milling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the arrival of the first shipment of taun, rosewood
and red cedar to Australia, Lake Murray landowner, Sep Galeva said
that while it had taken his people a lot of hard work over the last
few years to get the timber exported, this was just the first of
many containers to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#video" class="act"&gt;Watch the video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we have shown is that anybody can do this. Forest
communities around PNG don't have to rely on industrial logging for
survival, they can do it themselves in a way that protects the
environment and keeps the land for future generations," Mr Galeva
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our bad experience with illegal and destructive logging from
the Kiunga Aiambak road project, run by Concord Pacific, made my
people choose eco-forestry instead so that we have control over our
land."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Sam Moko added, "By doing this they
willcontinue to enjoy all the benefits their forests traditionally
providethem and get real income from cutting their timber for
generations tocome."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There has been a lot of pressure on communities in LakeMurray
to sign their land away to logging and palm oil interests
andlandowners need to make informed decisions before they agree to
the bigcompanies, otherwise they could find themselves regretting
theirdecision and facing ongoing social, environmental and legal
issues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"TheLake Murray people involved in eco-forestry have thought
about theiroptions and have decided to take their future in their
own hands."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Lake Murray approached Greenpeace, the Foundation
for People and Community Development (FPCD), Barefoot and other
non-government organisations to help them get their eco-forestry
project off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yati Bun, Executive Director of FPCD, this kind of
initiative is a way for landowners to take charge of their forest
resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We joined the Lake Murray initiative to support landowners
manage the forests themselves and make sure they are getting the
maximum benefits," Mr Bun said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are earning 2-3 times what they would get locally from
logging companies for their sawn timber. Over the long term
eco-forestry provides economic, social and environmental benefits
to local communities, empower them to be self sufficient and
ensures their valuable forest resource survives into the
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want other PNG forest owners to know that eco-forestry is a
viable alternative to logging, and that they can make very good
returns exporting timber to Australia but they also need to know
that it is not easy. If people want to choose to control their own
destinies they must commit themselves to working hard and not sit
back and expect things to just come to them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lake Murray eco-forestry initiative has been supported by
funding from Doen Foundation in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Argentina to 'Ban the Bulb'</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/</url><text>
	As the energy revolution gathers pace in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, Argentina becomes the latest country to announce that it is banning energy wasting bulbs.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A 5 metre high 'ban the bulb' display in front of the Argentinean Congress.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, over 10 countries have committed to banning the bulb with another half a dozen countries planning to do the same or using initiatives to effectively consign the old incandescent bulb to the dustbin of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="#table"&gt;Check out who is on the right path to banning the bulb and starting their energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina's move to ban the bulb by 2010 is the first legislative step taken by a South American country to rid itself of inefficient lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign victory comes after a very active &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/prensa-rss/greenpeace-manifest-su-acuerd" target="blank"&gt;'ban the bulb' campaign by our Argentinean office&lt;/a&gt;. In announcing the move at an energy efficiency conference, President Kirchner praised our campaign by saying, "we are following the proposal from Greenpeace".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela and Cuba have given out the more efficient compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs for free to its citizens whilst Brazil has subsidised the cost of CFL's but none of them have passed legislation banning them outright as Argentina now intends to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A product from the 19th century has no place in today's society. To protect the climate we need to set strong efficiency standards" said Rosario Espina from Greenpeace Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to reduce its carbon output by 80 percent by 2050 if it is to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Banning inefficient lighting is a good first step but it is not enough on its own to stop human induced climate change in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the efficiency of all household appliances, buildings, cars, etc and switching to renewable energy can achieve the required carbon savings to avoid the catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>What is a green electronics product?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/green-electronics-050308/</url><text>
	The Sony Vaio TZ11 laptop, Sony Ericsson T650i mobile phone and Sony Ericsson P1i PDA have come out on top in our first survey of greener electronics products. Some products were more advanced than others, but there's definitely room for improvement as none of them scored over 5/10.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/cebit2008.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A pile of e-waste at CeBit 2008.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25213/searching-for-green-electronics.pdf"&gt;
survey of the main brands&lt;/a&gt; of desktop PCs and notebooks, mobile
phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), assessing them on
their use of hazardous chemicals, energy efficiency, overall
product lifecycle (recyclability and upgradeability) and other
factors such as the promotion of environmental friendliness and
innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#video" class="act"&gt;Check out the e-waste video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted market leaders and invited them to submit their
most environmentally-friendly products currently available. In
addition, we placed ads in trade magazines and on websites
encouraging other producers to participate. Each company could
submit a maximum of three products in each of the product
categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven products were assessed, from fourteen major
electronics brands who agreed to provide information for the survey
at the end of 2007. The companies submitted information on their
most environmentally-friendly products. Sony Vaio TZ11 notebook,
the Sony Ericsson T650i mobile phone and the Sony Ericsson P1i PDA
came out top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best rated desktop came from Dell (Optiplex 755) and HP
(dc5750) but these and other mobile phones, laptops and PDAs didn't
score above 5/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey was based on voluntary participation by companies
willing to submit their products to our critical evaluation.
Unfortunately, not all the companies we invited agreed to
participate, and in the game consoles category in particular we
received either no submissions at all or they came too late to be
included. Non-responders included: Acer, Apple, Microsoft, Nintendo
and Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since submissions closed, several companies have launched
products that showcase new environmental innovations. Nokia's
Evolve phone uses more recycled plastic and has a highly efficient
charger. Apple's Mac Book Air eliminates the use of toxic mercury
and arsenic to raise the bar on toxics reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the electronics industry is moving fast we are at the
world's biggest IT fair - CeBIT in Germany, to check out which
companies and products are on the cutting edge of environmental
innovation. Our experts will be investigating the facts behind the
hype and highlighting the leaders and showing up any superficial
green claims. Check out the updates on green innovations at
CeBIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/electronics/"&gt;
our blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey also reveals that while no individual product could
yet lay claim to being truly green, there are plenty of individual
innovations by different companies in toxics reduction, energy
efficiency, longer lifecycles and recycling. The key to making a
comprehensively greener product is combining innovation in each of
these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to challenge electronics manufacturers to take
responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products - from
production, through manufacture and to the very end of their
products' lives - and to clean up their products by eliminating
hazardous substances and replacing harmful ingredients through
safer alternatives or design changes while producing energy
efficient products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers need to embrace a truly comprehensive approach.
Consumers should not have to choose between a toxic free product or
an energy-efficient one. They should not need to ask if being
recyclable is better than being durable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a product offers all those standards and is marketed with
consumer-friendly services extending the lifespan as much as
possible, then we can say there is a true green electronics product
on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Brazilian environmental agency seems to have finally woken up to the problem of illegally logged Amazonian timber leaving their shores.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/bsle-express-in-santarem-port.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/bsle-express-in-santarem-port.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            BSLE Express in Santarém port in April 2008 after being arrested for carrying Amazon illegal timber to Europe. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian environmental agency seems to have finally woken
up to the problem of illegally logged Amazonian timber leaving
their shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, inspectors from IBAMA (the agency with responsibility
for regulating the timber industry), carried out an impromptu check
of timber cargo ships at the Brazilian Port of Santarem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, Brazilian customs had already given the green light
and the ship was preparing to leave. That is until IBAMA officials
discovered that documents for the cargo on the BSLE Express
contained false information about the species of timber onboard.
This is just one of the ways timber companies try to 'legalise'
timber that has been illegally logged or processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies connected with the shipment were slapped with
fines totaling over 100,000 Euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the first time in two years that the Brazilian authorities
have taken this sort of action, and it follows Greenpeace's recent
blockade at the French port of Caen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember that a few weeks ago we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/amazon-galina170308/"&gt;
stopped the cargo ship, the Galina III&lt;/a&gt;, from entering that
port. The ship was carrying timber that had come from companies
involved in illegal operations in the Amazon, and which was to be
sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Europe imports a huge amount of timber from the
Amazon no one is required to check whether it comes from companies
involved in illegal activities. We wanted to highlight this. The EU
is always saying that it is leading the world in the fight against
climate change, yet here they are inadvertently fuelling
deforestation in the Amazon by allowing illegally logged timber to
be sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This irony wasn't lost on the French government. It issued a
statement calling on the European Commission to tighten up the law
so that all timber sold in the Europe comes from legal sources and
well managed forests. The French Environment Minister, Jean-Louis
Borloo also got in touch with his Brazilian counterpart to work out
what else could be done to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the French government so worried? Because it knows that
unless deforestation in regions like the Amazon is stopped we will
have little hope of preventing the worst effects of climate change.
Tropical deforestation is responsible for about one-fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions - more than the world's entire transport
sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to companies slashing and burning the rainforest in
order to make a quick profit, the rate of deforestation and
resulting greenhouse gas emissions, are actually increasing. Brazil
is now the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind the
US, China and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogue companies operating illegally are driving much of this
devastation. Greenpeace's report - '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/future-for-forests/"&gt;
A Future for Forests&lt;/a&gt;' estimates that up to 80 percent of the
timber from the Amazon rainforest is illegally logged. And, it
isn't just the environmental impact of these companies' activities
that is worrying. Illegal logging encourages land grabbing by
farmers and speculators, and fuels corruption and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why we need to see more of the same from IBAMA alongside
action by the EU to tighten up checks on timber imports. The
prospect of more stringent EU regulation is looking promising. In
response to Greenpeace's blockade in Caen, the President Sarkozy
said he would look at what could be done when France takes over the
EU Presidency this Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediterranean pirates busted by Greenpeace</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Mediterranean-pirates-busted070708/</url><text>
	Activists aboard our ship Arctic Sunrise confronted an illegal vessel, the Luna Rossa, fishing with a driftnet this morning in international waters west of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea. The Luna Rossa’s crew immediately cut the net and fled from our ship at high speed.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/the-pirate-fishing-vessel-lun.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/the-pirate-fishing-vessel-lun.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The pirate fishing vessel, Luna Rossa, cut off its illegal driftnet and fled from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driftnets  - described as "walls of death" because of the way in
which they indiscriminately snare not just their target species,
but everything in their path -  killing whales, dolphins and
turtles in addition to other marine life, have been banned by the
United Nations and the European Union. Our activists retrieved the
illegal net and we reported the vessel to the relevant authorities
in Italy and the European Union - though so far with no
response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;They can run but they can't hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the helicopter on the Arctic Sunrise has been
repaired - &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/attacking-the-messenger300608/" title="The Attack" target="_blank"&gt;it was damaged when the ship
was attacked by Turkish fishermen a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; - and so we
were able to catch up with the Luna Rossa to get its name and
number, despite the crew's attempts to hide this information from
us with tarpaulin, buoys and footballs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were clearly unimpressed about Greenpeace turning up as
they were hauling their illegal catch. They made rude gestures,
exposed their buttocks and hurled abuse at our activists over the
radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="311"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2008/7/ssmeddriftnet08.swf"&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;No time for talking&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is exposing these pirates but the real
responsibility for enforcing the driftnet ban lies with the Italian
government and the European Union. Yet Mediterranean governments
continue to turn a blind eye to these activities, essentially
condoning the crimes and failing in their mandate to protect the
Mediterranean Sea from such acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of fully
protected marine reserves covering 40% of our oceans as an
essential way to protect our seas from the ravages of climate
change, to restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean
life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this campaign, the Arctic Sunrise is currently in the
Mediterranean documenting threats to the sea and promoting the
designation of marine reserves. Our three-month expedition -
"Defending Our Mediterranean" - began in May, and we have already
confronted &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/fishing-out-the-pirates/" title="The other Italian vessel" target="_blank"&gt;Italian driftnet
fishing vessels&lt;/a&gt; and Turkish purse seiners targeting bluefin
tuna. We have also mapped and documented seagrass meadows requiring
protection in Greece and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Sea is in crisis and the industry is fishing
itself to death. Swordfish stocks are dwindling, and driftnets go
on reaping a deadly bycatch. Bluefin tuna is set to share the same
fate as cod in the north Atlantic, and vital fish breeding and
feeding areas like seagrass meadows continue to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are urging all Mediterranean countries to unite and protect
their sea - to stop illegal fishing and preserve their shared
marine resources. Laws without enforcement are worthless. It's time

	Do you know what happens when you throw out your old electronic gadgets? Probably not, but considering they contain both toxic chemicals and valuable metals you'd think someone would know? Unfortunately our new report 'Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard' reveals the fate of millions of tonnes of e-waste generated each year is largely unknown.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of old electronics, or e-waste, such as computers, phones and TVs being discarded every year is growing rapidly. In many countries it's the fastest growing type of waste as cheap prices mean replacing electronics is cheaper than fixing them, while low price often means low quality and a very short life spans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As electronics increasingly become part of the throw away culture in many developed countries, amounts of e-waste have dramatically increased while solutions have often lagged far behind. Even in the European Union (EU) that has tighter regulation 75 percent of e-waste is unaccounted for. Of the estimated 8.7 million tonnes of e-waste created annually in the EU a massive 6.6 million tonnes of e-waste is not recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US there is very little regulation of e-waste. Less than 20 percent of US e-waste is recovered for recycling. Worrying the recycling percentages for PCs (10 percent) and TVs (14 percent) are even lower. The imminent switch to digital TVs in the US and elsewhere will lead to a massive increase in the amount of redundant analogue TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even from the 20 percent of e-waste collected in the US much is exported  because the US is one of the few countries where it's still legal to export collected e-waste to Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/e-waste-china-toxic-label.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;E-waste dumped in China, with a label clearly indicating it was collected for recycling in California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge amount of e-waste not recycled can be accounted for by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Storage: Often old electronics are stored in people's houses. This only serves to delay the day they are finally discarded and reduces the chances they could be effectively reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Landfill/Incineration: When mixed with domestic waste electronics will most likely end up in a landfill or incinerated. Both methods allow toxic chemicals to pollute the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Reuse and Export: Old computers and phones are often exported to developing countries for reuse or recycling. The vast majority are crudely recycled in e-waste scrap yards causing widespread pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Divide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries like India and China have long been a destination for e-waste dumping by unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick profit on e-waste from the US and Europe. Now the amounts of domestic e-waste generated by these countries is growing fast. In India only one percent of e-waste is collected for authorised recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Asia and Africa informal recycling yards have sprung up where low paid migrant workers use primitive methods to extract valuable metals. This informal recycling creates massive environmental pollution and damages the health of workers and residents in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even well intentioned shipments of computers for reuse are being abused. In &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-trash/carroll-text"&gt; Ghana many traders report&lt;/a&gt; that to get a shipping container with a few working computers they must accept broken junk like old screens in the same container from exporters in developed countries. The broken junk and eventually even the working computers inevitably ends up dumped in Ghana where there is no infrastructure to safely recycle toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clear solution is for the major electronics companies to eliminate the worst toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling programs. Having generated demand for the latest new mobile phone or sleek laptop and made vast profits from sales of electronics it should not be a problem the companies are allowed to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/old-mobile-phones-e-waste.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Mobiles at a recycling plant. Only a fraction of old mobiles are recycled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 more than one billion mobile phones were shipped worldwide. However, Nokia (the market leader) recycles just 2 percent of the phones it sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major computer makers do little better, with currently an average recycling rate of just 9 percent. That means the major companies don't recycle over 90 percent of their old products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the rising tide of e-waste all manufactures must offer free and convenient recycling of their products to all their customers. Where companies are unwilling to do this tough legislation is need to ensure electronics are safely recycled. Japan has effective recycling legislation and Sony reports that it collects 53 percent of it's old products in Japan. That's five times better than the global average for major PC makers and shows that solutions are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace calls on Philips to take-back &amp;amp; recycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/philips.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most companies accept responsibility for recycling their own products, and are improving their recycling programs for consumers, several TV companies are dragging their feet on recycling with the majority offering no recycling for old TVs in many countries. Of the TV companies, Philips stands out by publicly stating that recycling is the responsibility for the customer and government and consumers should pay for recycling, not the product makers. Behind the scenes Philips lobbies to avert legislation to make companies more responsible for recycling their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Philips is helping ensure the status quo remains, that has lead to such a large e-waste problem. We have delivered this report direct to Phillips and other companies to show how they need to stop hiding from the problem of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-waste: The good, the bad and the ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since August 2006 we have been &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; ranking the major electronics companies' efforts&lt;/a&gt; phase out toxic chemicals and improve recycling programs - both vital steps to tackle e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies have made big strides to improve their products and recycling schemes since the introduction of the Guide. But no company has so far succeeded in offering an entire range of products free of the worst toxic chemicals or a comprehensive, free, global takeback scheme to ensure responsible recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite. Not accepting corporate donations means we rely entirely on people like you to help keep us going. Some of our corporate targets spend in a few hours what we spend in an entire year. Please help with anything you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>G8 - Environment Nil!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/g8-environment-nil-09072008/</url><text>
	When you're in the business of saving the future - and you give yourself a specific deadline, such as 2050 - you need to make sure that every single day between then and now counts. Unfortunately, the G8 Summit was a waste of three whole days. Gathering in Toyako, Japan, G8 leaders offered nothing new on the food crisis, gave the wrong answer to rising oil prices and deferred climate action. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2005/6/president-george-w-bush.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2005/6/president-george-w-bush.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            George Bush attends his last ever G8 Summit - so it's not all bad news, then...
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our political advisor, Daniel Mittler, who was in Toyako
throughout, has been providing regular updates: from the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/rain_in_a_ski_resort_a_sad_but.html" target="_blank"&gt;wet and dismal start to the proceedings&lt;/a&gt;,
through the G8's &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/solving_the_food_crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;working lunches, working dinners and working
lunches while discussing the global food crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and to the
bitter end - a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/g8_climate_statement_this_is_a.html" target="_blank"&gt;final statement&lt;/a&gt; that showed they hadn't made
much progress whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned from the G8's three wasted days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1.    Never do today what you can keep putting off until
tomorrow...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global emissions have to start falling by 2015 and must be cut
by more than 50 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. With the
G8 countries accounting for 62 percent of greenhouse gas emissions,
it's clear that industrialised countries need to take the lead,
cutting emissions by at least 30 percent by 2020, and by between 80
and 90 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 in fact called on the world to aim for a 50 percent goal
- and not more - in 2050, and failed to give any clear commitments
on mid-term measures; this is simply not good enough. We need
action today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/ENVIRONMENT/EXTCC/0,,contentMDK:21713769~menuPK:4860081~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:407864,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;World Bank Climate Investment Funds&lt;/a&gt; that the
G8 has announced do not even exclude coal, the world's most
polluting energy source. Unless we end our addiction to fossil
fuels and start an energy revolution based on renewable energy and
energy efficiency now, the world of 2050 will be a nightmarish one
indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the G8 leaders have effectively done is postpone the
responsibility for tackling global climate change to future
generations; to the politicians who succeed them, and to the
children who will have to live in the nightmare world of 2050 as
envisioned by the G8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.    Never miss the opportunity - whatever the crisis - to
make a quick sale…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush, Berlusconi and others have used the G8 meeting to act as
lobbyists for their own energy giants, trying to sell dangerous,
expensive and uninsurable nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fact that nuclear energy today is based on risky
reactors, leads to proliferation and security hazards and produces
long lived deadly nuclear waste with no solution for its safe
disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that nuclear power will save the climate is absurd and
downright dangerous. We need solutions based on renewables and
energy efficiency to defeat climate change and ensure true energy
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not even as though it's difficult for the G8 to find these
solutions - we set it all out, loud and clear, for them in our &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25145/energyrevolutionreport.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; last year. Maybe
it's time for the G8 leaders to get their heads down into reading
this report, instead of having their heads in the (hopefully, not
mushroom-shaped) clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.    You can have your cake &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; eat it - so long as
it's genetically modified…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's said, "You are what you eat." Yet, the G8 continues to
support treating our soil like dirt, contaminating our water with
toxic chemicals and the planting of more GE crops that yield less
and fail under bad weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial agriculture has undermined global food security and
led us to a food crisis. Rather than shift public investment to
proven ecological methods that provide higher yields, better food
and more resilience to climate change, the G8 leaders repeat their
usual mantra that countries should rely on the global market for
their food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, Bush, Berlusconi and others have been pushing
for genetically engineered food as the solution to the food crisis.
They pretend that liberalising trade will lower food prices. It has
not and will not - all it will do is drive poor farmers, especially
those in the developing world, off their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need farming that is ecological and biodiverse, rather than
continuing with chemical-intensive farming or pursuing the false
promise of genetic engineering. We need public investment in
research and development on ecological and climate change resilient
farming; the end of funding for GE crops and the prohibition of
patents on seeds; and the phasing out of the most toxic chemicals
and the elimination of environmentally-destructive agricultural
subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time for G8 leaders to admit that their old policies have
failed and that they need to start building a trade system based on
equity and sustainability; that 'business as usual' is not an
option. Instead, they fell back on their usual ritual of calling
for a swift end to the Doha Round of trade talks, failing to
recognise that further trade liberalisation will spell disaster for
poor people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Daniel Mittler's reports show, the G8 leaders had plenty of
food…but little thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4.    Acknowledge the problem, and hopefully it'll go
away…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 acknowledged there are unsustainable biofuels - but
didn't do anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this inaction even more land will be diverted away from
food production - mandatory biofuel targets in developed countries
need to be suspended and legislation introduced to ensure biofuel
production does not threaten food security, particularly in
developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And due to this inaction, even more forests will be felled -
increasing global climate change.  Protecting intact forests is
crucial for preserving biodiversity and combating climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is running out, but the answer to the world's transport
needs does not lie with unsustainable biofuels. In order to satisfy
the rich world's addiction to cars, instead we are simply driving
deforestation, driving the food crisis and driving climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the G8 may have driven through all the climate red
lights and stop signs in Toyako.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5.    Always look on the bright side of life…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Arctic ice is melting, the G8 froze into inaction.
Instead of protecting the climate, the G8 effectively protected the
interests of industry, most notably the nuclear and GE industries.
We're no further forward than where we were a year ago, at the last
G8 meeting in Heiligendamm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;But, the one good thing about this G8
meeting is that it was US President George W. Bush's last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any money from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace blockades Australian coal-fired power station</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-blockades-australia/</url><text>
	Greenpeace activists, including an ex-miner from the Hunter Valley, blockaded Australia's most polluting coal-fired power station to call for an Energy [R]evolution. Entering the plant in the early hours of the morning, 16 activists were able to lock themselves to the conveyors that distribute the coal.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist inside Eraring Power Station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the last activists had been removed from the site,
coal supply had been halted for about five hours - for every hour
supply was stopped, we prevented 2000 tonnes of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; from being released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd's turn to act on
climate change and energy. Greenpeace's Australian supporters are
being asked to sign a petition urging Rudd to commit to phasing out
dirty coal and building a clean, safe and reliable energy future
for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Eraring power station?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia-Pacific's climate and energy campaigner,
Simon Roz, explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to stop fuelling climate change when creating
electricity. Eraring is old and inefficient - it's Australia's
dirtiest coal-fired power plant, sending nearly 20 million tonnes
of greenhouse pollution into the atmosphere every year. It's one of
the eight coal-fired power stations in New South Wales responsible
for half the state's and 13% of Australia's greenhouse
pollution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the activists blockading the coal conveyor was Graham
Brown, a retired Hunter Valley coal miner. He said, "I feel very
strongly that we must start making the transition from coal-power
to renewable energy. Coal communities have been taken advantage of
by coal companies and governments. Renewable energy is the future,
and it's bright. Workers must be retrained and re-skilled so that
they don't miss out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable technology is already there, we don't have to wait 20
years for it - but we need a transition mechanism in place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action came in advance of Australian government's climate
change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, delivering his draft review
on climate change. Any urgent action to be taken on climate change
must include policies that support renewables to replace dirty
coal-fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon Roz says, "Renewable energy can replace coal-fired
power and would be a huge step forward in reducing emissions in
line with Professor Garnaut's recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is just the latest of many countries in which
Greenpeace has released national Energy [R]evolution reports
showing how renewables combined with energy efficiency, can provide
all of that country's energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace released its global &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energyrevolutionreport/" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The
scenario shows how renewables can replace coal by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Energy [R]evolutionary!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;Send a message to world leaders who are meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU and become energy [r]evolutionaries! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Illegal logging often happens in far-off places that are all too easily ignored. That's why we have brought the problem to the heart of Europe - with a 12-metre Amazon tree trunk placed in Brussels to highlight the role of Europe in fuelling the destruction of the world's rainforests.

in Brazil where illegal logging is rampant. The tree has been
placed outside the European Commission's headquarters and contrasts
images of the natural beauty of the rainforest with the ongoing
destruction caused by illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is part of our ongoing campaign to force the EU
to introduce a new timber law. This would see a long overdue ban on
illegal timber being sold in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Environment Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, and other EU
politicians are planning to visit the tree, where our activists
will present them with a plywood postcard reading: 'Stop the
chainsaw massacre! Adopt EU timber law now' to remind them why it
is vital to protect the world's last remaining rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Europe buys millions of tonnes of timber from
areas such as the Amazon, South East Asia and the Congo, where
illegal and destructive logging is rampant. As a result, customers
in Europe, buying products like garden furniture, paper tissues,
and construction materials, are unwitting accomplices in the
destruction of the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, the EU has been promising to introduce
new laws against illegally harvested timber, but those companies
profiteering from illegal logging have been obstructing the efforts
being made by the European Commission. However, on July 23, the
European Commission will finally vote on whether to adopt a new
law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the European Commission hasn't got much choice
if it is serious about tackling climate change. We urgently need to
stop destroying the world's forests. Practices such as illegal and
destructive logging drive deforestation, which in turns leads to
the dramatic loss of species and accounts for one fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our supporters have been instrumental in making sure
that the issue hasn't fallen off of the Commission's agenda. Since
June 17, over &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;
65,000 letters have been sent&lt;/a&gt; to the EU President, José Manuel
Barroso. Progressive companies working in the timber industry have
also been pushing for the new law - they are suffering at the hands
of rogue businesses involved in illegal and destructive logging who
undercut prices, make sustainable wood less competitive and harm
the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU already has strict controls on illegal music, software
and films. It's high time timber stolen from the world's last
rainforests was just as strictly controlled as pirate CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;Please write to President Barroso today for a strong EU timber law.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Mister Splashy Pants just heard that two of his Greenpeace pals have been arrested.  He, too, is amazed that they've been locked up for exposing the truth -- and he's going to do something about it. Are you?

            Whalebreak: Free the Tokyo Two

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace activists expose an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;
embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; involving whale meat which is costing
Japanese taxpayers millions of yen. Forty cops swoop down on the
Greenpeace offices to arrest the Greenpeace activists instead of
the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global storm follows: hundreds of thousand of supporters &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;write to the Japanese
government&lt;/a&gt;. Diplomatic protests are lodged by whale-friendly
governments. Vigils and demonstrations are held outside Japanese
embassies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story prompts people all around the world to take
extraordinary action. Now another hero steps up to do what must be
done. Help Mister Splashy Pants free the Tokyo Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is this Mister Splashy Pants dude, you ask? In the real
world, he's a humpback whale we &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
tracked with a satellite tag&lt;/a&gt; heading from the Solomon Islands
toward the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary -- that safe haven in
which the Japanese government kills around 1,000 whales every year
for "scientific research." He was named in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Splashy_Pants"&gt;online
competition&lt;/a&gt; in which his share of the 100,000 votes clobbered
all rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Japanese whalers were heading toward the Southern
Ocean planning to add humpbacks to the whale species they kill
every year. Public pressure from whale supporters worldwide brought
diplomatic protest to bear, however, and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
Japanese backed down on plans to kill humpbacks&lt;/a&gt; -- for now,
anyway. (They still kill minke and fin whales, but our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/551-whales-too-many-140408/"&gt;
direct non-violent actions helped ensure they killed fewer of them
this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants was saved by whale activists like you,
Junichi and Toru. So he reckoned it was time to return the favour.
Help him out by spreading the word: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;Free the Tokyo
Two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Twenty of our activists have successfully stopped construction of a new nuclear reactor being built in Flamanville, France, from restarting, for over 50 hours. Although building was halted because of safety problems, these are still unresolved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/6/le-24-juin-2008-des-activiste-9.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/6/le-24-juin-2008-des-activiste-9.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            24 June 2008, France - Greenpeace activists block the entrance of the quarries where gravel and sand are taken to the site of the EPR nuclear reactor in Flamanville. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists have been blocking three quarries that supply the
gravel and sand for the concrete needed to build the foundations of
the reactor. The peaceful direct action is in response to the
French Nuclear Safety Authority's (ASN) decision to allow
construction to resume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASN has done this despite the fact that none of the safety
problems that stopped building in the first place has been
addressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactor is a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-factsheet/"&gt;
European Pressurised Reactor&lt;/a&gt; (EPR), the flagship of the
so-called "nuclear renaissance". So far, construction of the EPR
has only started in Finland and France and both experiences have
been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE : 27 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; After 60 hours our activists were
removed from the last of the three quarries, by which time they had
prevented almost 400 deliveries of gravel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to continue we have moved our activities to the town
of Caen in Normandy where we are now blocking the concrete supplier
which provides all the concrete used in the construction of the
reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update : 30 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; We are continuing the blockade and
are still preventing concrete pouring at the nuclear construction
site from resuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;Chronic safety problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, the ASN ruled that construction at Flamanville must
stop. It did this because of chronic problems that have affected
the quality of the construction work since building began in
December 2007. These include issues relating to the quality
control; problems with reinforcement and concrete for the
foundations and with metal and welding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the French nuclear industry was unable to pour
concrete for the base correctly. It's a discovery that gives little
confidence that they will be able to handle masses of radioactive
material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ASN reversed its decision, so we had to take action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday the activists stopped some 3000 tonnes of gravel
(30 lorry loads going 4 times a day) from being taken from the
quarries. Some activists have been evicted, but the blockade
continues - with more people arriving from across Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace "eye in the sky" airship delivers "Non! to nuclear"
message to Finland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems at Flamanville echo those of the first EPR
construction site, &lt;a href="http://www.olkiluoto.info/en"&gt;Olkiluoto
3&lt;/a&gt;, in Finland. At the same time as the French blockade, a
Greenpeace airship is delivering a clear anti-nuclear message in
Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 43-metre long black and yellow "eye in the sky" airship
bears a banner showing a shattered radiation symbol and the words
"Non Merci!" On Tuesday it flew by the Finnish reactor site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since construction began in 2005, the estimated costs of the
reactor have nearly doubled to just short of €5 billion- and yes,
it is taxpayers who are left to foot the bill. Two and a half years
behind schedule it has been plagued with safety problems. A list
produced by Finnish regulators included 1500 "quality deviations" -
read faulty. Finnish energy industry figures show, that when, and
if, it finally comes online it will only deliver a third of the
greenhouse gas emission reductions originally promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear power undermines solutions to climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Non Merci!" message is in French because it's a direct
communication to the French government and the state-owned
companies EDF and Areva, who are not only attempting to build in
Flamanville, but are aggressively promoting the fault-ridden
reactor design across the world, claiming it to be a low-cost
"mature" technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: despite the multi-billion Euro spin of the
nuclear industry, nuclear power undermines climate protection, by
diverting urgently needed resources away from real solutions. Our
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; blueprint shows that renewable energy, and
greater energy efficiency can deliver half of the world's energy
needs by 2050, without nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments must heed the stark warnings from Olkiluoto and
Flamanville and just say "Non!" to France's dodgy nuclear
salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Global protest continues to mount with protests and vigils in front of Japanese embassies around the world and more than 180,000  190,000 200,000 letters being sent to the Japanese government demanding the release of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki -- the Tokyo Two. A network of Japanese lawyers have called the arrests a violation of human rights and a challenge to the freedom of expression in Japan.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists conduct peaceful protests at Japanese embassies around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru have been under arrest since the 20th of June,
held without charge. On Tuesday, July 1st, a hearing will be held
on whether they will be detained for a further ten days without
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru exposed a whale-meat embezzlement scandal on
May 15th by presenting a box of whale meat stolen by crew of
Japan's so-called "scientific whaling" fleet, to the Tokyo Public
Prosecutor along with a dossier documenting how they obtained it. 
The scam, in which prime cuts of whale meat are smuggled off the
ship by crewmembers and sold outside official channels, appears to
have been running for years with the full awareness of the
officials that conduct the whaling expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="slideshowmx" align="middle" height="311" width="430"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme is funded by taxpayers, at a cost
of 500 million yen a year (4.7 million)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosecutor's office took up an investigation, but concluded
there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges against any of
the crew or whaling officials. The only consequences in the case
were for the Greenpeace activists, who intercepted a box of meat as
evidence, and were arrested in dramatic raids on their homes and
offices, conducted by around 40 police officers in front of
television cameras.  The police seized documents, computers, cell
phones, and the Greenpeace Japan supporter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;"The response by the Japanese authorities can only
be described as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;excessive, unjust and politically motivated...Rather than trying
to silence those who point out corruption, the police should be
investigating the government officials, whaling fleet operators and
staff who smuggle whale meat from the so-called scientific
programme funded by Japanese taxpayers and sell it for profit. This
and the ongoingwhaling operation in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is where the forces of justice should be focussed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="source"&gt;Gerd Leipold, Executive Director, Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other voices in Japan are saying that the arrest was a warning
to other activist groups that as the G8 approaches, voices of
dissent in Japan will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=4853" target="_blank"&gt;Kyodo&lt;/a&gt; Reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;    While he disagrees with
Greenpeace's anti-whaling stance, journalist Takao Saito said the
way the police arrested the two men and the way they investigated
the group was heavy-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"(Greenpeace) is functioning as a
whistleblower in our society so the authorities should give them a
fair hearing to what they have to say."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WATCH, a network of laywers keeping an eye on human rights in
Japan in the run up to the G8, issued a &lt;a href="http://watch08summit.blogspot.com/2008/06/we-strongly-protest-against-detention.html"&gt;
statement&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"The arrest of the two activists is
not only a human rights violation with regard to the unjustifiable
arrest, detention and investigation, but also a challenge against
the freedom of expression. Police repression against the activists'
denunciation obstructs the legitimate activities of both Japanese
civil society and international society and is therefore
internationally unacceptable and subject to global criticism as an
affront to humanity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supporters have launched protests from Budapest to
Sydney, Sao Paolo to Jakarta, Athens to Washington, and points in
between:&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers embarks on a synchronized propaganda campaign aligned with Alberta's "rebranding" of its oil-extracting tar sands project, Greenpeace has launched its own website to paint the greenwash in its true colour: a deep, oily black.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/"&gt;TravellingAlberta.com&lt;/a&gt;
is a tongue-in-cheek travel site that uses humour to communicate a
very serious issue to Canadian and international audiences about
the destructive nature of the world's largest industrial
development. The website showcases  some of the unique attractions
that await travelers to Alberta: Black sand beaches, toxic lakes
and clearcut forests. Until now, this kind of vacation destination
was merely the stuff of science fiction; but now, it can be
experienced first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We thought we'd help the province and the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers  with their "rebranding" campaign by
bringing Alberta's newest tourist attractions to the world's
doorstep. Any visitor to the Alberta tar sands can see the
pollution, smell the sulfur, taste the toxins and hear the air
cannons - we're saving them the trip," says Mike Hudema, a tar
sands campaigner with Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Premier Ed Stelmach and theCanadian Association of Petroleum
Producers can spend 25 million dollars of tax payers' money trying
to cleanup the image of the tar sands, but this development is
still dirty, ugly and foul. That money would be much better spent
cleaning up the tar sands themselves, rather than just the global
image."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a real cleanup of the area is still a way off, the
current state of northern Alberta offers a rare treat for the
seasoned globetrotter who is craving something new. A seemingly
endless expanse of bitumen-laden sands - coupled with the powerful
scent of oil from refineries wafting through the hazy air - makes
Northern Alberta a truly one-of-a-kind destination. As families
make their vacation plans, TravellingAlberta.com offers these
adventure tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversion surfing:&lt;/b&gt; Catch a wave, Alberta-style, and join
Big Oil in taking advantage of the nearly 92 billion gallons of
water diverted from provincial rivers each year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal sightings:&lt;/b&gt; Moose playing in tailings ponds, loons
drenched in tar and ducks sinking in oil: it's not everywhere that
you can see some of Canada's most prized wildlife in these unique
settings. Hurry though! They're going fast!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tailings sailing:&lt;/b&gt; Come enjoy the vast lakes of toxic
water, so big they're visible to the naked eye from space! Chase
that horizon, but be careful not to capsize!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun in the sun:&lt;/b&gt; Forget Cancun, Alberta is sizzling!
Boasting more greenhouse gas emissions than Canada's three other
most populous provinces combined, it's really heating up out
here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will promote the website internationally, calling on
visitors to share the site with friends and to write Premier Ed
Stelmach, Travel Minister Cindy Ady and Prime Minister Stephen
Harper to demand they put the brakes on tar sand development.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>International law broken to pursue whaling</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/international-law-broken-290308/</url><text>
	The international convention that helped save the elephant and rhino from extinction at the hands of poachers is now being ignored by the Japanese Fisheries Agency to continue whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/activists-demand-illegal-whale.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/activists-demand-illegal-whale.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists in Japan demand illegal whale meat aboard the Panamanian-flagged Oriental Bluebird be refused by customs. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 22nd 2008, we documented with photographs and video
the transfer of whale meat from the Japanese registered factory
whaling ship, the Nissin Maru, to the Panamanian registered cargo
ship, the Oriental Bluebird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), it is illegal to trade
animals and plants listed on Appendix 1 across international
borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird has now docked in Tokyo Bay to unload it's
cargo of minke whale meat, completing the international trade that
started in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary over two months
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 of CITES lists nearly 900 plant and animal species
and includes all the 'great' whales like humpback, fin and minke
whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has filed what is known as a 'reservation' to the listing
of many whale species on Appendix 1, which allows it to ignore some
restrictions on trade in minke whales. But, because Panama has
ratified the treaty without reservations, it cannot commercially
import or export minke whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfering the whale meat from the Japanese registered Nissin
Maru to the Panamanian registered Oriental Bluebird, which then
unloads the meat in a Japanese port is therefore illegal under both
the rules of CITES and Panamanian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan's research whaling programme is a national
embarrassment," said Greenpeace Japan Whales Project Leader Junichi
Sato, "it is riddled with illegalities and instances where
international law has been bent, broken, and bypassed; it continues
to strain relations with our allies around the world and tarnish
Japan's reputation. It's time for Japan to stop whaling in the
Southern Ocean forever."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was set up in 1973 to protect animals
and plants against over-exploitation through international
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Get your FREE Greenpeace newsletter delivered straight to your inbox with all the latest whale news and ways you can help end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for good by making a donation today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Lignite mine expansion stopped in Czech Republic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Czech-lignite-stopped131108/</url><text>
	Thirty of our activists have shut down a giant excavator in one of the largest lignite mines in the Czech Republic. We're calling on the Czech Republic to close this mine by 2012, commit to progressively decreasing their carbon emissions and to play a constructive role in the creation of effective climate policy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Lignite (brown coal) causes global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers from eight countries together with local people peacefully stopped the 50-metre high excavator and laid out a huge banner demanding an end to climate and landscape devastation. Other banners spelled out the fact that if the world does not immediately begin to phase out mines and coal-fired power plants the United Nations climate talks taking place in Poznan in December and Copenhagen next year are destined to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Czech Republic and Poland have attempted to torpedo new and ambitious European climate legislation and it is up to older EU members and particularly the current French presidency to stand firmly against the sabotage of EU climate legislation by some new member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lignite is for losers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lignite, often referred to as 'brown coal', is one of the most carbon intensive fuels. The Czech Republic has the world's second highest lignite production per capita and fourth highest CO2 emission per capita among all European states. If the mine, where our action took place, is enlarged - it is likely that Czech CO2 emissions from lignite combustion will double this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape of Northern Bohemia, once called "the Garden of the Czechs", has been turned inside-out by giant open-cast mines in the last 50 years. During the communist regime, more than 80 towns and villages were destroyed and their inhabitants forcefully resettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlargement of these mines not only endangers the climate, but would also have a detrimental impact on local people. The entire town of Horní Jiřetín - home to two thousand inhabitants and a precious baroque church - will totally dissapear. Locals, with support from Greenpeace, have successfully held on for the last four years in the face of aggressive negotiation efforts from the mining corporation - &lt;span style="font-size: 80%"&gt;ČSA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pending parliament act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their hopes now lie with the proposed Mining Act Amendment, now pending in the Czech Parliament. The proposed legislation will provide a clear legal basis for the closure of all lignite mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My country is coal-addicted and it is almost too late to heal it," said Vladimír Buřt, deputy mayor of the town of Horní Jiřetín, who participated in the protest. "Our national government promised the people of Northern Bohemia that it would start phasing out opencast mines 17 years ago. Now it is time to fulfil this promise. We strongly urge our parliament to adopt new mining legislation that will effectively protect our homes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action in the Czech Republic is just one link in a global chain. OurQuit Coal campaign - led by our flagship the Rainbow Warrior - supported by anearth shaped base station in Poland has been urging governments andenergy companies to quit coal and save the climate in Oceania, SouthEast Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean. And we're taking this message to the climate negotiatons in Poznan, Poland this December. &lt;/p&gt;

            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of getting the electronics
industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want
manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We
want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers
scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's
gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 the Guide is now on its 8th
edition. It ranks the top market leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games console markets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals and take-back. It has been a key
driving force in getting many of the companies to make significant
improvements to their environmental policies. New to this edition
are &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/improved-criteria-explained/"&gt;
criteria&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of electronics companies on
tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="237"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25153/ranking-guide-8th-edition.swf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are scored on disclosure of their greenhouse gas
emissions, commitment for absolute cuts in their own emissions and
support for the mandatory global emissions reductions that are
needed to tackle climate change. On energy efficiency, a selection
of each company's product range is assessed to see how far they
exceed the current de-facto global standard, the US Environmental
Protection Agency's &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home.index" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Star&lt;/a&gt;. Energy Star sets minimum standards
for energy efficiency for many types of &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductCategory&amp;amp;pcw_code=HEF" target="_blank"&gt;electronic products&lt;/a&gt;. The overall percentage of
renewable energy in a companies total energy use is also
assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector
currently accounts for two percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions, equal to the aviation industry. As one of the most
innovative and fastest growing industries, the biggest electronics
companies must show leadership in tackling climate change by
reducing both their direct and indirect climate change
footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our international toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska has noticed
stark contrasts while compiling the Guide: "Electronics giants pay
attention to environmental performance on certain issues, while
ignoring others that are just as important. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt;, for example, scores well on chemicals and energy
criteria, but scores a zero on e-waste since it has no global
take-back polices. Philips would score higher if it took
responsibility for its own branded e-waste and established
equitable global take-back schemes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies score well on energy efficiency as their products
comply and exceed Energy Star standards. The best performers on
energy efficiency are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sony-Ericsson-8"&gt;
Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electrnoics-Apple-8"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt;, with all of their models meeting, and many exceeding,
Energy Star requirements. Sony Ericsson stands out as the first
company to score almost top marks on all of the chemicals criteria.
With all new Sony Ericsson models being PVC-free, the company has
also met the new chemicals criterion in the ranking, having already
banned antimony, beryllium and phthalates from models launched
since January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple missed a big chance to advance its score by not improving
the environmental performance of the new version of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies that promote their 'green' policies come up short
when measured against global standards of measuring impacts on
climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Dell-8"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt; scores relatively poorly while Toshiba, Samsung and LGE
score close to, or zero, on climate change criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the games console makers, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Microsoft-8"&gt;
Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; drops to second bottom of the Guide with a low score
on climate criteria. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Nintendo-8"&gt;
Nintendo's score&lt;/a&gt; increases slightly with some improvement on
toxic chemicals and climate policy. However, even Nintendo's
relatively energy efficient Wii console does not meet Energy Star
standards that cover minimum &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers"&gt;
energy efficiency standards for PCs and consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real green leaders?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most companies now scoring less than 5/10, only a company
that rises to the challenge of phasing out toxic chemicals,
increasing the recycling rate of e-waste, using recycled materials
in new products and reducing their impact on climate change can
seriously hope to make the claim of being green.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Reports: Japanese government gives in, slashes whale quotas</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/whale-wars-quota-cut-131108/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;First ever reduction in minkes to be targetted by "research whaling" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Good news for the whales comes in threes.  And then you get a dollop of extra. Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's biggest newspapers, reports there will be a 20 percent reduction in the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hunt this year -- the first reduction since 1987.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace challenges whaling in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report cites lack of demand for whale meat, pressure from protests at sea and the continued opposition from Europe and Australia as reasons for the reduction in the minke whale quota from 945 minke whales to 750. The quota of 50 endangered fin whales remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news follows hard on the heels of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whaling-disarray-121108/"&gt; Greenpeace revelations&lt;/a&gt; that theindustry has been unable to crew this year's voyage with anall-Japanese crew for the first time, that the traditional ceremonyseeing the fleet off from Shimonoseki has been cancelled, and that'Yushin,' the flagship whale meat shop and restaurant in Asakusa,Tokyo, will close shop in 2010 due to ongoing financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4,200 tonnes of unsold whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reports on the closing of the Yushin restaurant, the whalers cited a lack of supply, rather than a reduction in demand, as the reason for their financial problems.  But the Institute for Cetacean Research's own figures show 4,200 tonnes of whale meat sitting surplus in storage -- an increase over last year, and Asahi's article points to a trend that our own polling confirms: fewer and fewer Japanese people are eating whale meat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those polls also confirm that very few Japanese citizens even know that their tax money is being used to prop up the whaling industry.  We're pushing that message out through our office in Japan, and believe that as the Japanese people learn more about how much whaling costs, and how corrupt the programme is, domestic pressure will become key in the government deciding to hang up the harpoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing the beginning of the end of whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary," said Sara Holden, our International Whales Campaigner "If today's reports are true we congratulate the Japanese government for making this first step, but they can and must go further and we will not stop until the quota is zero."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Years of campaigning paying off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Japan reduced its take, it was due to the moratorium on commercial whaling, which we and a handful of other environmental groups fought long and hard to win from the world's oceans to the halls of the International Whaling Commission. That single piece of work has saved thelives of tens of thousands of whales and ended the whaling programmesof the Soviet Union, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan used a loophole which allows the killing of whales for "scientific research" to continue whaling in the Southern Ocean, though at a far reduced rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has sent ships to interfere with the hunt in the Southern Ocean nine times since the Japanese government research whaling programme in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary began 20 years ago, including keeping them on the run for more than two weeks last season, saving hundreds of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winning in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition inside Japan is also growing thanks to the work of our Japanese office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year two Greenpeace activists in Japan were arrested for exposing corruption within the whaling programme.  Whaling in Japan has had little press attention, but that changed when we unveiled boxes of stolen whale meat on live television, prompting calls from Japan's media and the Tokyo public prosecutor for a full investigation of abuse of taxpayer's money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;our own activists were arrested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political prosecution of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki has been denounced by Amnesty International and, in a periodic evaluation completed last month, the United Nations Human Rights Committee severely reprimanded the Japanese government for the "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression" in Japan. It also condemned the abuse of trespass laws by Japanese police to harass activists who are critical of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The extreme reaction by the authorities shows Greenpeace's work in Japan has put the whaling establishment under pressure" said Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "The whale meat market has clearly collapsed and is unprofitable, and the stigma of scandal and corruption has made it an unattractive and less lucrative industry to work for. The whaling industry's days are numbered, and it's time for the Japanese taxpayer to demand the government stops subsidising this bankrupt programme."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If Japan is going to start rounding up political prisoners for the crime of defending whales, they're going to have to arrest a whole heaping lot of us. Sign the petition to stand in solidarity with Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/support-us"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no government or corporate money to ensure we can bite the hand of any environmental criminal.  The donations of millions of people like you keep us independent. Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate Rescue Station launched against coal in Poland</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-rescue-poland121108/</url><text>
	We have set up a Climate Rescue Station on the edge of a vast open pit coal mine in Konin, Poland. The Rescue Station is a four storey tall planet earth and will be used as a platform to tell the world that we can save the climate, but only if we quit coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels. The Station will remain in Poland for five weeks in the run up to, and during, the United Nation’s Climate Change Conference taking place in Poznan between 1st - 14th of December. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the worst single climate offender
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from 15 different countries will be staying at the station to tell the story of how coal is affecting the entire planet. Coal is the single greatest threat to our climate and we are highlighting this by hosting a variety of high profile events and protests in and around the Climate Rescue Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth dome - using electricty generated from clean renewable energy - is a visual representation of the climate tipping point that the earth is currently perched on - showing the dark future ahead of us if we don't get serious and quit coal now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quit Coal - Save the Climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Climate Rescue Station is part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt; global Quit Coal campaign&lt;/a&gt; which has featured actions and events this year in Oceania, South East Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean - led by our flagship the Rainbow Warrior. She is currently on an expedition in Europe that is urging governments and energy companies such as German owned E.ON - to give coal the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland depends on coal for 93 percent of its power, yet it will play host to the international climate talks next month. Poland should set an example to the rest of the world beginning a coal phase out and switching to clean energy sources while implementing energy efficieny measures. Unless all governments make concrete plans to shift to clean energy instead of increasing their reliance on coal - we will face catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 8th, the Climate Rescue Station will be moved to Poznan Wolności square, where it will continue to send a message to delegates attending the climate talks to get serious about climate change, quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our message to delegates in Poznan will be simple - in order to save the climate - the world has to quit coal. And we can do it. Technically accessible renewable energy is capable of providing six times the energy the world currently consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get serious - start an energy [r]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energy-r-evolutionsummary/"&gt; Energy [R]evolution report&lt;/a&gt; shows how renewable energy, combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by over 50 percent while delivering half the world's energy needs by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is widely recognised as one of mankind's greatest challenges in the 21st century. It is accelerating faster than we previously thought and much of it is caused by the continued and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. The poles are melting, coral reefs are dying and millions of people are at risk from droughts, floods, sea level rise and extreme weather events. The impacts will intensify as global temperatures continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is threatening life as we know it. There is simply no time to lose. Unless we get serious and take meaningful action now - climate change will seriously harm economies, societies and ecosystems all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments are talking of saving the climate most are allowing hundreds more coal-fired power stations to be built that will dramatically increase CO2 emissions. We can tackle climate change, but only if we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Philippine's leg of Quit Coal tour wraps up</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philippine-s-leg-of-quit-coal/</url><text>
	“We believe there is no place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no place for coal in Albay”That was the statement of Governor Joey Sarte Salceda, setting the tone for our one month Quit Coal tour of the Philippines. Since the Rainbow Warrior arrived in the country we’ve taken our Quit Coal message to the places it needed to be heard, and generated real progress on the ground and in the corridors of power.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers light candles in front of Jaro Cathedral - sending a message supporting Iloilo people's demand to the Philippine government for a cleaner, safer, future powered by renewable energy. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pagbilao, we went into action to blockade shipments of coal.
The peaceful actions of our local activists and the crew of the
Rainbow Warrior helped secure commitment from leading politicians
to bring the Renewables Energy Bill to the floor of the Philippine
Senate. The bill has already been passed by the Philippine
Congress, but had been ignored by the Senate. Now we've secured the
support of influential senators, including the chair of the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a coal-free Philippines.
The threat of climate change demands a shift towards a sustainable,
clean and low carbon future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taguig City, we painted the Quit Coal message onto the
driveway of the Department of Energy. Head of that department is
Secretary Reyes, who as chairman of the Presidential Task Force on
Climate Change should have known better than to sanction the
construction or expansion of nine coal fired power stations in a
country with huge renewable energy potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iloilo City, we constructed a climate camp to show our
support for the residents of Iloilo City who are fighting to avoid
the construction of a new coal fired power plant. At events
organised with the Catholic Church and local civil society group
RISE (Responsible Illongos for Sustainable Energy) we brought home
the message that the Philippines is one of the countries most at
risk from global warming, and that burning coal is the single
biggest source of CO2 emissions and a major cause of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we moved our camp to the site of the proposed coal fired
power station to bring our message to the local communities who
will be affected by the new power plant. Tensions ran high when
workers from Panay Power Corporation acting under orders from their
management tried to dismantle the camp and cut off the activists
from the outside world.  Our response was to take our protest to
Metrobank, one of the largest banks in the Philippines and the
owners of Panay Power Corporation. This is just the beginning of a
grassroots campaign to put pressure on the financiers behind the
coal plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour concluded with visits to Antique and Boracay. In
Antique local governor Salvacion Z Perez declared her province coal
free saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earth has provided us with renewable energy. It is time to
harness this energy to generate electricity, and it is our aim to
drastically [reduce] and ultimately stop the use of fossil fuels
especially coal as source of energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boracay, we launched our "Save the climate, Save Boracay"
project, part of an initiative to enlist top island destinations in
South East Asia to reduce their carbon footprints. The people of
Boracay face inundation from rising sea levels, but are determined
to set an example to the world with their use of renewable energy
and efficient energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior carries the Quit Coal message on to Thailand
now, but work in the Philippines continues through our South East
Asia office and allies in civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;We're sending a message to world leaders who will be meeting at the G8 summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU by becoming energy [r]evolutionaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

	More than 80 activists occupied the site of E.ON's proposed coal fired power-plant in Antwerp Harbour – setting up over four thousand tiny windmills and painting the message "Flanders Quit Coal" on the tarmac.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/activist-display-a-banner-at-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/activist-display-a-banner-at-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Less than 12 percent of the 50 billion euros E.ON plans to spend between 2008-2010 to expand its power generation will be on renewable energy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action illustrates the choice facing the Flemish
authorities. They can allow the construction of another climate
changing coal power plant or invest in wind power and greater
energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also meeting with the Cabinet of Flemish Minister
President, Kris Peeters, to debate how the region can take concrete
steps towards a future free from dirty coal and dangerous nuclear
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://greenpeace.rack66.com/images/quitcoal/slideshow.html" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" width="430" frameborder="0" height="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German electricity provider E.ON envisages the construction of a
huge coal power plant in Antwerp. The plant would emit some 6
million tonnes of CO2 per year. This is equivalent to half of what
is already coming from Belgium's six other coal power plants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just say NO!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels. A third of all
CO2 emissions come from coal and, if business continues as usual,
this could increase to 60 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.ON plans to spend 50 billion euros between 2008-2010 to expand
its power generation across Europe. But only 12 percent of this
will be invested in renewable sources of energy. E.ON plans to
build eight new coal plants in Germany, Belgium, the UK and the
Netherlands (costing around1.2 billion euros each) and to construct
another 2000MW of coal-fired capacity in the rest of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plug into the wind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action comes after the Rainbow Warrior demonstrated the
potential of a North Sea electricity grid by simulating the
connection of the first Belgian offshore wind farm to those of
neighbouring countries. The interconnection of North Sea wind farms
would increase the reliability of clean wind energy and allows it
to be combined with other renewable energy sources, like hydraulic
energy from Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ships the Arctic Sunrise and the Rainbow Warrior have been
bringing the "Quit Coal" message to the Mediterranean and Europe,
during a four month expedition, in the run-up to crucial UN climate
negotiations in Poznan, Poland, this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to kickstart an energy [r]evolution that will save the
climate - the world needs to give coal the boot NOW!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay updated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/quit_coal/"&gt;Read the Quit Coal blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to support our activists and keep our ships running.

&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Cetacean Research, which conducts Japan's whaling programme, and Kyodo Senpaku, which operates the whaling fleet, this week announced the closure of the whaling industry's flagship 'Yushin' whale meat shop and restaurant in Asakusa, Tokyo due to ongoing financial problems. The shop, an iconic symbol of whaling in Japan, will close its doors in 2010.  That's the same year that the Jarpa II research programme -- under which whales are killed in the guise of "scientific reserach" will be reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, informants inside the whaling industry tell us that for the first time the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet will not be 100 percent Japanese-crewed, due to the resignation of many crew members following the recent &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-meat-scandal-questions180708/"&gt; whale meat embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; exposed by Greenpeace in May 2008.  Our undercover investigation found that valuable cuts of whale meat were being smuggled ashore by the crew of the Japanese whaling factory ship, Nisshin Maru, for illegal trade and personal gain, at the Japanese taxpayer's expense.  One crewmember had boasted that he had built a house on the proceeds from his personal whale meat sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25101/yushin-wale-meat-shop-asakusa.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="295"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the air of scandal, it's not surprising that the whalers may also be cancelling their traditional departure party.  We received reports of the potential cancellation of the traditional high-profile ceremony in the whaling fleet's home port of Shimonoseki, which  marks the departure of the whalers for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The fleet is expected to depart later this week, from another port, where it will be seen off only by families of crew members and officials from the whaling operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We busted their refrigerator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of embarrassments follow last month's deflagging of the whaling fleet's refueling and cargo ship, Oriental Bluebird, after being ruled in violation of a number of domestic and international regulations as a result of work Greenpeace and local environmental groups took to inform Panamanian authorities of irregularities in the ship's operation.  The Oriental Bluebird had a Panamanian flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As any commercial operator knows,  when your business is universally condemned, when you can't hold onto your staff and when almost no one will buy your products  - its time to shut it down", said Sara Holden, our International Whales Campaign coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although whaling officials claim the decline in business is due to a lack of supply, the Institute for Cetacean Research's own figures flatly contradict this; the stockpile of whale meat is actually increasing, which shows  that there is no market for whale meat in Japan." According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, there were 2800 tonnes of whale meat in storage at the beginning of 2008, which has increased to 4200 tonnes by September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Orwellian: Expose a crime, get arrested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's campaign to end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary has increasingly focused on the authorities in Japan, where 71 percent of the public do not support Japan's whaling programme. As a result of the Greenpeace investigation into embezzlement of whale meat from the factory ship Nisshin Maru, Japanese authorities mounted a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-meat-scandal-activists-11-07-08/"&gt; politically motivated prosecution of two Greenpeace activists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, known as the Tokyo Two, have been denied their liberty for 145 days, since exposing the corruption. They will be put on trial early next year, and face up to 10 years in jail for intercepting whale meat stolen by crew from the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International has denounced the arrest as being politically motivated, and in a periodic evaluation completed last month, the United Nations Human Rights Committee severely reprimanded the Japanese government for the "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression" in Japan. It also condemned the abuse of trespass laws by Japanese police to harass activists who are critical of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The extreme reaction by the authorities shows Greenpeace's work in Japan has put the whaling establishment under pressure" said Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "The whale meat market has clearly collapsed and is unprofitable, and the stigma of scandal and corruption has made it an unattractive and less lucrative industry to work for. The whaling industry's days are numbered, and it's time for the Japanese taxpayer to demand the government stops subsidising this bankrupt programme."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If Japan is going to start rounding up political prisoners for the crime of defending whales, they're going to have to arrest a whole heaping lot of us.  Sign the petition to stand in solidarity with Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Yet another nail has been put in the coffin of Japan's dying whaling industry. We've managed to get the Oriental Bluebird, re-supply and transport ship of Japan’s whaling fleet, de-flagged and fined, following a legal ruling by Panamanian authorities. We are now calling on Japan to scrap the illegal vessel together with the rest of the whaling fleet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/6/whalekilled2.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japan's "research" whaling program continues to fail on all accounts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird, used to refuel the Japanese &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/"&gt; whaling&lt;/a&gt; fleet inthe Southern Ocean and to ship whale meat back to Japan, was found to be in violation of a number of domesticand international regulations by Panamanian authorities. On October 8th it was fined themaximum penalty due to violations relating to its permissible use, the safety of human life and thepreservation of the marine environment.  In human speak, that means that the ship, which was only supposed to be refuelling the fleet (in one of the most fragile and pristine environments in the world) was not supposed to be transporting whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They should scrap the entire fleet - not just the fridge!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to chalk up this victory.  Last year, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whaling-fleet-illegal-refueling210108/"&gt; we took action against this ship in the high seas&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the fleet from refuelling, and joined with other environmental groups in Panama to demand the vessel be de-flagged.  We asked why a ship flagged by Panama was allowed to deliver whale meat to Japan, when Panama, as a party to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, is specfically  forbidden from any such trade. Panama asked a more basic question: why was it transporting whale meat at all when it only carried permits for refuelling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25108/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a flag the owners of theship, Hiyo Shipping Co. Ltd in Japan, will be urgently looking for anewflag State. But it would make a mockery of international maritime lawif Japan continued to rely on the services of this vessel. They shouldscrap it and end the annual hunt in the Southern Ocean WhalingSanctuary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Or will they make a mockery of the law?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has ratified an international treaty which seeks to end the practice of 're-flagging' vessels in order to circumvent international environmental law. The treaty bars Japan from authorising a ship to participate in the exploitation of marine living resources for at least three years, if that ship has changed its flag after being found in breach of international conservation measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waste of money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Oriental Blooper' is currently docked in Shimonoseki, Japan, the home port of the whaling fleet, which is due to depart on its so-called scientific whale hunt in the next few weeks. In addition to the millions of taxpayer yen spent subsidising the whaling operation; the Japanese government has this year added an extra 800 million yen (US$8 million) for a coastguard ship to act as so-called "protection" for the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tokyo Two face ten years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two of our activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, are being prosecuted in Japan and are facing up to ten years in jail, for&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; exposing an embezzlement scanda&lt;/a&gt;l at the heart of the whaling programme. Their arrest was clearly a politically motivatedattempt to stifle opposition to the whaling programme. We're demanding that the chargesagainst them be dropped immediately -- along with the entirewhaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vast amounts of taxpayers' money is being spent to defend the indefensible and militarise a hunt of endangered whales inside an internationally designated whale sanctuary, for a programme that is neither scientifically nor economically credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time for Japanese taxpayers to wake up to the full scale of illegality and corruption in the whaling programme, and to ask why whales continue to die for nothing more than to line the pockets of a few Japanese government bureaucrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Whales are threatened by overfishing, pollution and climate change in addition to whaling. No-take marine reserves will give them the protection they so urgently need. Join the call for a global network of marine reserve including a fully protected Southern Ocean. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	Mice fed on genetically-engineered maize produce fewer offspring than those fed on natural foods, according to a new study published today by the Austrian government.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/antigmoprotest.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/antigmoprotest.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace "mice" were already protesting at the risks to health and the environment from GMOs back in 2005.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian scientists performed several long-term feeding trials with laboratory mice over a course of 20 weeks. One test - the so-called "reproductive assessment by continuous breeding" showed that mouse parents fed on a diet containing 33 percent of a Monsanto owned GE maize variety (NK 603 x MON 810) experienced a decrease in litter size and weight by the time they gave birth to their third and fourth litters. Mice fed on a closely-related non-GE maize had normal reproduction cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of mice and men…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bmgfj.gv.at/cms/site/attachments/3/2/9/CH0810/CMS1226492832306/forschungsbericht_3-2008_letztfassung.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; is further evidence that the food and feed safety of GE crops cannot be guaranteed. The biotech industry is playing a game of genetic roulette with our food and with health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reproductive ramifications of this GE maize were totally unexpected - regulators around the world have previously considered this variety to be as safe as non-GE varieties: a potentially devastating error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alone should be a good enough reason to close down the whole biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protect consumers, not Monsanto's interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Austrian study should be carefully considered by food safety agencies around the world. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), for example, gave this same variety the "green light" in 2005, relying solely on Monsanto's data. The EFSA reported that it "considers it unlikely that NK603 x MON810 maize will have any adverse effect on human and animal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, EFSA gave the thumbs-up to a GE variety that this latest study highlights potential danger to human health and reproduction. Clearly EFSA's GMO panel is in urgent need of reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recall GE worldwide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarising his findings, Prof. Dr. Jurgen Zentek, Professor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Vienna - the lead author of the study - said the differences between the mice was statistically significant, and that this effect could be attributed to the differences in food sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GE maize variety in question has been approved for planting and food use in several countries, including the US, Argentina, Japan, the Philippines and South Africa. In Mexico and the EU, it has been approved for food and feed use. Considering the severity of the potential threat, Greenpeace is demanding a recall of genetically-engineered food and crops from the market, worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action...for a GMO-free Europe!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/take-action"&gt;We have a golden opportunity: EU Environment Ministers will meet to decide on December 4 whether or not to strengthen the GMO risk assessment system. In light of the Austrian study we can call on politicians to speak up, defy the GMO lobby, and vote for the environment and consumer protection.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, the Japanese government continues to send a fleet of ships to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary to kill over a thousand whales. Each season, the fleet departs for the Sanctuary and more whales needlessly die.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/japanese-government-continues.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Who are the real criminals in the whaling industry?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we are focussing our efforts to save whales right where the Japanese government feels it the most. We're heading to Japan. On December 10th the world will celebrate the anniversary of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To coincide with this, we are creating a mass mobilisation of supporters willing to declare the arrests of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki an act of political censorship and declare themselves complicit in the crime of criticising whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lies and corruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 15th 2008, we used undercover investigators and the testimony of informers to expose large amounts of whale meat being smuggled off the Nisshin Maru to the private homes of crew members. Junichi and Toru intercepted one of the boxes, containing whale meat valued at up to US$3,000, and took it to the Tokyo public prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they are being prosecuted and are facing up to ten years in jail, for exposing an embezzlement scandal at the heart of the whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their arrest is a politically motivated attempt to quiet opposition to the whale hunt and has not gone unnoticed. Over the last few months, more than 250,000 of you have called on Japan's Prime Minister to drop the charges and release the activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the past week, the Japanese government has drawn criticism from the &lt;a title="critism from the United Nations Human Rights Committee" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/English/bodies/hrc/hrcs94.htm" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations Human Rights Committee&lt;/a&gt; for "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression and on the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting on December 10th, and leading up to Junichi and Toru's trial, we will need your help again.  Let's make sure this trial passes judgment on the real criminals in the whaling industry, and not Junichi and Toru, whose crime is speaking the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End the Hunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sailed to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in defence of the whales nine times. In 2006, a harpoon was fired over the heads of activists and the cable pulled one crew member into the freezing waters of the Antarctic. The whalers rammed our ships twice, hit one of our crew members with a metal pole and used high powered water cannons against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, they were 82 whales short of their quota. In 2007, the whaling season was cut short by a fire onboard the Nisshin Maru, and we provided emergency assistance to the whalers. In 2008 the whalers ran from the Esperanza for 14 consecutive days, saving the lives of around 100 whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are fighting to end whaling harder than ever. As a direct result of our work in Japan, whaling is under increasing scrutiny in the Japanese media. The diplomatic efforts of Australia and the US have made it a subject of increasing irritation for the Japanese department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Prime Minister. But the whale friendly nations need to make this issue more than an itch. They need to make it a pain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the whalers suffered a severe blow with the &lt;a title="Oriental Bluebird" href="/international/en/news/features/japanese-whaling-ship-outlawed281008/" target="_blank"&gt;outlawing of their supply ship, Oriental Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of our work in Panama, the state that previously flagged her. Japan needs the Oriental Bluebird to transport half their deadly catch home. Under international law, the ship should not go to the Southern Ocean, and no other nation should re-flag her.  If Japan has no supply ship, the number of whales they can take will be halved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we will not send a ship to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. We see the reaction of whaling interests as conforming perfectly to the way the most successful Greenpeace campaigns play out: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you. Then you win.'  We have not won yet, but whaling in Japan is now clearly moving toward the endgame -- and we are moving our campaign to the place where we believe that endgame will be played out -- in Tokyo. We can stop future whaling fleets before they even leave the port and we can end whaling in the Southern Ocean forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stand up for justice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Japanese government is going to unfairly prosecute the two activists for exposing the scandal and corruption of the whaling industry, they will have to face everyone that supports an end to the whale hunt.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;Join the fight to stop whaling -- in person and online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;Declare your solidarity with Junichi and Toru's efforts to save whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Happy 10th Birthday! Let’s ensure Kyoto continues to grow healthy and strong!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kyoto-10th-birthday-121207/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;10 years old, and still Kyoto is the most far-reaching environmental treaty ever agreed - so let’s give it three cheers and wish it many happy returns!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Slightly embarrassed, Japan’s Environment Minister Ichiro Kamashito cut a giant 1.5 metre-high cake which the Solar Generation, Greenpeace’s youth group, arranged to celebrate the 10th birthday of the Kyoto Protocol, in Bali, on 11 December. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japan's Environment Minister, Ichiro Kamoshita, cuts the cake celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol, presented at the international meeting on climate change in Bali by the Solar Generation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For the metrically-challenged, like some of us here at
Greenpeace, that's very nearly 5 feet of gateau!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No scantily-clad activist emerged from inside the cake...the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;embarrassment was due to Kyoto's host country, Japan - assisted
by Australia and Canada - doing its best during the current UN
climate negotiations to prevent its offspring Protocol from growing
up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-tier cake, decorated with forests, orangutans and
symbols of renewable energy, including wind turbines and solar
panels, carried the words 'Happy 10th Birthday Kyoto'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyoto has defied attempts by the US Administration to kill it.
Better yet, the agreement is working. That's according to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - which picked up its
Nobel Peace Prize this week, in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC's report earlier this year was clear: "The Kyoto
Protocol's most notable achievements are the stimulation of an
array of national policies, the creation of a carbon market and the
establishment of new institutional mechanisms."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Kyoto needs to be fed the healthy diet of a strong Bali
mandate for governments to commit to deep and legally-binding cuts
in greenhouse gas emissions when the Protocol is in its mid
teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's holding Kyoto back, according to the IPCC, is its "modest
emissions limits." The pre-eminent scientific body on climate
change wrote, "It would be more effective if the first commitment
period is followed-up by measures to achieve deeper reductions and
the implementation of policy instruments covering a higher share of
global emissions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not agree more. Kyoto is the most far-reaching
environmental treaty ever agreed, with almost every country in the
world committing to some form of action in the fight against
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's give three cheers to Kyoto and wish it many happy
returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one birthday cake on which the candles must be kept
burning!&lt;/p&gt;

            Don't Cook the Climate - a polar bear sends a vital message to delegates of the UN Climate Change conference in Bali, Indonesia. (C) Greenpeace/Rante 2007
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Gore goes full bore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a packed side event at the Bali climate conference,
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore, urged delegates to raise their
level of ambition, saying that, "The maximum now considered
possible is the minimum and falls far short of what we need."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tore into the United States for the blocking role the Bush
Administration is playing in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore reminded delegates, jaded by nearly two weeks of wrangling
with text, that change will come. And in a reference to how the
recent Australian election had overturned that government's stance
on the current Kyoto Protocol and with an eye to next year's US
Presidential election he said, "Over the next two years, the United
States is going to be somewhere it isn't right now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bali is now. Gore urged delegates to negotiate around the US
- the "elephant in the room" as he called it - and reminded his
audience that they have in their hands "the destiny of all
generations to come."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech laden with quotable quotes, his final reference was
to the ingredient that has so far been lacking in Bali, namely
political will. Gore says political will is a "renewable resource".
That's right: if you don't use it, you lose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Europe finally showing some grit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours before Gore spoke, France's Environment Minister
Jean-Louis Borloo threatened to withdraw from hosting a meeting of
the Major Emitters - a process for 'doing whatever takes your
fancy' on climate - which the US has set up to try and supplant
Kyoto. In a heated meeting with Paula Dobriansky, head of the US
delegation, Borloo said they could all forget a trip to Paris
unless the US came to the table with a Kyoto-style proposal with
binding commitments to cut global warming pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal, which currently occupies the revolving Presidency of
the European Union, rammed home the same message during a press
conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;‘Advance Australia Fair’? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is ratifying Kyoto. So why is it still one of the Bali
bad guys opposing real action to cut emissions? An opinion poll we
commissioned shows overwhelming support among Australians for Kevin
Rudd, the new Aussie premier, to go further in the next three years
by cutting the country's greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out
electricity generation from coal-fired power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by Newspoll, found that 86 percent of
Australians want Rudd to put in place new policies to cut
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rudd, it looks like you have a mandate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2007 is seventh warmest year &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data also released today by the UK's Hadley Centre and the
University of East Anglia shows that 2007 confirms the warming
trend, confirming the need for swift action. Globally, 2007 has
been the seventh warmest year since 1850, despite the moderating
effect of 2007's La Nina event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre's head of climate prediction said the data confirms
"the need for swift action to combat further rises in global
temperatures."&lt;/p&gt;

	Here's some good news in the fight to protect the second largest rainforest on Earth, as Olam - a major trading company - finds its World Bank funding cut, after we revealed their involvement in illegal logging in the Congo Basin Forest.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/congo-forest.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest on the banks of the Congo river system, Equatorial province, Democratic Republic of Congo.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of weeks ago, we wrote to the World Bank's private lending arm, the International Finance Corporation, highlighting its investment in Olam International, a Singapore-based global commodities trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pointed out that Olam was trading in illegally logged timber in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the International Finance Corporation has decided to sell its stake in Olam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olam's involvement in illegal timber trade was first detailed in our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/carving-up-the-congo-exec/"&gt; Carving up the Congo report&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year. The report illustrated how Olam was holding forest land in the Congo &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/when-is-a-moratorium-not-a-moratorium"&gt; granted in breach of a moratorium on the granting of new logging titles&lt;/a&gt;, which the World Bank itself had helped to establish. The report also described how Olam was sourcing timber from destructive and illegal operations through de-facto subcontracting agreements with third-party suppliers involved in illegal logging. While Olam has subsequently returned logging titles obtained in breach of the moratorium, it continues to trade in destructive and illegal timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congo Basin Forest constitutes the second largest rainforest on Earth, storing important amounts of carbon and providing livelihoods for tens of millions of people. The story of logging in the Congo forests, however, is a story of corruption, environmental havoc and social injustice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is completely out of control. Meaningful law enforcement and government control are non-existent. Social conflict is omnipresent in logging concessions where the needs of local communities clash with the rush for profit by international companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move by the International Finance Corporation should send a strong signal to all those investors and companies involved in the destruction of the Congo rainforests. It should also serve as a warning to donors, such as the German and the French governments, who are currently considering financial support for large logging companies in the DRC. The World Bank must address the serious shortcomings in its programmes in the DRC - which have been identified by its own Inspection Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As delegates in Bali negotiate the future of our global climate and our forests - the protection of which is a key solution to climate change - rainforest destruction in Africa continues unabated - but the International Finance Corporation's action points towards a window of opportunity in the DRC. The international community needs to help the country develop alternatives that benefit communities and reduce poverty, and it needs to do this now!&lt;/p&gt;

	A series of protests this morning pressured the energy company Enel to shut down its coal-fired power plant in Genoa, Italy. Enel is keeping the plant open, despite demands by the regional government to shut it down immediately.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/enel-genoa261008.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/enel-genoa261008.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists added their voice to the regional government's - calling on energy company Enel to shut down its coal-fired power plant in Genoa.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists entered the power plant, and climbers hung a banner
from Genoa's landmark "Torre della Lanterna" lighthouse. At the
same time, activists from our ship Arctic Sunrise painted "Quit
Coal" and "No Carbone" [No Coal] on the Ukrainian cargo ship
Aristea, as it offloaded coal at the port.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;About the coal plant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant, built in 1928, was due to shut down in 2002, but the
previous Italian government, under Silvio Berlusconi, granted it an
extension until 2020, directly undermining the regional
authorities. Enel insists it will keep the plant open until this
date. Enel is Italy's single biggest climate polluter, and is
responsible for nearly a third of all CO2 emissions coming from
Italian electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The Genoa plant is way past its retirement age. Keeping it open
directly contributes to the climate crisis and to local pollution,"
said Francesco Tedesco, Greenpeace Italy climate and energy
campaigner, from the scene. "The regional government has made it
clear that it wants Enel to close the plant down, and Greenpeace is
here today to make sure Enel listens."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Liguria regional government's energy plan is one of the few
in Italy to be &lt;a href="http://www.ambienteinliguria.it/eco3/DTS_GENERALE/20071002/pianoenergetico.pdf" title="The Liguria regional government plans to increase renewables capacity to 7% by 2012."&gt;
applauded&lt;/a&gt;. Greenpeace is encouraging it to push through its
renewable energy plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It is scandalous that Enel ignores the requests of the Liguria
authorities," said Agnes de Rooij, Greenpeace International climate
and energy campaigner onboard the Arctic Sunrise. "There is no
excuse for keeping this massively polluting coal-fired power plant
open, especially when clean, safe wind and solar power are able to
produce the &lt;a href="http://www.anev.org/modules/Documents/eodocuments/Potenziale_Eolico.pdf"&gt;
same amount of electricity&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Ciao Italy, Quit Coal tour continues
with the Rainbow Warrior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew of the Arctic Sunrise and Greenpeace Italy activists
have had a busy and successful ten days in Italy, challenging the
coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They kicked it off by occupying a crane at a coal plant
construction site near Rome, on October 16th.  Other activists
painted, "No Carbone" on the power plant's dock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Italian government was trying block important
climate change agreements being discussed by the European Union. 
We helped turn up the heat on them in Brussels and back home. 
After two days of talks, the Italian government lost. EU leaders
confirmed their commitment to finalise the climate and energy
package before international climate negotiations take place in
December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, activists blockaded an E.ON coal plant in Sardinia -
stopping the two conveyor belts delivering coal into the furnace.
We met with the regional environmental minister - while climbers
maintained a 14-hour occupation of the conveyor belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to the minister about how Sardinia should be investing
in renewable energy instead of pushing more coal.  He agreed and
promised the regional government would revise its energy plans to
meet EU climate protection targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this victory, we decided to show some support for a
regional government that was already trying to do the right thing.
Hopefully, today's action will get Enel to listen, and shut down
its coal plant near Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The Quit Coal expedition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is running short. Quitting coal is essential to a
meaningful deal to save the climate. European governments need to
show leadership by phasing-out coal in their own countries. Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;Energy
[R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; shows how renewable energy, combined with greater
energy efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by 50 percent and
deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's protests are part of a four-month tour by our ships
Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise. Bringing the "Quit Coal"
message to the Mediterranean and Europe. Our Quit Coal expedition
is happening in the run-up to crucial UN climate negotiations in
Poznan, Poland, this December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/getinvolved/"&gt;Things you can do to create an Energy Revolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The statement below was signed by the
heads of six international NGOs: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span name="spanarticlecontent" id="spanArticleContent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gerd Leipold, International Executive       Director, Greenpeace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Irene Khan, Secretary General, Amnesty
International &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremy Hobbs, Executive Director, Oxfam
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Dean Hirsch, Chief Executive Officer, World Vision
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tom Miller, Chief Executive Officer, PLAN
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span name="spanarticlecontent" id="spanArticleContent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Robert Glasser, Secretary General, CARE       International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Last week the USgovernment provided another
bail-out of $37.8 billion to the giant insurancecompany, AIG,
bringing the total of rescue loans to that one company in thelast
two weeks to nearly $123 billion. This is $18 billion &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;
than the annual amount of aid to poor countries and twice
thatneeded to achieve the internationally-agreed Millennium
Development Goals. In Europe the bail-outs have continued. The UK
government has thrown in a further 50billion to recapitalise the
UKbanking sector - which is roughly what's needed for poor
countries to adapt toclimate change each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urgency shown by rich countries to tackle the financial
meltdown standsin stark contrast to their foot-dragging and broken
promises over aid andpoverty alleviation, human rights and climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is too soon yet to predict exactly how badly the poorest
countries willfare in the financial crisis and resultant economic
downturn. But it is clearthat reduced demands for exports to
developed countries and lower foreigninvestment will mean less
growth and government revenue for already-fragilesocial protection
and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millions of the world's poorest citizens, it is literally a
matterof life and death. In many countries social safety nets were
dismantled underpressure from international financial institutions,
leaving the vulnerableunprotected. In late September, while Wall
Street was reeling from its financialfailures in the glare of
publicity, a meeting organized by the United Nations inanother part
of Manhattan revealed that very few governments will meet
thetargets set by the Millenium Development Goals to reduce poverty
by 2015, andthat rising food and energy prices have wiped away much
of the progress made sofar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human rights prognosis is not good. Not only are economic
and socialrights - including the right to housing, health and
education - coming underincreased pressure, there is a risk of more
human rights violations. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As the economy shrinks and countries
tightentheir belts, migrants and refugees could be pushed back to
untenablesituations. Social tensions could increase, leading
nervous governments toclamp down on dissent and impose tough public
security policies, curbing civilliberties. Already fragile states
could be further weakened by the currentcrisis and slide back into
instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse could follow if rich countries decide to use the financial
crisis asan excuse to cut aid and trade. History gives us cause for
concern. During the1972/3 recession, global aid spending fell by
15% to just $28.8 billion. In1990/3, aid donors slashed their
spending by 25% over a five-year period to $46billion, and aid did
not return to 1992 levels until 2003. Humanitarian aid -what we
spend to help people hit by natural disasters and conflict - also
fell sharplyand over a similar time as a direct result of the
1990-3 recession (only theyears of the Rwandaand Kosovo conflicts
bucked that trend). In terms of trade, for instance,
countriesreacted to the 1929 Wall Streetcrash and global depression
by erecting tariff barriers and world trade fell bytwo-thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A replay ofthat in 2009 would be a disaster for poor exporting
countries.Reduced aid and trade flows could mean that the people in
the poorestcountries pay the highest price for the profligacy of
the credit bubble inNorth America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human rights are not a luxury for good times. Inaction in the
face of climatechange is not a viable option. Global poverty does
nothing for globalstability. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rich countries will befollowing a myopic and
self-defeating strategy if they ignore the most pressingchallenges
of our times and focus solely on narrow financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just about money. It is about sustainedattention,
international collaboration and clear political will to tackle
bigissues. The signs of concerted action by the G7 finance
ministers and the Eurozonefinance ministers to address the
financial crisis are welcome but they are notenough.
Governmentsmust reduce the volatility in energy prices, food prices
and the financialmarkets by ensuring sensible regulation, adequate
protection for the rights of poorand vulnerable people, and
long-term environmental sustainability. Governmentsmust show
decisive leadership to build a global economy that is green and
wherebetter lives and livelihoods for all is more important than a
system thatrewards a privileged few.&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s said that a week is a long time in politics. The burning question is whether two weeks is long enough for governments to finally wake up, smell the carbon and confront the biggest problem facing the world. Yes, says Greenpeace. Absolutely.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real action for the climate means tackling the biggest emitters like coal fired power stations. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is plain and simple: stop bickering. Put aside your
differences. Come up with a crystal-clear mandate so negotiators
can go full-bore over the next two years to agree deep cuts in
global warming pollution. And make sure that the long-neglected
issue of ending deforestation is firmly in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Real action for the climate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, governments have let us, their citizens, down by
failing to get to grips with the problem. They've left us
increasingly exposed to the biggest threat that civilisation has
ever faced. Before things get totally out of hand, governments have
to knuckle down to business in Bali and act on the basis of the
alarming scientific findings about climate change that they
themselves approved at the IPCC meeting only a few weeks ago. They
agreed that climate change can be beaten using means already at our
disposal or just around the corner. So let's finally see some real
action for the climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without serious cuts in global warming pollution, the future
will be more frightening and insecure than we can imagine. And it's
no longer the dim and distant future we're talking about. We are
into the realm of IMTO - "In My Term of Office". One government -
in Australia - has already been thrown out partly because it
consistently stonewalled on climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now major global corporations are at long last viewing action
against climate change as a growth opportunity and calling for
legally-binding commitments. It's the secure framework they need to
put big bucks into solutions, even if many companies have still to
put their own house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks is a short time for a political turn-round. But it can
be done. Although not a single gram of carbon will be cut nor a
single sapling saved as a direct result of Bali - for these are
talks about talks - without agreement there governments may well
have lost the opportunity of ever putting the brakes on climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Over the last month there have been a catalogue of accidents at the French nuclear site Tricastin-Pierrelatte. We’ve followed all the breaking stories on our new weblog ‘Nuclear Reaction’. Now Greenpeace France has launched two court cases in an effort to find out what’s really been going on at the site.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists make an unexpected appearance during the opening ceremony of the World Energy Conference.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a heck of a nuclear month in France, here's a timeline
of what we know so far:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 7, 11PM, over 74 kilos of
uranium is leaked into the environment  from &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/only_18000_litres.html"&gt;
Tricastin&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 8, 7AM, eight hours later the
authorities are informed;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 8, 1PM,  Restrictions on
fishing, bathing and drinking local water are introduced 14 hours
after the accident;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 17, investigation of the leak
reveals that there is &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/areva_uranium_leak_update.html"&gt;
more radioactivity&lt;/a&gt; present than the leak could have caused.
Further investigation suggests that the military, who stored
radioactive material at the site underground without proper
containment in the 60's and 70's could be to blame;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 23, a leaking pipe results in
&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/slightly_contaminated.html"&gt;
100 workers&lt;/a&gt; being exposed to radioactive particles from a
leaking pipe;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 29, a false alarm results in
120 workers being evacuated, tests show that &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/tricastin_again.html"&gt;
45 employees&lt;/a&gt; have traces of radiation on them from the previous
weeks' leak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first incident the French police have launched an
investigation and the French Environment Minister has ordered tests
of the ground water at all French nuclear power facilities. That's
of little comfort to a community which has discovered that their
water could have been contaminated by radioactive waste for the
last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're suing French power company Areva and its subsidiary
company Socatri for causing water pollution, and for the
abandonment and illegal deposit of waste. Our aim is to bring into
the public eye the circumstances that led to these problems and
expose the terrible safety record of the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva is the 90 percent state owned flagship of the French
nuclear industry, and along with the French power company EDF is a
key part in President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to spread nuclear
power to the word. Since coming to power Sarkozy has concluded
deals to spread French nuclear technology everywhere from Finland
to South Africa, and from the USA to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Sarkozy is intent on selling this technology to others
while unable to manage it securely at home says it all. Our message
for the President? "Nuclear Power? Non merci."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction"&gt;Blog - Nuclear Reaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Australian government vows to back Kyoto, leaving Bush isolated</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rudd-election-australia-kyoto/</url><text>
	It was an unprecedented election campaign in Australia. Every party was forced to take a position on climate change. In the end, Labor was victorious - boosted by a pledge to sign the Kyoto Protocol and generate 20 percent of Australia's energy from renewable sources by 2020.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/11/15-november-7am-shutting-dow.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/11/15-november-7am-shutting-dow.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            To cut greenhouse gas emissions, we must close dirty coal-fired power plants like Munmorah in NSW (pictured).
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the world's only international agreement
with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. John
Howard, the outgoing Australian Prime Minister, refused to sign it.
Kevin Rudd, the new Prime Minster, made it an election issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard lost.  He was even defeated in his home district, losing
his seat in Parliament - something that's happened to a Prime
Minister only once before in Australian history - and that was in
1929.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear Aussies care about climate change, and with the issue
central to the Australian Labor Party's winning campaign, the
nation will want and expect to see real action on the issue, and
fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ratifying Kyoto is a good first step. But the key indicator of
the new government's success will be if emissions begin to decrease
during this term, and the only way that is possible is to rid
Australia of its addiction to coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next round of Kyoto negotiations is only a week away. When
the US delegation shows up in Bali, Indonesia, for the talks
they'll be isolated more than ever. Rudd's decision to sign Kyoto
leaves the US as the only major industrialized nation refusing to
commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate scientists are telling us that emissions of greenhouse
gases must peak in just seven years - 2015 - and then be reduced,"
said Shane Rattenbury, Greenpeace International political director.
"We expect that when Kevin Rudd goes to the Bali negotiations in
two weeks' time, he will take a position of leadership rather than
being the destructive force that Australia has been over the past
decade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hit 'Stop' on coal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/sites/petition/coal/?MM_URL=gpi-aussie-election"&gt;Australians:  Remind Prime Minister Rudd why you voted him in - to take action on climate change!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=gpi-aussie-election"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	The latest edition of our quarterly Guide to Greener Electronics assesses for the first time TVs and the rapidly growing games consoles market. Nintendo completely fails to show any environmental credentials and Microsoft and Philips do little better.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/toshiba-laptop-toxic-test.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/toshiba-laptop-toxic-test.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greener Electronics Guide is our way of getting the electronics industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide ranks companies&lt;/a&gt; according to their policies and practices on toxic chemicals and takeback. Along with mobile phone and personal computer companies, we've now added the biggest makers of TVs and games consoles. Old TVs are a large part of e-waste and the games console market is one of the fastest growing in consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object id="Green v.06MX" width="430" height="237" data="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2008/3/rankingguide6thedition.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-nintendo-r.pdf"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; has the dubious honour of being the first company to score 0/10 in the guide. &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-microsoft.pdf"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; did little better, scoring only 2.7. &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-philips-ra.pdf"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; is the lowest TV-maker scoring only 2. The companies are new to the Guide so have plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-sony-erics-3.pdf"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; has taken over number one spot from Nokia while Samsung and Sony have surged ahead to now occupy second and third positions. Nokia and Motorola have each had a penalty point deducted after we found their claims of global takeback were not being matched by actual practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matching words to actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested the implementation of product takeback programmes in six countries where Motorola, Nokia and Sony Ericsson claim, on their websites, to operate product takeback programmes. Nokia representatives in the Philippines, Thailand, Argentina, Russia and India were not informed about their companies' own programmes and in many cases provided misleading information. Motorola staff in the Philippines, Thailand and India were unable to direct customers to collection points in their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one example from our investigations when we visited a Nokia centre recommended by Nokia for recycling phones in Argentina with a hidden camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="425" height="355" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/qjt0-NrlqoQ&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qjt0-NrlqoQ&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Nokia falls from top position to ninth and Motorola drops from ninth position to fourteenth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies shouldn't be under any illusions that we won't check up on their claims of green greatness," commented Iza Kruszewska, toxics campaigner at Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies making the most progress with new products without the worst toxic chemicals are now ranking higher than companies who have only committed to remove them in the future. Toshiba has laptops free of toxic chemicals like &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#pvc"&gt; vinyl plastic (PVC)&lt;/a&gt; and has reduced the use of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#bfr"&gt; brominated flame retardants&lt;/a&gt; (BFRs). Apple's score improves slightly due to new iMacs reducing the use of PVC and BFRs. All new mobiles from Sony Ericsson and Nokia have been free of PVC since the end of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide focuses on toxic chemicals and takeback policy because of the rapid growth in quantities of toxic e-waste being dumped in developing countries like China and India. While Nintendo's Wii console appears to be more energy efficient compared to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation, energy use is not yet covered in the ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies have made big strides to improve their products and recycling schemes since the introduction of the Guide. But no company has so far succeeded in offering a entire range of products free of the worst toxic chemicals or a comprehensive, free, global takeback scheme to ensure responsible recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=6thRanking"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite. Not accepting corporate donations means we rely entirely on people like you to help keep us going. Some of our corporate targets spend in a few hours what we spend in an entire year. Please help with anything you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A flotilla of fishing boats greet the Greenpeace SV Rainbow Warrior flagship as she sails into Bali Indonesia today 7 December 2007. The flotilla is calling on people all over the world to take part in tomorrow's global day of action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 19 countries joined or led a variety of
protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that
Ministers who arrive in Bali, Indonesia for the final week of
negotiations agree on a strong plan to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'"There is only one week to go to agree on a mandate to
negotiate a stronger Kyoto Protocol, with deep emissions reductions
for developed countries, plus an agreement to tackle
deforestation," said Gavin Edwards, head of the climate campaign,
from Bali. "A loud and clear message from capital cities around the
world will be pivotal in keeping the pressure up on governments to
not leave Bali empty-handed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates from protests around the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia, Thailand joined the Global Day of
Climate Action by releasing the new edition of "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-thailand/news/global-climate-action-save-climate-handbook"&gt;
Save the Climate Handbook&lt;/a&gt;" with a forward from Dr. Sumet
Tantivechakul, Thailand's renowned scientist about how sustainable
economy can reduce global warming at Chatuchak weekend market, one
of the world's biggest weekend markets. The activity also had a
solar bar and Climate Clinic demonstrating the use of solar energy
and where people could calculate their carbon dioxide emissions.
There was also a music performance by Ionian band. Moreover, people
could write their messages to be delivered to the UN Climate Change
Conference in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Be The Change coalition, we held a 'Climate
Rescue Carnival'.  there was food, drinks, music, info,
face-painting, and a biodiesel powered bouncy-castle for the kids.
Over 500 people formed a human banner spelling out 'Climate SOS'.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace activists ended their occupation of a
thermal coal power plant. One of the climbers said, "This plant is
a symbol of how coal not only threatens the world's climate but
devastates the land and people's lives." (&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2007/12/video_activists_occupy_czech_c.html"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overa thousand Greenpeace India volunteers used placards to
spell outmessages in the stands at the first day of the
India-Pakistan cricketmatch (watched by millions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They made their messages matchevents on the field. For example,
every time a batsman hit a four, theyshowed a message saying,
'climate change knows no boundaries.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ivolunteered for this activity with Greenpeace because it's my
world tosave. I don't need to be a super hero and teaming up with
others I willdo what I can to collectively make a difference." said
Shams, a studentfrom 2nd year PU St. Joseph's College who held a
letter placard withthe message 'Climate Change is World
Emergency'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace together with Finnish League for Nature Conservation
skied across the centre of Helsinki, calling for and end to
emissions to bring back the snow for the skiers. The fair lady of
Finland was hanging far behind the rest of the skiers, referring to
Finland being left behind in international climate commitments. The
happening was a part of international climate action day on 8th
December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the centre of Luxembourg City, our activists
installed a 9 x 6 meter flag "Change" (the logo of Greenpeace
Luxembourg's green power campaign) above the flag of the "blue
deer". The "blue deer" is the symbol of Luxembourg, the European
capital of culture 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the culture year ends today, the age of energy revolution
starts. The Greenpeace flag will remain on top of the flagpole
until Sunday, so thousands of people coming to Luxembourg City to
celebrate the closing party activities of the culture year will see
our message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace Russia activists hang a banner over the
Moskva River with the Kremlin as a backdrop. Russia ranks third in
the world in terms of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Mexico participated with a trajinera, a typical
Mexican boat, going to Kyoto Plus and asking for the climate to be
saved.  The message of the banner says: 2° = GLOBAL DANGER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HK power plant, announced its own climate change policy on Dec
7. So we did an action before their announcement. We suspended a
banner writing "Climate Change Starts Here" at the 30-m tall ash
silos outside the plant. The aim is to push the Hong Kong
government to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants and shoulder
the responsibility of combating climate change as an international
city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a thousand people joined the demonstration. Bad weather but
good spirits. Some people were dressed up as animals: a polar bear
and a homeless orangutan sitting at a bus stop. We had a rickshaw
where people could hop in, go online and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-sweden/palmolja-otankbart/namninsamling"&gt;
create their own monkey&lt;/a&gt; to our virtual monkey mountain  - in
order to help get rid the Swedish subsidies for palm oil as a
biofuel.&lt;/p&gt;

this around 4000 people turned up for to call for ambitious targets
to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands protested across the country, including at one of
Europe's largest coal plants (near Düsseldorf).  Millions of people
also turned their lights off for five minutes at 8:00 pm - saving
roughly 1,000 megawatts of electricity, which means about 25
million lightbulbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/send-a-message-to-bali?MM_URL=gda-climate-07"&gt;Send a message - Tell world leaders "Climate Action Now!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=gda-climate-07"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Habbo survey - 'Generation C'</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/habbo-survey/</url><text>
	According to conventional wisdom (oh all right the tabloid press to be more precise) all teenagers ever think about are themselves. So it may come as a surprise that a global survey of almost 50,000 teens released today reveals that they have many other concerns - and that they worry more about dangerous greenhouse gases than drugs, violence or war.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/12/habbo.gif" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Habbo against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As governments meet in Bali to thrash out a coordinated response
to the challenge of climate change, 74 per cent of those polled
through the online Habbo community see it as a serious problem. In
fact, 56 per cent see it as the greatest threat facing the world
today, even greater than terrorism (46 per cent). And they think
that governments which are more concerned about terrorism than
climate change have got things the wrong way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of those polled believe climate change will have a
negative effect on their lives. And who do they think is
responsible? North America comes in for the strongest criticism,
with 39 per cent of teens citing the continent as the source of the
majority of greenhouse gases, followed by Europe (24 per cent) and
Asia (19 per cent). Despite teens in every country pointing fingers
at North America for the crisis (except in Asia where they blame
themselves), a quarter of North American teens are still not sure
if global warming is even a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the up side, 64 per cent believe that we can control global
warming, provided that we act now. Many are planning to promote &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action/"&gt;
Saturday's climate day of action&lt;/a&gt; by holding events and
demonstrations within their virual communities. They see themselves
as 'Generation C' - the generation who will have to bear the brunt
of dealing with climate change over the coming decades. And their
message to the Bali negotiators is clear - there is no more
important challenge facing mankind than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that this message, together with the many others
flooding in to Bali from around the world, will get through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;About the survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted within the virtual world, Habbo, and
the total amount of respondents (after data cleaning) was 49,243.
The research was conducted in November 2007. 18 countries were
surveyed and statistical weighting was employed to give all
participating countries an equal weight in the global results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;About Habbo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habbo is a richly colorful, multi-dimensional virtual community
and game environment for teens. Users join by creating a
fully-customized online character called a Habbo. From there, they
can explore many public hang-outs, play a variety of games, connect
with friends, decorate their own rooms, and have fun through
creativity and self expression. Currently there are Habbo
communities in 31 countries on five continents. To date, over 82
million Habbo characters have been created and 6 million unique
users worldwide visit Habbo each month (source: Google
Analytics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your Habbo group&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2007/12/kids_in_virtual_world_call_out.html#more?MM_URL=habbo"&gt;Habbo is a virtual community for teens. There are already 16 Habbos against climate change groups.

	The forests of Argentina are being cleared at a rate of 40 football fields every hour. To stop the destruction we took to the trees - and to the streets. While our activists protested in the forest, we joined forces with other environmental groups, got 1.5 million signatures of support and pushed through Argentina's first federal forest protection law.

            Demonstration at the National Congress to demand the Forest Law.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law includes a nationwide one-year moratorium on
clearing of native forests - to avoid a rush of deforestation while
forest management regulations are put in place. After a year, any
jurisdiction still lacking regulations will continue to be
prohibited from issuing new logging and land clearing permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Law also establishes environmental impact studies and
public hearings - measures that will help protect forests where
indigenous people live and small scale farmers.  To pay for
implementation, the law allocates funds from the national budget,
plus income from a new export tax on genetically engineered
soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest clearing to plant genetically engineered soy beans
destroys 300,000 hectares of native forest per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Without those 1,500,000 signatures and the thousands of phone
calls which the senators received, this law would never have been
approved," said Hernan Giardini, Forest Campaign Coordinator for
Greenpeace Argentina. "It is a real victory for the people and for
the entire country."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we are only waiting for the approval of Congress, which we
believe will happen before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  On 28 November 2007, the bill was approved and became law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=arg-forest-victory"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Wind turbine crop circle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Act is a scientifically based solution that would by 2050;
reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent compared to
1990 levels. This is urgently needed to stop climate change
spiralling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reductions may seem like a big ask, but luckily we have the
solution - investment in renewable energy technologies, and massive
improvements in the ways we use energy, make the goals entirely
plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Crop circle boosts campaign &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign had a great boost this week, when Congressman Dave
Loebsack in Iowa changed his mind and agreed to sign up to the Act.
He had previously told Greenpeace that though he was concerned
about global warming, he would be unable to commit to the Safe
Climate Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Greenpeace and local grassroots groups created a very clear
message, a crop circle of a wind turbine in an Iowan cornfield. The
demand was simple "Congress: deliver renewable energy solutions to
climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked, Loebsack signed the very next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on Iowa to have at least 20 per cent of
its energy come from renewable technologies by 2020. This alone
would create 5,080 jobs, one and half times more than generating
electricity from fossil fuels does. Consumers would save a massive
$400 million (US) in lower electricity and natural gas bills, and
the greenhouse gas emission reductions would equal a massive 71
million cars off the road.  &lt;span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'&gt;Hopefully, Loebsack colleague, Representative LeonardBoswell, will soon follow suit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kelly Mitchell from Greenpeace USA put it "the solutions to
global warming are right here in the fields of Iowa."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dutch court rules that term "clean coal" is misleading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Greenpeace Netherlands had a court victory this week,
when the Dutch Advertising Authority (ACA) ruled that use of terms
such as "clean coal" and "clean fuel" by Dutch energy giant NUON
are "misleading."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NUON must now stop using "clean coal" in its print and web
adverts. The ruling shows that "clean coal" is a contradiction in
terms and that aggressive marketing of it is nothing more than a
desperate attempt by the coal industry to make itself relevant in
the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join project hot seat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/action/start.php?action_id=145"&gt;Help get the Safe Climate Act passed by the US Congress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=hot-seat"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	The Japanese whaling fleet has delayed its departure to the Southern Ocean for its annual whale hunt to avoid political embarrassment when Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda meets with US President George W. Bush.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hold a banner with an question mark  beside the Nisshin Maru 'Research' factory ship,  demonstrating the fake nature of the whaling operation. Greenpeace is using every peaceful available means to bring the hunt to an early end and make it the last time the Sanctuary is breached by the whalers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's annual Southern Ocean whale hunt is conducted under the
guise of science but has been condemned internationally. This
season, Japan aims to kill more than 1,000 whales, including 50
endangered fin whales and, for the first time in 20 years, 50
threatened humpback whales will also be harpooned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Whaling Commission has called for an end to
the killing of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary under
Japan's whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship the Esperanza is currently positioned just outside
Japanese territorial waters and will be following the Japanese
whaling fleet after it leaves the port of Shimonseki for its
passage towards the Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese government's 'scientific' whaling programme is a
sham and a source of diplomatic tension between Japan and countries
that support whale conservation, like the United States. Whaling
has no place in Antarctica - it's a place of peace and science, and
this is not science," said Karli Thomas, expedition leader aboard
the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll carried out in Japan by the Nippon Research
Centre, in June 2006, showed that 95 per cent of Japanese people
never or rarely eat whale meat. More than two-thirds of Japanese do
not support whaling on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/16/2093101.htm"&gt;Another
study&lt;/a&gt; recently conducted by Julia Bowett, a PhD student from
the University of Tasmania, found that among Japanese students
approximately 65 percent agreed with the view that scientific
research on whales should only use non-lethal methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that you don't need to kill whales for research,
Greenpeace is collaborating with a team of scientists on the '&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt;' project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from satellite tagging of whales, harmless skin biopsies
and fluke identification has already yielded valuable information
about the migration patterns of threatened humpback populations,
without a single harpoon being fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/map/"&gt;
display the location&lt;/a&gt; of the whaling fleet as it is tracked
south by the Esperanza on the same map on which it is tracking
humpback migration routes from their breeding grounds in New
Caledonia and the Cook Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan's whalers are deceiving the Japanese public by painting
the word 'research' on their ships," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace
Japan Whales Project leader. "Real scientists don't need to kill
whales to study them. This is commercial whaling poorly dressed up
as science."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese Government should already know that information
about whales can be gained without killing them. The Antarctic
whale hunt is an expensive waste of Japanese taxpayers' money and
goes against public opinion in Japan and overseas. The time has
come for the Japanese government to end this hunt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has close to 4,000 tons of whale meat from its
'scientific' whaling programme in cold storage - uneaten, unsold,
and unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/great-whale-trail/profiles/whalemail?MM_URL=whalefleethiding"&gt;Get your Free Whale Mail delivered straight to your inbox with all the latest news about our how you can help defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org/visitor/index.php?event_id=main"&gt;You can create your own fundraising page to help end whaling in the Southern Ocean forever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

effort: a polluter's summit he called for representatives of the
European Union, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom,
Japan,Canada, India, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Russia,
Australia,Indonesia and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the goal of this meeting? To persuade other countries

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Join Kyoto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If George Bush was serious about solving global warming,  he
wouldjoin with 175 other countries, and sign the Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries meeting in Washington accountfor over 90% of
emissions worldwide. Real action by those gathered inWashington
could deliver massive cuts in emissions under the KyotoProtocol.
But this would require binding, mandatory targets forindustrialized
countries, which the US rejects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheBig Emitters meeting is a distraction from the valuable
andconstructive work within the United Nations leading up to the
climatetalks in Bali, Indonesia. What the world needs is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/un-climate-summit/"&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The second biggest nuclear disaster in history</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mayak-nuclear-disaster280907/</url><text>
	Everybody knows that the biggest nuclear catastrophe in history was Chernobyl. But how many have heard of the second biggest? Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of a radiation nightmare.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mayaknuclearvictim2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ramzis has hydrocephalus. “I don’t like to go to school, because the boys call me bad names. The girls avoid me and don’t want to go out with me. I hope I will not have children who look like me.” Ramzis lives near Mayak, the site of a former Russian nuclear plant and the most radioactively polluted place on Earth.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayak nuclear plant in the Southern Urals was one of the dark secrets of the cold war. It was the Soviet Union's primary nuclear complex, a massive set of plutonium production reactors, fuel production facilities, and reprocessing and waste storage buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957 a storage tank with highly radioactive liquid waste exploded. More than half the amount of radioactive waste released by the accident in Chernobyl was blasted into the atmosphere. A few villagers were evacuated, but most were not. 217 towns and at least 272,000 people were exposed to chronic levels of radiation. The plume was 50 kilometers wide and 1,000 kilometers long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the explosion wasn't the only incident of contamination. Between 1948 and 1956 radioactive waste was poured straight into the Techa River, the source of drinking water for many villages. It exposed 124,000 people to medium and high levels of radiation. Nuclear waste was also dumped into the lakes of West Siberia, where storms blew nuclear dust across a vast area around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The largest nuclear complex in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, around 7,000 people still live in direct contact with the highly polluted Techa river or on contaminated land. In the town of Muslyumovo, studies have show genetic abnormalities to be 25 times more frequent than in other areas of Russia. The incidents of malignant cancer are significantly higher. And the number of residents of Muslyumovo on the Russian national oncology registers is nearly 4 times higher than in the rest of Russia. In other surrounding towns and villages people have cancer rates more than double the Russian average. (See the Greenpeace Report, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/mayak-a-50-year-tragedy/"&gt; Mayak: A 50-Year Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a century later, Mayak is one of the most radioactive places on Earth, and the accident continues to have a devastating legacy. Many thousands of people have never been evacuated from contaminated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch photo-journalist, Robert Knoth, visited the Mayak region in 2000 and 2001 and took a series of &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/mayak/testimonies/image-gallery.html"&gt; highly disturbing pictures of the victims&lt;/a&gt; of radiation in the region. &lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;(Parental warning: The link above contains images of malformed foetuses and other disturbing photos.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25285/nine-year-old-kostya-victim-o.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, the real tragedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, no government could oversee this kind of disaster and not decide to change its ways. Yet, rather than learning the lessons of the tragedy, the Russian Government has passed legislation to import spent nuclear fuel from other countries to Mayak that would then permanently stay at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the countries shipping their dirty nuclear waste to Russia would allow Mayak to continue operating on their own land. Countries considering sending their radioactive waste to Russia are abdicating responsibility for their nuclear activities by dumping it somewhere else. They may like to think that once it's out of their sight they've got rid of the problem, but nothing could be further from the truth. The people who will suffer its devastating effects are right here, the same victims that have suffered the effects of the radiation disaster for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign fuel processed in Mayak so far has led to some three million cubic metres of radioactive liquid being dumped and released into the environment. Mayak has reprocessed over 1,540 tons of spent nuclear fuel from several countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities now hope to negotiate future reprocessing contracts with Switzerland, Spain, South Korea, Slovenia, Italy, Belgium, and Slovakia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 50 year contamination legacy, Mayak is a horrific example of the true face of the global nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of Mayak is that nuclear energy is not a solution. This anniversary should serve as a wake-up call to the world about the real costs of nuclear power. Nuclear power &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/nuclear_fallacy/"&gt; undermines&lt;/a&gt; the solutions to climate change, by diverting resources away from the massive investment in renewable technologies and energy efficiency the world urgently needs to tackle the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;

	Ban Ki-Moon knows a thing or two about climate change and, as head of the UN, the world’s top diplomat knows a thing or two about politics.  When our own executive director, Dr. Gerd Leipold, got in the lift at the UN bound for the 38th floor, he came to ask Ban for strong leadership at the UN climate change meeting on Monday (24th).
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon meets with Greenpeace.  From left to right: Daniel Mittler, Athena Ronquillo, Gerd Leipold, Ban Ki-moon, Jamie Choi and John Passacantando.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Secretary General has real moral authority. We hope that
Ban Ki-moon will use it to call for a "Bali Mandate". What's that?
It's what we need to get out of the biggest climate negotiations in
over a decade that will take place in Bali, Indonesia at the end of
the year. It's a rescue plan for planet earth, which will result in
a strengthened Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ban and Leipold discussed climate change -  both agreeing about
the urgency of the situation and moral imperative of taking
concrete action based upon equity to protect people and the planet
from runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Secretary General laid it out for us: "We need you,
Greenpeace, to mobilize public opinion and enable politicians to do
the right thing." Putting the ball squarely in our court and that
of our supporters. Strong leadership is only half of the equation;
public pressure is the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Greenpeace delegation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Greenpeace staff joined in the meeting.  To show our
diversity, and to deliver their own messages:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;John Passacantando&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, ably represented those
in the US that do not endorse the position and intransigence of the
Bush administration. Passacantando told how people in the US are
already addressing the climate emergency.  He also urged the
Secretary General to ignore Bush's "big emitters" conference next
week, dismissing it as a diversion tactic from a president no one
is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jamie Choi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, a young Korean activist working for Greenpeace China,
described how the energy revolution is already underway in Asia. 
Adding that many young people have grown impatient with slow moving
governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Athena Ronquillo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Mittler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, two of our policy experts, who've been first hand participants
through years of climate change political meetings, were also
there.  Ronquillo gave a quick outline of what we'll be doing in
the next few months to ramp up the pressure on politicians on the
Road to Bali and how we will push for a meaningful mandate to
tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Two climate meetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meeting with the General Secretary is a prelude to the UN
'informal' Climate Summit on Monday, September 24th, in New York,
with some 80 heads of state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this meeting next week, we are again among the speakers
addressing delegates and heads of state. Greenpeace China campaign
director Sze Ping will talk about our work there, and how China can
be part of the solution to climate change.  And he will deliver the
message of our energy revolution: We have to technology we need. We
just need to use energy smarter and ensure a massive uptake of
renewable energies and we can still avert climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later next week, the Bush administration will host its own
climate change meeting, scheduled to start September 27th in
Washington, DC.  This is the so-called "big emitters" meeting since
it's for the 16 countries that account for 90 percent of global
warming emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush is expected to keep pushing the idea of "aspirational
targets".  They are nothing legally binding or meaningful. At best,
they are a random wish list - that will still result in a cooked
planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be at the meeting too, providing analysis,
comment and opposition to this distraction from the real task.  We
need real commitment at the next climate talks. Not more fluff.
"The clock is ticking", Ban Ki-moon told us yesterday. There truly
is no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not have an invitation to the UN, but you've got an
invitation from us.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=Ban-meet"&gt;Join the 7
steps programme.&lt;/a&gt;  We'll send you seven emails over seven weeks
with simple ways you can put the heat on politicians and business
leaders. We need your help over the next few months to increase
political pressure on the road to Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

	The good news: The biggest environmental gathering of government leaders in many years showed the world is finally waking up to the urgency of climate change.  The bad news: Time is running out.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, world leaders gathered in New York City for the
largest United Nations meeting on climate change since the Rio
Earth Summit in 1992.  Top officials from 150 countries (including
80 heads of state) plus big names like Al Gore and Arnold
Schwarzenegger were in attendance - and so were we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The time for doubt has passed," as UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon said in his opening address.  Ban sees the world's response
to global warming as something that, "will define us, our era, and
ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore told the world leaders, "We have to overcome the paralysis
that has prevented us from acting".  Governor Schwarzenegger called
for, "action, action, action".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one, heads of state stood up and essentially echoed their
sentiments.  Our own Lo Sze Ping, from Greenpeace China, told the
attendees that the world's worst per capita emitting countries need
to stop using developing countries as an excuse not to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo went on to call for an energy revolution with massive uptake
in energy saving and renewable energy technology world wide, and
real action by world leaders rather than more talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the climate negotiations in December, you must therefore
agree to nothing short of a Bali Mandate," he said. "Not a road map
to nowhere, not a wish list."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bali Mandate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting on climate change negotiations under the Kyoto
Protocol will take place on the island of Bali in December.
Greenpeace is pushing for world leaders to strengthen the Kyoto
Protocol at these meetings. Industrialized countries must begin the
process of negotiating emissions reductions of 30 percent by 2020,
and at least 80 percent by 2050 in order to prevent climate chaos. 
This is what the best and latest science tells us is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings in Bali must advance a negotiating agenda, a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;
Bali Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, to combat climate change on all fronts, including
adaptation, mitigation, clean technologies, deforestation and
resource mobilization. All countries must do what they can to reach
agreement by 2009, and to have it in force at the end of the
current Kyoto Protocol commitment period at the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;US remains isolated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President George W. Bush was not among the heads of state at
the high level UN climate change meeting.  He only showed up late
at the end of the day to dine with a select group.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Bush has scheduled his own &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/guide-to-major-climate-meetings/"&gt;
meeting&lt;/a&gt; for this Thursday and Friday in Washington, DC, limited
to the countries with the largest global warming emissions.  Bush's
meeting, imaginatively dubbed the "Major Emitters Meeting", is
widely seen as part of his strategy to avoid legally binding caps
on greenhouse gas emissions.  Instead, Bush is pushing for
voluntary, "aspirational" targets with no weight behind them. Bush
is just pretending to care. The world must not be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ban_ki-moon_leipold070920/"&gt;
our meeting with Ban&lt;/a&gt;, last Wednesday, Greenpeace USA executive
director, John Passacantando, reassured the UN Secretary General
that people in the US are ready to tackle climate change, and
dismissed the Big Emitters Meeting as a diversion tactic from a
president no one is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=UN-climate-meet07"&gt;Take the future into your own hands.

	All drinks at the Olympics are on us, kind of. Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola today announced a commitment to use coolers and vending machines free of HFC gases in all official venues of the 2008 Olympic Games, demonstrating climate-friendly technology developed by Greenpeace. Getting to here has been an amazing journey over 20 years involving the most unlikely characters and situations -- even George W. Bush makes a last-minute appearance.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;CFCs to HFCs: frying pan to fire&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced
thebanning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration
industryswitched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). HFC's don't destroy
the ozonelike CFC's can. But they do cause global warming. Indeed,
some HFCgases are up to 11,000 times more harmful to the climate
than carbondioxide (CO2), your garden variety greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Solution: Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch from CFC's to HFC's
andshow how it should bedone, Greenpeace launched the concept of
Greenfreeze in 1992. We mettwoscientists who pointed out how to
avoid HFC's altogether. We found anold fridge factory, appealed to
our supporters to pre-order enoughunits to finance a refit, helped
build the market and Greenfreeze wasborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
andfuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never workand the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in theindustry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that was then, and this is now. Today there are over
100million Greenfreeze refrigerators in theworld, produced by all
the major European, Chinese, Japanese and Indianmanufacturers. It
is now available in most major markets with theexception of North
America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in
thedomestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued touse refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to theSydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such asUnilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors, to
live up to theguidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ More on the &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/"&gt;history of
Greenfreeze&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coke in the spotlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after a concerted online
campaign(CokeSpotlight.org)before the 2000 Olympics to buy green
refrigeration for new units.Before the start of the games all three
companies we had targeted&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/top-companies-ditch-climate-wr/"&gt;
announced phase outplans&lt;/a&gt; for damaging refrigeration
technologies by the time of the 2004Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Coke plans to install no less than6,350climate-friendly
coolers and vending machines in the Olymic Gamesvenues in Beijing
and six co-host cities throughout China. Calculatedbased on an
expected ten year life span of the units, they reducegreenhouse gas
emissions by approximately 4,500 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isthe first time that 100 percent of the coolers and
vending machinesprovided by Coca-Cola to all Olympics venues will
feature HFC-freeinsulation, and HFC-free natural refrigerant. For
good measure, Cokehas also added a proprietary technology called
Energy Management System(EMS) that improves energy efficiency by
more than 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thisinnovative approach of combining natural refrigerants and
energyefficient technology is a great example of how a business can
workwith other stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We
hopeCoca-Cola's efforts can accelerate industry-wide actions to
combatclimate change," said LO Sze Ping, Campaign and
CommunicationsDirector of Greenpeace China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's next for HFC's  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by Coca-Cola, the&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL1475766720070914"&gt;
Whitehouseis rumouredto beplanning an announcement&lt;/a&gt; at next
week's UN meeting on ozone depletingsubstances (the Montreal
Protocol), proposing aggressive targets tophase-out HFC gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, HFC's are expected tocontribute up to 5.2
percent of the world's global warming emissions by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take much more than publicpronouncements to tackle the
climate crisis. But as the Montreal Protocol comes to it's 20th
anniversary, and the story ofGreenfreeze demonstrates, creativity,
vigilance and a "can do!"attitude can transform even the most
familiar/dire characters andsituations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Coke-Olympics"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Island contaminated by illegal GMO</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/island-contaminated-050907/</url><text>
	Environmental activists today placed an entire island under strict quarantine after finding illegal genetically modified (GMO) soya being grown there. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists put Braila island, on the Danube river, under quarantine, after Greenpeace field investigations revealed that illegal Genetically Modified (GMO) Soya, is being grown and harvested there.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bralia Island in Romania is normally a quiet farming area on the
Danube river but now it is the site of a huge environmental
contamination by soya that has been genetically modified by the
agricultural-chemical company, Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful action in Romania began early in the morning when
30 Greenpeace activists from across Europe set up a
'decontamination station' at the ferry harbour area on Braila
Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All vehicles leaving the island were decontaminated by being
thoroughly washed to prevent the genetic contamination from
spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for member states of the European Union (EU) which
includes Romania, to cultivate GMO Soya. Greenpeace is calling on
the Romanian government and the European Commission to act
immediately to locate and destroy all of the illegally cultivated
GMO Soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have taken action to protect the rest of Romania from
contamination by these illegal GMO crops, which pose massive risks
to the environment, biodiversity and human heath. Romanian people
have overwhelmingly rejected GMO," said Gabriel Paun, Greenpeace
Romania, GMO campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not the first time Greenpeace has discovered illegal
GMO production in Romania, the situation is out of control. The
Government must immediately locate and destroy all of the crops
before they enter the food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as activists were decontaminating Bralia Island
in Romania, more activists were busy taking action against another
site of GMO contamination in France. 20 volunteers painted a field
of illegally grown GMO maize (corn) bright red, in order to expose
its location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMO maize, known as MON810, is another genetically modified
product being pushed onto consumers by Monsanto. The GMO maize is
being illegally grown, as either the farmer, or the French
government have failed to inform the public of its presence as
required under French law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By failing to take control, the Romanian and French governments
are allowing biotech companies such as Monsanto, to run riot over
their environment and ignore the wishes of European people;
contaminating their food and their fields" said Myrto Pispini,
Greenpeace International GMO campaigner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Get your free e-zine to keep up to date on how you can protect the environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Help keep our food GMO free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

for Albay to be a coal-free zone. He said: "We believe there is no
place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly
there is no place for coal in Albay." He called on all developed
countries to reject coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later the Warrior and crew were outside Pagbilao
coal-fired power plant, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/philippines-coal-blockade-230508/"&gt;
blockading shipments of coal&lt;/a&gt;. That unleashed a media frenzy,
with the front pages of the biggest papers in the Philippines
relaying our message that the country needs to quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped the protest when Senator Zubiri announced in a
communiqué to the Rainbow Warrior:  "I will file a resolution in
the Senate seeking a halt in the construction of new coal fired
power plants in the country.  In tandem will be a strong Renewable
Energy Bill that shall allow us to shift towards a low carbon
economy, and away from dependence on fossil fuels, particularly
coal. Coal carries huge environmental, health and social
costs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great start. But then today, we received another statement of
support when Senator Pia Juliana Cayetano, who chairs the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources and is the principal sponsor of the
proposed renewable energy act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cayetano declared: "I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a
coal-free Philippines. The threat of climate change demands a shift
towards a sustainable, clean and low carbon future. Government
should lay out concrete plans for implementing clean energy
solutions in the power sector."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours later the call was echoed by Congressman Lorenzo R.
Tañada III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels and the largest
single source of CO2 in the world. Currently, one-third of all
carbon dioxide emissions come from burning coal. In the Philippines
eight coal-fired power stations produce 36% of the country's energy
emissions, and the government plans to build or expand nine power
plants. Instead the Philippines need to improve the efficiency of
its energy system, embrace renewable energy and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These political developments and statements of support for our
call to Quit Coal show the impact our campaign is having. The Albay
declaration spelled out an agenda, and the peaceful confrontation
at Pagbilao has started a process that could lead to the
Philippines quitting coal for good. We'll be keeping up the
pressure in the coming days and weeks - working to deliver the
energy [r]evolution that the world needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quit Coal tour is just part of our global campaign against
coal. In recent months we've blocked coal exports in New Zealand
and power plant construction in Holland and Germany. Last week, as
our activists in the Philippines were preparing for action, a team
in Israel were delivering the message to their government. We've
also brought out a comprehensive report showing that the industries
talk of carbon sequestration is just an 'end of pipe' dream used to
justify building more coal power plants that will never be
clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;We're sending a message to the world leaders who will be meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia, and the UK join YOU by becoming energy [r]evolutionaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our planet's oceans are in deep, deep, peril, says a new report from the Worldwatch Institute.  The only road to recovery may be to declare 40 percent of the world's oceans off-limits to human exploitation to ensure the restoration of life in depleted areas.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth's surface is 70 percent covered by ocean, and
three-quarters of humanity live in coastal areas. We are hugely
dependent on marine resources - yet our oceans are facing threats
that include overfishing, toxic pollution, climate change and
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 160%; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;
Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5352?utm_campaign=oceans_in_peril&amp;amp;utm_medium=link_exchange&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace.org" target="_blank"&gt;new report from the prestigious Worldwatch
Institute, Oceans in Peril: Protecting Marine Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;,
calls for these marine reserves - areas where all extractive and
destructive activities, including fishing are prohibited - while
giving an alarming snapshot of the shocking state of the world's
oceans. It's a wake-up call that should jolt the complacency of
policy makers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written for the Worldwatch Institute by a team of experts - this
time from the Greenpeace Science Unit in the UK's Exeter University
- Oceans in Peril updates an earlier study by the same team in
1998. They have been staggered by the scale and rate of destruction
that has taken place in less than a decade in every ocean on
Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science Unit provides crucial scientific expertise to our
campaigns, and has a long history of working on oceans issues,
including whaling, toxic pollution, climate change and
overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recent studies such as the one which shows how 90 percent of
the world's large predatory fish, which include the sharks,
swordfish and tuna, have disappeared due to overfishing since the
1950s have helped expose what has been happening under the waves
and have therefore been out of sight and out of mind to most
people", says Paul Johnston, Greenpeace's chief scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril details new and emerging threats, such the
increasing acidification of the world's oceans, and underscores how
the race for ever-diminishing resources is forcing marine
ecosystems to the point of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report illustrates how 76 percent of the world's fish stocks
are fully or overexploited, an estimate borne out by figures from
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which
suggest that 158 million tons of fish were harvested worldwide in
2005 - a seven-fold increase since 1950.  Catch records between
1950 and 2000 show the "collapse" of 366 out 1,519 fisheries
worldwide, most famously the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/no-cod-blame-the-seals/"&gt;
Grand Banks cod fishery&lt;/a&gt; off Newfoundland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25292/a-good-catch-of-orange-roughy.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;©Greenpeace/Grace Orange Roughy and
bycatch in the Tasman Sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril also details the pitfalls of fish farming, the
supposed magic bullet of marine resources with alarming statistics:
producing carnivorous animals such as salmon or marine shrimp
requires 2.5 as much fishmeal as the amount of saleable fish
eventually produced. For tuna caught in the wild and fattened in
"ranches", the weight of fish fed to the tuna is a shocking 20
times more than what is actually produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage to thousands of marine animals and entire ecosystems
by the likes of longlining and bottom trawling, as well as
overfishing off the coast of developing countries, is exacerbated
the estimated 20 percent of the global catch that is illegal,
unregulated or unreported, and worth somewhere between US$4-9
billion a year. While countries with enough resources to control
their own waters stand some chance of putting measures in place to
protect resources, there's little or no regulation of any kind of
marine harvesting in international waters - an issue that needs to
be urgently addressed at an international level.&lt;/p&gt;

the sea bottom by a fish net. (Image ©Ministry of Fisheries NZ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not all doom and gloom - there is a beam of sunshine in
the report, including a comprehensive package of measures that if
implemented could reverse current trends, restoring the former
productivity of our planet's oceans. That solution is the
establishment of comprehensive marine reserves all over the world, 
protecting vulnerable species and habitats, enhancing fisheries
beyond the reserve boundaries, and buffering the worst impacts of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine reserves are the single most powerful tool available for
arresting and reversing the decline of our oceans and are equally
applicable to the high seas as they are to coastal waters. The
oceans have immense powers of regeneration and wherever in the
world marine reserves have been established marine life is
flourishing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jaguars are tree climbers, but there is no federal law to protecting their forest - so our activists have taken to the trees themselves.  Dressed as jaguars, they're camped in the treetops of the Yungas in a bid to block the bulldozers until a federal law can be passed.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists camp in the tree tops, demanding the implementation of the "law of the Forests".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six days now, the activists have continuously occupied trees
inside a part of the Yungas forest that's a UNESCO Biosphere
Reserve. They'll stay there until "la Ley de Bosques" [the Forest
Law], legislation to protect Argentina's remaining forests, is
agreed by the Argentinean congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Argentina is calling for 1 million signatures to help
get the law passed, and has already collected over 600,000. If you
are Argentinean and have not yet signed, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/cyberacciones/bosques.html?MM_URL=GPI-feature"&gt;
please help by signing now&lt;/a&gt;.  While support from all is welcome,
we need signatures from Argentineans to get this law through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees the activists are living in are up to 25 metres high. 
A 'land team', camping on the forest floor, supports the activists
in the trees, and all of them are trained in jungle survival
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Argentinean forests going fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina's forests are in crisis. Forests are being chopped
down at a rate 8 times faster than the world average, clear cutting
a massive 300,000 hectares a year. To put that figure into context
- Argentina destroys an area of forest the size of 40 football
fields, every HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear cutting means just that; giant bulldozers with anchor
chains knock down all vegetation. Any "debris" is then cleared with
fire, in a matter of days ancient ecosystems are lost - forever.
The land is then used to grow genetically engineered soya, or for
cattle ranching. Jaguars are just one of endangered species, facing
extinction as a result of Argentina's rampant forest destruction,
others include armadillos and giant anteaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5HCAEl3kQPM"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is also one of the biggest sources of greenhouse
gas emissions. Worldwide deforestation is second only to the energy
sector as a contributor to climate change - responsible for up to
one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Law will establish a moratorium on forest conversion
for agriculture land, until a legitimate scheme for sustainable use
of Argentina's remaining forests is established. This needs to be a
transparent process, including indigenous and campesinos (peasant)
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reserva de la Biosfera de las Yungas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yungas rainforest is considered an international hot spot
for biodiversity by international bodies. Back in 2002, UNESCO
declared an area of the Yungas rainforests in Argentina as
'Biosphere Reserve' because of its rich and unique biodiversity.
The official name of the reserve is 'Reserva de la Biosfera de las
Yungas'. Greenpeace volunteers have chosen to occupy trees inside
this reserve, to highlight how even protected areas, are under
threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 34,000 people live in the Reserve and it is home to some
203 different bird species, including the eagle and the military
macaw; its 89 mammal types include the jaguar and the tapir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the UNESCO classification is to contribute
towards sustainable development and conservation. The expansion of
genetically engineered soya cultivation in Argentina makes a
mockery of Las Yungas Biosphere Reserve status, destroying its
unique ecosystems and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers will remain in the treetops until the Argentinean
senators takes urgent action to give green light to the forests law
and protect what's left of Argentinean forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/cyberacciones/bosques.html?MM_URL=GPI-feature"&gt;
If you are Argentinean please don't forget to join the hundreds of
thousands of people who are demanding the Senate immediately
approve La Ley de Bosques.&lt;/a&gt; (Sorry, Argentinean's only. But
everyone can help by &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="mailto:?body=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/jaguar-tree-camp070913"&gt;

	Greenpeace lit up central Prague for the past two evenings with giant projected slogans reminding the public, media and energy decision makers about the risks of nuclear power versus the benefits of clean energy. We illuminated Prague; we were also putting a spotlight on delegates at the second European Nuclear Energy Forum.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists project anti-nuclear slogans from a boat in Prague’s Vltava River during the formal dinner attended by delegates to the European Nuclear Energy Forum. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the public relations spin at face value, you might think
nuclear power has put behind it blunders like the Chernobyl
catastrophe of 1986 and is finally ready to deliver cheap, safe
power, overcome climate change and ensure energy security. All
together quite a set of claims! But, as Greenpeace highlighted this
week in Prague during the second meeting of the European Nuclear
Energy Forum, it's only the nuclear industry's propaganda that's
been revamped. The technology still can't deliver what's written on
the packet and the nuclear industry's ambitions remain as
unrealistic as ever. And it's having to rely on a heavily
pro-nuclear biased Forum to make its case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slogans in the night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace lit up central Prague for the past two evenings with
giant projected slogans reminding the public, media and energy
decision makers about the risks of nuclear power versus the
benefits of clean energy. Prague Castle formed the first backdrop
for "Nuclear underlines climate protection" and "Energy Revolution
NOW!", shone from an industrial-size beamer. The images featured a
shattered radiation motif symbolising the chronic flaws in nuclear
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, senior politicians and energy bosses attending the
Forum's formal dinner were treated to the shattered radiation
symbol and the words "Non, merci!". A strange choice, perhaps, for
a meeting in Prague - but it addresses the ambitions of the French
company AREVA, which is aggressively promoting its fault-ridden
European Pressurised Reactor as the supposed 'flagship' of an
international nuclear renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A funny thing happened on the way to the Forum…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forum was set up after EU Heads of State and Government in
March 2007 endorsed a European Commission proposal "to organise a
broad discussion among all relevant stakeholders on the
opportunities and risks of nuclear energy". Surprising, then, that
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, each with one seat in a Forum
of around 200 people, are the sole invitees from civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We welcome an open and fair debate on nuclear energy," says Jan
Beránek, nuclear energy campaigner from Greenpeace International.
"The arguments about cost, safety, energy security and tackling
climate change are all in favour of clean energy options."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open and fair debate? Think again. Bias was apparent from the
moment the Forum opened. Its first session offered a privileged
position to the CEO of the French nuclear company AREVA to promote
the supposedly cheaper and safer 'European Pressurised Reactor'
(EPR). You'd be forgiven for thinking that the Forum had become a
trade fair for the nuclear lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What happened in Prague was a mockery of a supposedly open
process," says Beránek. "The nuclear industry is arguing for yet
more financial support at the expense of safety, transparency and
respect for public opinion," he continued. A Eurobarometer survey
of public opinion on energy technologies, published in 2007, found
that only 20 percent of people in the EU support the use of nuclear
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Going soft on safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away from public scrutiny, the Forum has been considering a
proposal to lower nuclear safety standards across Europe to those
of the lowest level applied in any Member State. This could place a
stranglehold on national authorities wishing to impose stricter
safety standards. And by artificially lowering the costs of any
future nuclear plants, lenient safety standards would help open the
door for an expansion of nuclear power and expose the environment
and public safety to greater nuclear risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent events demonstrate that nuclear power remains as risky
and controversial as ever. In Spain, information about a recent
leak of radioactive material was kept secret. In Slovakia,
construction work is under preparation on the Mochovce nuclear
plant, which is based on a design from the 1970s and has no
'containment' in place to deal with external impacts. In Finland
and France, construction of the latest generation of French EPR
reactors is showing up the serious lack of competence in the
nuclear industry on issues as fundamental as pouring the concrete
base for the reactors, poor welding and inadequate and sometimes
non-existent quality control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Counter-propaganda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace aimed to blunt enthusiasm among Forum delegates for
the 'flagship' European Pressurised Reactor by distributing an 'EPR
Survival Kit'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entitled "Warning: AREVA at work!", the Greenpeace 'EPR Survival
Kit' was aimed at those foolhardy enough to overlook the chronic
problems affecting current construction of the Finnish and French
EPRs compared to the benefits of investing in energy saving and
renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightly coloured and intentionally flippant in tone, the
"Survival Kit' summarised the serious problems - ranging from poor
quality workmanship and severe delays through to significant cost
overruns. The EPR is a modern design of reactor developed and
aggressively promoted by the French nuclear company AREVA. It
promised cheap and reliable technology but costs in Finland have
exploded to over Euro 5 billion and the construction has been
riddled with faults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation.

<item><language>en</language><title>Back in court to protect the polar bear</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/back-in-court-to-protect-the-p052108/</url><text>
	Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity have launched a new legal challenge against the US Department of the Interior following its listing of the polar bear as a threatened species. Sadly the decision was made almost meaningless by the inclusion of a massive loophole (technically known as a “4(d) rule”) for global warming pollution. So now we and our allies are going back to court to make sure polar bears get the protection they deserve.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/polar-bears-on-sea-ice.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/polar-bears-on-sea-ice.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar bears on sea ice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announced on 14 May, the listing of polar bears as threatened
under the United States Endangered Species Act should have entitled
the bears to many protections. One of the primary protections is
the prohibition against any person, corporation, or other entity
"taking" a listed species, which includes killing or otherwise
harming it. However, the special 4(d) rule attempts to exempt from
regulation both greenhouse gas emissions and activities occurring
outside Alaska. Our new legal challenge aims to overturn this
"special rule".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;"While we successfully forced the administration to
list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act, the
administration is still undercutting all efforts to implement the
law to protect the polar bear,"&lt;/i&gt; said Melanie Duchin, global
warming campaigner for Greenpeace USA in Alaska. &lt;i&gt;"The
administration's continued attempt to block meaningful progress on
global warming is no surprise, but it won't
succeed."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clause is especially astounding after the US Geological
Survey predicted in September 2007 that, based on polar bear
distribution and current global warming projections, two-thirds of
the world's polar bear population would likely be extinct by 2050,
including all polar bears within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though global warming is the biggest threat facing polar
bears, this exemption eliminates any real protection the listing
could have provided for the polar bear. It specifically says
federal agencies don't need to consider the impact of global
warming pollution on the polar bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on
the sea-ice for all of their essential needs, including hunting
their prey. The rapid warming of the Arctic and melting of the
sea-ice poses a serious threat to polar bears. The polar bear could
be the first mammal to lose 100 percent of its habitat to global
warming.  As the ice continues to disappear, so will the polar
bear. The only way to save the polar bear is to stop global warming
and protect their sea-ice habitat from melting away, and the only
way to do that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic melt is also outpacing predictions. September 2007
shattered all previous records for sea-ice loss when the Arctic ice
cap shrank to a record 1 million square miles - equivalent to six
times the size of California - below the average summer sea-ice
extent of the past several decades, reaching levels not predicted
to occur until mid-century. Scientists already predict this year's
sea-ice minimum could shatter the record previously set in 2007.
Several leading scientists now predict the Arctic Ocean could be
ice-free in the summer by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/g8-petition"&gt;Be part of the climate solution : Join the Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Support our work to secure the future of the polar bear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Italian football team apparently love nothing better than a nice dollop of Nutella spread over their bread for breakfast – “breakfast for champions” according to Nutella, the official sponsors for the national team. But what else do Nutella’s owners, the Italian company Ferrero – official sponsor of the entire Euro 2008 Championship - support?

            Greenpeace activists dressed as orang-utans bring an alternative breakfast to the Italian national football team, asking them to join in the call for Nutella to 'Save the Forests' of Indonesia.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Nutella – a hazelnut-based sweet spread -is immensely popular in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/country-region&gt;,as well as the rest of &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt; and around theworld. Its exact ingredients are, as you might expect, are a closely guardedsecret, but according to two laboratories that analysed the spread forGreenpeace, it is composed of 31% vegetable oils, most of which is palm oil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Aside from pushing species, such as theorang-utan of &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;city w:st="on"&gt;Borneo&lt;/city&gt;, &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/country-region&gt;&lt;/place&gt;, to the brink ofextinction, the destruction of the world’s rainforests and peatlands to makeway for increased palm-oil plantations is driving climate change - every timethe rainforest is trashed, huge amounts of greenhouse gases are released intothe atmosphere. The destruction of rainforests accounts for a fifth of allgreenhouse gas emissions – that’s more than all the planes, trains and automobilesin the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;We sent along the “&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Borneo&lt;/place&gt;football team” – eleven orang-utans! – to explain. Arriving at the Italiansquad’s official training centre, the orang-utans presented the footballerswith an alternative “breakfast for champions” – a chocolate cream called &lt;i&gt;Deforestazione Zero &lt;/i&gt;– and asked them tosupport our call for Zero Deforestation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Greenpeace has been calling on Ferrero todeclare its purchasing policy on palm oil, to assure us and its customers thatNutella is not being produced from palm oil that comes from deforestation. Sofar, we’ve had no positive news, which is why we’re asking the Italian nationalteam to champion the cause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Ferrero is a member of the Roundtable onSustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an international association which has been put incharge of making the palm oil sector more sustainable. Despite the fact thatthe RSPO has existed since 2002, there is still no certified palm oil on themarket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Greenpeace has produced a report, “&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/hidden-carbon-liability-of-palm-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;TheHidden Carbon Liability of Indonesian Palm Oil&lt;/a&gt;”, which highlights theurgent need for global palm oil consumers and investors to support our call foran immediate moratorium on deforestation and peatland clearance in &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/country-region&gt;&lt;/place&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;One of the major companies using palm oilin its products is Unilever, which heads up the RSPO. Using Unilever's palm oilsupply chains as a case study to help quantify the carbon liability andcollateral risks associated with the Indonesian palm oil sector, the reportshows how, by buying palm oil from suppliers who account for more than &lt;b&gt;one-thirdof Indonesia's palm oil production&lt;/b&gt;, companies - including Ferrero and othermajor players such as Nestlé, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and Kraft - are increasingtheir potential carbon liability and thus leaving investors exposed topotentially significant levels of hidden risk, compromising long-term financialand brand stability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-monkey-business210408/"&gt;
&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Following Greenpeace pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;, Unilever has &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-palm-oil080501/"&gt;recognised the global problems associated with palmoil expansion&lt;/a&gt; and the need for drastic reform to this sector. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-challenge150508/"&gt;Unilever hastaken a bold move&lt;/a&gt; in supporting our call for an immediate moratorium ondeforestation and peatland clearance. While Unilever's position is strengthenedby its status as the largest single palm oil consumer in the world, companieslike Ferrero need to join with Unilever, support the moratorium and spread the callfor a halt to deforestation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments.

            A Greenpeace activist onboard the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior looks on as the vessel blocks coal shipments at the Pagbilao coal-fired power plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our action comes on the eve of the G8 Environment Ministers
Meeting in Japan. The richest industrialised countries in the world
are gathering in Kobe to discuss solutions to climate change from
24-26 May. Ending the use of coal needs to top the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-hundred-fifty kilometers southwest of Manila, the Rainbow
Warrior is anchored alongside the coal ship Medi Firenze, which is
unloading a cargo of coal at the plant's dock. This prevents a
bigger shipment of coal - from the 223-meter vessel Sam John Spirit
standing by to unload - from approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A giant banner reading "Quit coal" is strung between the Rainbow
Warrior's masts to drive home the message that the Philippine
government should stop building and expanding harmful coal-fired
power plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update - 25 May -&lt;/b&gt; We've ended our protest on a high note.
Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri sent a message of support to the Rainbow
Warrior saying, "I will file a resolution in the Senate seeking a
halt in the construction of new coal fired power plants in the
country."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippines at risk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is among the countries most vulnerable to rising
sea levels, more frequent cyclones and other devastating effects
from climate change. The coal plant's planned expansion would mean
an additional 5 million tons of climate-wrecking carbon dioxide
pumped into the atmosphere every year - double the plant's current
production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the expansion is not the only concern. The government is
currently planning to build eight new coal-fired power
stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time when we need to be doing everything we can to reduce
our emissions, we are importing more and more fossil fuel that we
don't need and which will bring consequences we simply cannot
afford. The banks and companies that fund our coal industry need to
realise that what looks like investment to them is going to mean
destruction for us," said Jasper Inventor, Climate Campaigner with
Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines have the capacity to produce 54 percent more
electricity than they use. However problems with the electricity
grid means the excess goes to waste rather than towards powering
people's homes, villages and towns. The government needs to invest
in resolving the problem of power transmission, rather than new
coal fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Governor calls for "coal free
zone"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government's plans are not only out of step with the global
fight to tackle climate change. Governor of Albay province in
Luzon, Joey Sarte Salceda, recently announced the province a coal
free zone. "Albay is taking a bold step .... by declaring ... a 'No
to mining and coal free zone'. We believe there is no place for
coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no
place for coal in Albay," he said. "I call on other nations,
particularly the developed nations, to reject coal." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector produces two-thirds of the world's climate
change-causing greenhouse gas emissions, with coal-fired power
stations the greatest offenders.  The Philippines already has eight
coal-fired power stations, which account for as much as 36 percent
of the country's energy emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clearly the national government is not serious about addressing
climate change," said Jasper Inventor. "If the government wants to
do right, the first thing on its list should be to quit coal and
ensure an end to coal construction and expansion. The government
must start phasing out of this dirty and dangerous power source
while increasingly tapping clean, safe, renewable energy. 
Renewable energy sources are abundant in the Philippines, the only
thing we need more of is the political will to deploy them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is in the Philippines to spearhead the
Greenpeace "Quit Coal Tour" in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Our
tour aims to promote solutions to stop climate change - an energy
revolution away from the use of climate-damaging coal, and a
massive shift to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/quit-coal/take-action"&gt;Take action by spreading the word!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation.

<item><language>en</language><title>Stone Age car lobby exposed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stone-age-car-lobby-exposed-260508/</url><text>
	Fred and Wilma Flintstone kindly lent their 'vintage' car to some of our activists for the day. We wanted to drive it to the European Parliament and deliver a stone tablet bearing the logos of Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes alongside the message "Driving climate change". The car industry is well and truly stuck in the stone age, with potentially dire consequences for the climate.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The car industry is still trapped in the "dinosaur dynamic" of building ever-faster and increasingly powerful gas-guzzlers at the expense of the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Flintstone's car journey started from the headquarters of
the European car lobby group ACEA. This group represents the major
European car manufactures and lobbies European politicians to
prevent growing carbon dioxide emissions from cars being
effectively curbed by regulation. Unfortunately &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/05/flintstones_arrested.html"&gt;
police arrested our car&lt;/a&gt; before it could reach the European
Parliament. In contrast lobbyists from the ACEA, determined to
ensure the special interests of the car industry come before
tackling climate change, continue to enjoy unfettered access to
European politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, Europe's MEPs are going to be discussing some new
proposals to make car manufacturers clean up their act. If the new
plans are approved, manufacturers will have to limit the amount of
carbon dioxide that comes out of car exhausts. We want MEPs to be
left in no doubt that these measures are desperately needed if
climate change is to be effectively limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures are not before time. Our new report &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/DrivingClimateChange"&gt;
"Driving Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt; reveals how the car industry, led by
the German car companies, has misled and manipulated Europe's
policy makers for the past 17 years, to stop them from imposing
mandatory limits on emissions. Each time Europe has suggested
introducing legislation, car makers have been quick to claim that
laws aren't needed because they will take sufficient action
voluntarily. Of course they've done no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the industry has used gains in performance to build
heavier and more powerful cars rather than deliver more fuel
efficiency. The EU has let them get away with it. Now they realise
that the car industry's stone age attitude might mean Europe could
miss its carbon emission reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="width" value="425"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The willingness of the EU to roll over in the past has no doubt
been helped by some of the underhand lobbying tactics employed by
the car industry. Our report details how manufacturers have
rewarded political supporters with loaned cars and other perks and
explains how Europe's Commissioner with responsibility for
enterprise and industry, Verheugen, formed an influential lobby
group, CARS 21, which used his access at the very highest levels to
lean on policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the EU is pledging to take action. To be effective the
legislation must ensure the average new car sold in 2012 emits just
120g of CO2 per km, and for that standard to be strengthened to a
limit of 80g p/km by 2020. Even though the EU is currently
proposing legislation that doesn't &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/12/why_the_european_efficiency_pr.html"&gt;
do quite enough&lt;/a&gt; the car industry is fighting tooth and nail to
make sure it doesn't go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament must stand firm and resist the car
lobby's attempts to run down the EU's first ever fuel economy
standard. The new law should also impose penalties on manufacturers
who fail to meet the new standards and resist attempts to give
special treatment to the makers of heavy cars. If they do, the car
industry will finally have met its match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/merkel-cars-letter/"&gt;Please write to the Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, today asking her to support strong emissions standards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With our gallant activists barely out oftheir orang-utan suits, and with our Dove parody running on YouTube for a meretwo weeks, we were somewhat taken aback by the sheer speed with which ourcampaign has met with success! Sometimes it takes a lot longer to make acompany, corporation or government see the error of its ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;But our work is not yet done! Palm oil isused for a wide range of products – from toothpaste to margarine, and fromwashing powders to soaps. Following our meeting with Unilever last week,agreements on what needs to happen next are now taking shape. Even thoughUnilever is the biggest buyer of palm oil, it represents only three percent of palmoil purchasers. The moratorium will need support from other companies if wewant to see real change in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unilever has agreed to rise to thechallenge and lead the way, building a coalition of allies to put pressure on palmoil suppliers in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;to agree to the moratorium. This includes lobbying all the major players in theindustry, including Kraft, Nestlé, Cadburys, Cargill and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Over the coming months, we’ll be meetingwith companies and urging them to join Unilever in supporting the moratoriumand stopping deforestation and the release of greenhouse gases that fuel climatechange. This coalition of influential players in the palm oil industry –together with the support of palm oil suppliers and the Indonesian government -is key to getting the moratorium in place as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There's still a long way to go to ensure that
the climate is protected from further deforestation, that the
bulldozers leave the rainforest and that orang-utans are saved from
extinction in the wild. We'll be keeping you updated - and we'll be
letting you know if we need your help again to put pressure on any
company that may need a bit of an incentive to support the

	France’s nuclear safety agency today took the commendable step of ordering construction work to be halted on the concrete base slab of the new European Pressurised Reactor, Flamanville 3, in northern France. Over recent months, the agency’s inspectors have uncovered a string of chronic faults in construction -- which only began in December 2007.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The French nuclear safety agency agrees: it's time to stop the construction of the European Pressurized Water Reactor.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues seem to have come to a head on 21 May. Maybe that
explains why Anne Lauvergeon, Chief Executive Officer of AREVA, the
French nuclear company aggressively backing the European
Pressurised Reactor (EPR), 'exploded' when we handed her a copy of
the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-survival-kit/"&gt;
Greenpeace 'EPR Survival Kit'&lt;/a&gt; during the European Nuclear
Energy Forum on the 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, for nuclear regulators in France, enough is enough.
We can only hope that their move is not merely a temporary setback
to construction but the beginning of the end of a failed experiment
in building the world's largest nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we pointed out to Europe's energy policymakers at the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/illuminating-the-manipulation/"&gt;
last week's European Nuclear Energy Forum, "Nuclear power? Non,
merci!"&lt;/a&gt; is the correct response to anyone approaching you to
buy an EPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;French letters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulators' call to halt construction follows a series of
letters from the agency to Flamanville's construction manager. In
the letters, inspectors highlighted a range of problems including
&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority-3.pdf"&gt;
non-conformities in the pinning of the steel framework&lt;/a&gt; of the
concrete base slab, incorrectly positioned reinforcements,
inadequacy of technical inspection by both the construction
companies and Electricité de France. Inspectors also uncovered
inconsistencies between the blueprint for reinforcement work and
the plan for its practical implementation. The incorrect
composition of concrete had been used, that may lead to cracks and
rapid deterioration in sea air conditions. Samples of concrete were
also not collected properly, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority-2.pdf"&gt;
according to inspectors&lt;/a&gt;. Cracks have already been observed in
part of the base slab beneath the reactor building. The supplier of
the steel containment liner reportedly lacks the necessary
qualifications. Fabrication of the liner was continuing despite
quality failures demonstrating the lack of competence of the
supplier. As a result, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority.pdf"&gt;
one-quarter of the welds of the steel liner of the reactor
containment building were deficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Déjà vu all over again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new reactors Flamanville 3 and Olkiluoto 3, in Finland, are
supposedly the vanguard of a 'renaissance' in nuclear power,
leading to a whole series of these type of reactors being built
around the world. (It certainly seems to be a renaissance in the
kinds of problems we hoped would be relegated to history as the
number of a new nuclear builds declined in the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems at Flamanville echo those with the first EPR, Olkiluoto
3, which has been under construction for three years but has been
blighted ever since the concrete was poured. Poor quality concrete,
bad welds on the containment liner and low-quality reactor
components are among its problems. The schedule for completion has
been put back by more than two years and estimated costs have
nearly doubled to over Euro 5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flamanville 3 is the umpteenth example of the nuclear industry
failing to learn the lessons of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cradle to grave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the problems of an unbuilt reactor aren't enough of a
headache for the nuclear industry, the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7421879.stm"&gt;BBC
reports&lt;/a&gt; that in the UK the cost of cleaning up old nuclear
sites, including some deemed "dangerous" will soar beyond 144
billion Euros (US$ 91 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has consistently argued that nuclear power is an
unnecessarily complex, risky and expensive way to boil water, to
raise steam, to generate power. James Watt will be turning in his
grave. In defiance of all logic, enormous sums of public money have
been devoted to unsuccessfully overcoming the technical obstacles
inherent to nuclear power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time policymakers and power companies realised that
businesses and citizens want clean reliable power at an affordable
price rather than new monuments to the pursuit of technological
folly. What's more, preventing dangerous climate change means
halving global carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century. &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy efficiency
improvements and expansion of clean energy supply&lt;/a&gt; - not more
nuclear capacity - are the key to delivering this energy
revolution.  &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Endangered Species Act threatens Polar Bears</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/endangered-polar-bears150508/</url><text>
	For the last three years, the US Department of Interior has been dragging its feet when it comes to protecting the polar bear. It has now finally listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. This might seem like a victory but there are enough exemptions in this listing to leave the polar bear unprotected against its biggest threat, global warming.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar Bears on an ice shelf. Mother and cub.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of calculated delays and several lawsuits against
them, brought by Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defence Council
and the Center for Biological Diversity, the Bush administration
has listed the polar bear as threatened under the United States
Endangered Species Act (ESA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threatened listing under the ESA is supposed to provide broad
protection to polar bears. This includes a requirement that United
States federal agencies ensure that any action carried out,
authorised, or funded by the United States government will not
"jeopardise the continued existence" of polar bears, or adversely
modify their critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the decision comes with a big catch: an exemption
(technically known as a "4(d) exemption") for global warming
pollution. Global warming is the biggest threat facing polar bears
and this exemption eliminates any real protection the listing could
have provided for the polar bear. It specifically says federal
agencies don't need to consider the impact of global warming
pollution on the polar bear. It gets worse: the listing also
proposes a separate regulation that reduces the protections the
polar bear would otherwise receive under the ESA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might look like a listing to protect the polar bear but
it's really just a way for the administration to protect the
interests of the oil and gas industry, as well as get away without
taking action on global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does the science say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision about whether or not to list a species under the ESA
is supposed to be based on the best available science. The best
available, most current science on the impact of global warming on
polar bears is clear: the species faces extinction because its
Arctic ice habitat is melting. Sea ice melts and refreezes
seasonally, but recent years have shown a smaller area of maximum
sea ice in the winter. Predictions about Arctic sea ice loss have
become worse with each passing year.  A few years ago, scientists
were predicting the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer as
early as 2100, then that prediction was moved up to 2050, then 2040
and 2030.  Late last year, one leading scientist predicted the
Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summer as soon as 2012. It seems
clear that the pace of global warming in the Arctic is outrunning
predictions and is happening faster than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have been following this issue for quite some time, and I
have seen firsthand the impacts of global warming in the Arctic.
I've been in Alaska's Beaufort Sea when the sea ice retreated so
far offshore that a lone polar bear was stranded in open water,
swimming for what little ice it could find in search of its ringed
seal prey that were hundreds of miles away at the ice edge.   That
bear was not long for this world, and the image haunts me every
time I read another grim report about the plight of polar bears in
our warming world," said Melanie Duchin, a global warming
campaigner for Greenpeace US, based in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25177/polar-bear-on-sea-ice.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the US Geological Survey predicted that by 2050, two
thirds of the world's polar bears would disappear, including all of
the polar bears in the United States. Scientists are witnessing
evidence that polar bears are already in real trouble. Reduced food
supplies due to global warming has resulted in polar bears actually
resorting to cannibalism in the north coast of Alaska and Canada.
Scientists with the US Minerals Management Service documented the
drowning of at least four polar bears in September 2004, when the
sea ice retreated a record 160 miles off the state's northern
coast. Just last week, scientists in Alaska reported that fewer
polar bear yearlings are making it to maturity. The polar bear
population in Western Hudson Bay of Canada has declined from
approximately 1200 bears in 1987, to 1,100 bears in 1995, and then
to fewer than 950 bears in 2004 due to ice loss. Arctic sea ice
loss set a record low in 2007.  This year, the sea ice melt season
is already shaping up to break the record set in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Polar bears and sea ice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on
the sea ice for all of their essential needs, including hunting
their prey. The rapid warming of the Arctic and melting of the sea
ice poses a serious threat to polar bears. The polar bear could be
the first mammal to lose 100 percent of its habitat to global
warming.  As the ice continues to disappear, so will the polar
bear. The only way to save the polar bear is to stop global warming
and protect their sea ice habitat from melting away, and the only
way to do that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the Bush administration is ignoring the science that
is staring it in the face: global warming is threatening polar
bears with extinction. The federal government's press release
carried the headline, "Secretary Kempthorne Announces Decision to
Protect Polar Bears under Endangered Species Act," but it's clearly
mistitled. It would have been more aptly written if it had said,
"Secretary Kempthorne Announces Decision to Protect Oil and Gas
Industry."  Exempting global warming pollution caused by unabated
oil and gas drilling spells doom for the polar bear, pure and
simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those reading this and thinking that, while saving the polar
bear is a laudable goal,  what's more important is drilling for
oil, jobs and the economy, consider these facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US will never be able to drill its way to energy
independence since it has only three to four percent of global oil
reserves, yet burns one-quarter of the world's oil.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Arctic is a harbinger for things to come at lower
latitudes. What we see now in the Arctic - unprecedented sea ice
loss and species threatened with extinction - will not be limited
to the Arctic.  Serious global warming impacts and species'
extinction will accelerate in the mid-latitudes as it is in the
Arctic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stalling action now means more disruption and economic cost
down the line. It's not just about polar bears and the Arctic, the
entire country will benefit if the government replaces dirty
sources of energy such as oil, gas and coal with cleaner, climate
friendly forms of energy like solar and wind.  Conservation can go
a long way toward cutting US energy needs as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pacific islands act to save tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pacific-saves-tuna210508/</url><text>
	Finally, some good news for tuna stocks and a first step towards protecting the Pacific Commons for future generations! Eight Pacific island countries have taken the most significant action ever to combat overfishing in the region.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years fishing fleets from distant countries have plundered
the Pacific's tuna, riding roughshod over legitimate concerns of
Pacific island countries. In December last year, Japan, Taiwan,
Korea and mainland China all blocked conservation measures at the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting.
And as we have witnessed over the past two months at sea in the
Pacific Commons - their fleets are continuing to decimate the tuna
stocks and threaten the future of Pacific livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the tide has turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New rules &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new agreement, foreign fishing vessels licensed to
fish in the waters of eight Pacific island countries will be banned
from fishing in two regions of the Pacific Commons adjacent to
these countries. This is a giant stride towards these areas
becoming marine reserves and towards the protection of Pacific
tuna. This is exactly what we have been pushing for since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eight countries (Parties to the Nauru Agreement) include the
Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru,
Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Most of the
tuna stocks from the Pacific, valued at US$ 3 billion a year, come
from the waters of these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25174/pacificmarinereserves.jpg" alt="Pacific Commons map" height="344" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;The orange areas mark the Pacific
Commons, which we want to see protected. The grey areas mark the
EEZs -- the national fishing waters. ©Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;No more throwing back the low-value fish &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign fishing vessels will also be required to retain their
full catches. This will cut the time fishing boats spend at sea and
the amount of tuna they catch. At present they throw away non-tuna
species to make room in their holds for the more valuable catch. It
will also be compulsory to carry fisheries observers on board at
all times. The use of fish aggregation devices (used to attract
juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna) will be banned in these
countries' waters for three months of the year. This is a
conservation measure designed to discourage harvesting of these
highly migratory species. These new rules will take effect on 15
June, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship Esperanza has been in these areas for the last seven
weeks highlighting this issue. During this time we have taken
action against fishing fleets from Taiwan, Korea, the US and the
Philippines. We are calling for the these areas to become no-take
marine reserves and - politicians willing - that will become a
reality before the year is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will we see similar protection of other tuna fisheries? We're
working on it. Our ship Arctic Sunrise is on a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/" title="Med tour"&gt;three-month tour of the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;
demanding protection for the tuna fisheries there as well -- and
marine reserves are the answer again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25174/greenpeace-activists-demonstra.jpg" alt="Greenpeace in action to protect tuna" height="257" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First step towards healthy oceans for a healthy planet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting the Pacific Commons would be the first step toward
achieving our overall campaign goal:  to protect 40 percent of our
oceans with a global network of marine reserves.  Keeping the
oceans alive is essential to keeping our planet alive. As global
warming takes its toll on our already stressed marine ecosystems,
we need to protect the most vulnerable areas so they stand a better
chance of survival. In order to ensure the world has fish in the
future, we need marine reserves now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Dead oceans, dead planet. Sign our petition asking the United Nations to endorse protecting 40 percent of our oceans with no-take marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Help keep the Esperanza out on the high seas catching pirates and stopping overfishing. Every contribution helps.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Facing up to illegal forest destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-illegal-timber-law-020708/</url><text>
	Illegal logging often happens in far-off places that are all too easily ignored. That's why we have brought the problem to the heart of Europe - with a 12-metre Amazon tree trunk placed in Brussels to highlight the role of Europe in fuelling the destruction of the world's rainforests.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/eu-forests-law-amazon.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/eu-forests-law-amazon.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists take the message "Ban illegal timber" to the EU Commission Headquarters.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed Brazilian artist Siron Franco has installed nine video
monitors into the trunk of an Amazon tree that comes from an area
in Brazil where illegal logging is rampant. The tree has been
placed outside the European Commission's headquarters and contrasts
images of the natural beauty of the rainforest with the ongoing
destruction caused by illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is part of our ongoing campaign to force the EU
to introduce a new timber law. This would see a long overdue ban on
illegal timber being sold in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Environment Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, and other EU
politicians are planning to visit the tree, where our activists
will present them with a plywood postcard reading: 'Stop the
chainsaw massacre! Adopt EU timber law now' to remind them why it
is vital to protect the world's last remaining rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Europe buys millions of tonnes of timber from
areas such as the Amazon, South East Asia and the Congo, where
illegal and destructive logging is rampant. As a result, customers
in Europe, buying products like garden furniture, paper tissues,
and construction materials, are unwitting accomplices in the
destruction of the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, the EU has been promising to introduce
new laws against illegally harvested timber, but those companies
profiteering from illegal logging have been obstructing the efforts
being made by the European Commission. However, on July 23, the
European Commission will finally vote on whether to adopt a new
law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the European Commission hasn't got much choice
if it is serious about tackling climate change. We urgently need to
stop destroying the world's forests. Practices such as illegal and
destructive logging drive deforestation, which in turns leads to
the dramatic loss of species and accounts for one fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our supporters have been instrumental in making sure
that the issue hasn't fallen off of the Commission's agenda. Since
June 17, over &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;
65,000 letters have been sent&lt;/a&gt; to the EU President, José Manuel
Barroso. Progressive companies working in the timber industry have
also been pushing for the new law - they are suffering at the hands
of rogue businesses involved in illegal and destructive logging who
undercut prices, make sustainable wood less competitive and harm
the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU already has strict controls on illegal music, software
and films. It's high time timber stolen from the world's last
rainforests was just as strictly controlled as pirate CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;Please write to President Barroso today for a strong EU timber law.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	When you're in the business of saving the future - and you give yourself a specific deadline, such as 2050 - you need to make sure that every single day between then and now counts. Unfortunately, the G8 Summit was a waste of three whole days. Gathering in Toyako, Japan, G8 leaders offered nothing new on the food crisis, gave the wrong answer to rising oil prices and deferred climate action. 
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            George Bush attends his last ever G8 Summit - so it's not all bad news, then...
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our political advisor, Daniel Mittler, who was in Toyako
throughout, has been providing regular updates: from the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/rain_in_a_ski_resort_a_sad_but.html" target="_blank"&gt;wet and dismal start to the proceedings&lt;/a&gt;,
through the G8's &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/solving_the_food_crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;working lunches, working dinners and working
lunches while discussing the global food crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and to the
bitter end - a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/g8_climate_statement_this_is_a.html" target="_blank"&gt;final statement&lt;/a&gt; that showed they hadn't made
much progress whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned from the G8's three wasted days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1.    Never do today what you can keep putting off until
tomorrow...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global emissions have to start falling by 2015 and must be cut
by more than 50 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. With the
G8 countries accounting for 62 percent of greenhouse gas emissions,
it's clear that industrialised countries need to take the lead,
cutting emissions by at least 30 percent by 2020, and by between 80
and 90 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 in fact called on the world to aim for a 50 percent goal
- and not more - in 2050, and failed to give any clear commitments
on mid-term measures; this is simply not good enough. We need
action today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/ENVIRONMENT/EXTCC/0,,contentMDK:21713769~menuPK:4860081~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:407864,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;World Bank Climate Investment Funds&lt;/a&gt; that the
G8 has announced do not even exclude coal, the world's most
polluting energy source. Unless we end our addiction to fossil
fuels and start an energy revolution based on renewable energy and
energy efficiency now, the world of 2050 will be a nightmarish one
indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the G8 leaders have effectively done is postpone the
responsibility for tackling global climate change to future
generations; to the politicians who succeed them, and to the
children who will have to live in the nightmare world of 2050 as
envisioned by the G8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.    Never miss the opportunity - whatever the crisis - to
make a quick sale…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush, Berlusconi and others have used the G8 meeting to act as
lobbyists for their own energy giants, trying to sell dangerous,
expensive and uninsurable nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fact that nuclear energy today is based on risky
reactors, leads to proliferation and security hazards and produces
long lived deadly nuclear waste with no solution for its safe
disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that nuclear power will save the climate is absurd and
downright dangerous. We need solutions based on renewables and
energy efficiency to defeat climate change and ensure true energy
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not even as though it's difficult for the G8 to find these
solutions - we set it all out, loud and clear, for them in our &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25145/energyrevolutionreport.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; last year. Maybe
it's time for the G8 leaders to get their heads down into reading
this report, instead of having their heads in the (hopefully, not
mushroom-shaped) clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.    You can have your cake &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; eat it - so long as
it's genetically modified…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's said, "You are what you eat." Yet, the G8 continues to
support treating our soil like dirt, contaminating our water with
toxic chemicals and the planting of more GE crops that yield less
and fail under bad weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial agriculture has undermined global food security and
led us to a food crisis. Rather than shift public investment to
proven ecological methods that provide higher yields, better food
and more resilience to climate change, the G8 leaders repeat their
usual mantra that countries should rely on the global market for
their food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, Bush, Berlusconi and others have been pushing
for genetically engineered food as the solution to the food crisis.
They pretend that liberalising trade will lower food prices. It has
not and will not - all it will do is drive poor farmers, especially
those in the developing world, off their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need farming that is ecological and biodiverse, rather than
continuing with chemical-intensive farming or pursuing the false
promise of genetic engineering. We need public investment in
research and development on ecological and climate change resilient
farming; the end of funding for GE crops and the prohibition of
patents on seeds; and the phasing out of the most toxic chemicals
and the elimination of environmentally-destructive agricultural
subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time for G8 leaders to admit that their old policies have
failed and that they need to start building a trade system based on
equity and sustainability; that 'business as usual' is not an
option. Instead, they fell back on their usual ritual of calling
for a swift end to the Doha Round of trade talks, failing to
recognise that further trade liberalisation will spell disaster for
poor people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Daniel Mittler's reports show, the G8 leaders had plenty of
food…but little thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4.    Acknowledge the problem, and hopefully it'll go
away…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 acknowledged there are unsustainable biofuels - but
didn't do anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this inaction even more land will be diverted away from
food production - mandatory biofuel targets in developed countries
need to be suspended and legislation introduced to ensure biofuel
production does not threaten food security, particularly in
developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And due to this inaction, even more forests will be felled -
increasing global climate change.  Protecting intact forests is
crucial for preserving biodiversity and combating climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is running out, but the answer to the world's transport
needs does not lie with unsustainable biofuels. In order to satisfy
the rich world's addiction to cars, instead we are simply driving
deforestation, driving the food crisis and driving climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the G8 may have driven through all the climate red
lights and stop signs in Toyako.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5.    Always look on the bright side of life…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Arctic ice is melting, the G8 froze into inaction.
Instead of protecting the climate, the G8 effectively protected the
interests of industry, most notably the nuclear and GE industries.
We're no further forward than where we were a year ago, at the last
G8 meeting in Heiligendamm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;But, the one good thing about this G8
meeting is that it was US President George W. Bush's last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any money from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Mister Splashy Pants just heard that two of his Greenpeace pals have been arrested.  He, too, is amazed that they've been locked up for exposing the truth -- and he's going to do something about it. Are you?

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace activists expose an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;
embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; involving whale meat which is costing
Japanese taxpayers millions of yen. Forty cops swoop down on the
Greenpeace offices to arrest the Greenpeace activists instead of
the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global storm follows: hundreds of thousand of supporters &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;write to the Japanese
government&lt;/a&gt;. Diplomatic protests are lodged by whale-friendly
governments. Vigils and demonstrations are held outside Japanese
embassies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story prompts people all around the world to take
extraordinary action. Now another hero steps up to do what must be
done. Help Mister Splashy Pants free the Tokyo Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is this Mister Splashy Pants dude, you ask? In the real
world, he's a humpback whale we &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
tracked with a satellite tag&lt;/a&gt; heading from the Solomon Islands
toward the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary -- that safe haven in
which the Japanese government kills around 1,000 whales every year
for "scientific research." He was named in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Splashy_Pants"&gt;online
competition&lt;/a&gt; in which his share of the 100,000 votes clobbered
all rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Japanese whalers were heading toward the Southern
Ocean planning to add humpbacks to the whale species they kill
every year. Public pressure from whale supporters worldwide brought
diplomatic protest to bear, however, and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
Japanese backed down on plans to kill humpbacks&lt;/a&gt; -- for now,
anyway. (They still kill minke and fin whales, but our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/551-whales-too-many-140408/"&gt;
direct non-violent actions helped ensure they killed fewer of them
this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants was saved by whale activists like you,
Junichi and Toru. So he reckoned it was time to return the favour.
Help him out by spreading the word: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;Free the Tokyo
Two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Australian smokestack occupied for 33 hours</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/swanbank-coal-occupation140708/</url><text>
	Over the weekend, four activists from Greenpeace Australia occupied the top of a 140-metre high smokestack for 33 hours enduring near freezing temperatures overnight. They began the two-hour descent yesterday, at Swanbank B coal fired power plant near Brisbane, leaving a message for Australia's leaders - "Go Solar!"- painted on the side of the smoke stack. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists abseiled off the side of a 140-metre coal smokestack and painted the message "Go Solar".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon descending, Greenpeace energy campaigner Julien Vincent,
who was part of the climbing team, said they sent the message that
the situation is urgent and we have to act fast on climate change.
This means revolutionising the way Australia generates energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists climbed the stack at dawn on Friday, 11 July and
spent a night up the top in near-freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1VI3NhAAofA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why did we do this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did this to get the message out that Australia urgently needs
to cut greenhouse gas emissions. They must start replacing old and
dirty coal fired power stations, like this one at Swanbank, with
true clean renewable energy, like solar. It is tragic that
Queensland, with the best solar resources in the world, is not a
leader in the booming global renewable energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;33 hours for a renewable energy future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists' occupation of the 37-year-old Swanbank B
coal-fired plant began at 5.30am on Friday 11 July. Of 13 activists
who entered the plant yesterday morning, nine were arrested before
they started climbing the stack. The remaining four were arrested
after 33 hours up top of the major climate changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swanbank B is responsible for more than two million tonnes of
carbon emissions a year - that's the annual pollution of 300,000
cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The world's best solar resource&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every home in Queensland switched to solar water heating,
Swanbank B could be switched off. We want a commitment from
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to close Swanbank by the next
election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is way behind many other countries in developing
renewable energy. In the next 18 months Spain will roll out enough
solar thermal power to replace Swanbank B power station four times
over. If Australia makes the right choices it could become a
powerhouse for renewable energy manufacturing and technological
development, creating thousands of new jobs and investment
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Government's climate change advisor, Professor
Ross Garnaut, says that if Australians do not successfully combat
climate change, theGreat Barrier Reef will die and they will lose
50,000 jobs and $5 billion in tourism dollars each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs in coal can be replaced by jobs in renewable energy. There
is no way to replace the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers embarks on a synchronized propaganda campaign aligned with Alberta's "rebranding" of its oil-extracting tar sands project, Greenpeace has launched its own website to paint the greenwash in its true colour: a deep, oily black.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/"&gt;TravellingAlberta.com&lt;/a&gt;
is a tongue-in-cheek travel site that uses humour to communicate a
very serious issue to Canadian and international audiences about
the destructive nature of the world's largest industrial
development. The website showcases  some of the unique attractions
that await travelers to Alberta: Black sand beaches, toxic lakes
and clearcut forests. Until now, this kind of vacation destination
was merely the stuff of science fiction; but now, it can be
experienced first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We thought we'd help the province and the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers  with their "rebranding" campaign by
bringing Alberta's newest tourist attractions to the world's
doorstep. Any visitor to the Alberta tar sands can see the
pollution, smell the sulfur, taste the toxins and hear the air
cannons - we're saving them the trip," says Mike Hudema, a tar
sands campaigner with Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Premier Ed Stelmach and theCanadian Association of Petroleum
Producers can spend 25 million dollars of tax payers' money trying
to cleanup the image of the tar sands, but this development is
still dirty, ugly and foul. That money would be much better spent
cleaning up the tar sands themselves, rather than just the global
image."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a real cleanup of the area is still a way off, the
current state of northern Alberta offers a rare treat for the
seasoned globetrotter who is craving something new. A seemingly
endless expanse of bitumen-laden sands - coupled with the powerful
scent of oil from refineries wafting through the hazy air - makes
Northern Alberta a truly one-of-a-kind destination. As families
make their vacation plans, TravellingAlberta.com offers these
adventure tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversion surfing:&lt;/b&gt; Catch a wave, Alberta-style, and join
Big Oil in taking advantage of the nearly 92 billion gallons of
water diverted from provincial rivers each year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal sightings:&lt;/b&gt; Moose playing in tailings ponds, loons
drenched in tar and ducks sinking in oil: it's not everywhere that
you can see some of Canada's most prized wildlife in these unique
settings. Hurry though! They're going fast!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tailings sailing:&lt;/b&gt; Come enjoy the vast lakes of toxic
water, so big they're visible to the naked eye from space! Chase
that horizon, but be careful not to capsize!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun in the sun:&lt;/b&gt; Forget Cancun, Alberta is sizzling!
Boasting more greenhouse gas emissions than Canada's three other
most populous provinces combined, it's really heating up out
here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will promote the website internationally, calling on
visitors to share the site with friends and to write Premier Ed
Stelmach, Travel Minister Cindy Ady and Prime Minister Stephen
Harper to demand they put the brakes on tar sand development.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace blockades Australian coal-fired power station</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-blockades-australia/</url><text>
	Greenpeace activists, including an ex-miner from the Hunter Valley, blockaded Australia's most polluting coal-fired power station to call for an Energy [R]evolution. Entering the plant in the early hours of the morning, 16 activists were able to lock themselves to the conveyors that distribute the coal.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist inside Eraring Power Station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the last activists had been removed from the site,
coal supply had been halted for about five hours - for every hour
supply was stopped, we prevented 2000 tonnes of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; from being released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd's turn to act on
climate change and energy. Greenpeace's Australian supporters are
being asked to sign a petition urging Rudd to commit to phasing out
dirty coal and building a clean, safe and reliable energy future
for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Eraring power station?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia-Pacific's climate and energy campaigner,
Simon Roz, explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to stop fuelling climate change when creating
electricity. Eraring is old and inefficient - it's Australia's
dirtiest coal-fired power plant, sending nearly 20 million tonnes
of greenhouse pollution into the atmosphere every year. It's one of
the eight coal-fired power stations in New South Wales responsible
for half the state's and 13% of Australia's greenhouse
pollution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the activists blockading the coal conveyor was Graham
Brown, a retired Hunter Valley coal miner. He said, "I feel very
strongly that we must start making the transition from coal-power
to renewable energy. Coal communities have been taken advantage of
by coal companies and governments. Renewable energy is the future,
and it's bright. Workers must be retrained and re-skilled so that
they don't miss out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable technology is already there, we don't have to wait 20
years for it - but we need a transition mechanism in place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action came in advance of Australian government's climate
change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, delivering his draft review
on climate change. Any urgent action to be taken on climate change
must include policies that support renewables to replace dirty
coal-fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon Roz says, "Renewable energy can replace coal-fired
power and would be a huge step forward in reducing emissions in
line with Professor Garnaut's recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is just the latest of many countries in which
Greenpeace has released national Energy [R]evolution reports
showing how renewables combined with energy efficiency, can provide
all of that country's energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace released its global &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energyrevolutionreport/" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The
scenario shows how renewables can replace coal by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Energy [R]evolutionary!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;Send a message to world leaders who are meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU and become energy [r]evolutionaries! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of getting the electronics
industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want
manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We
want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers
scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's
gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 the Guide is now on its 8th
edition. It ranks the top market leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games console markets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals and take-back. It has been a key
driving force in getting many of the companies to make significant
improvements to their environmental policies. New to this edition
are &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/improved-criteria-explained/"&gt;
criteria&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of electronics companies on
tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="237"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25153/ranking-guide-8th-edition.swf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are scored on disclosure of their greenhouse gas
emissions, commitment for absolute cuts in their own emissions and
support for the mandatory global emissions reductions that are
needed to tackle climate change. On energy efficiency, a selection
of each company's product range is assessed to see how far they
exceed the current de-facto global standard, the US Environmental
Protection Agency's &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home.index" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Star&lt;/a&gt;. Energy Star sets minimum standards
for energy efficiency for many types of &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductCategory&amp;amp;pcw_code=HEF" target="_blank"&gt;electronic products&lt;/a&gt;. The overall percentage of
renewable energy in a companies total energy use is also
assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector
currently accounts for two percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions, equal to the aviation industry. As one of the most
innovative and fastest growing industries, the biggest electronics
companies must show leadership in tackling climate change by
reducing both their direct and indirect climate change
footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our international toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska has noticed
stark contrasts while compiling the Guide: "Electronics giants pay
attention to environmental performance on certain issues, while
ignoring others that are just as important. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt;, for example, scores well on chemicals and energy
criteria, but scores a zero on e-waste since it has no global
take-back polices. Philips would score higher if it took
responsibility for its own branded e-waste and established
equitable global take-back schemes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies score well on energy efficiency as their products
comply and exceed Energy Star standards. The best performers on
energy efficiency are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sony-Ericsson-8"&gt;
Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electrnoics-Apple-8"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt;, with all of their models meeting, and many exceeding,
Energy Star requirements. Sony Ericsson stands out as the first
company to score almost top marks on all of the chemicals criteria.
With all new Sony Ericsson models being PVC-free, the company has
also met the new chemicals criterion in the ranking, having already
banned antimony, beryllium and phthalates from models launched
since January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple missed a big chance to advance its score by not improving
the environmental performance of the new version of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies that promote their 'green' policies come up short
when measured against global standards of measuring impacts on
climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Dell-8"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt; scores relatively poorly while Toshiba, Samsung and LGE
score close to, or zero, on climate change criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the games console makers, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Microsoft-8"&gt;
Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; drops to second bottom of the Guide with a low score
on climate criteria. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Nintendo-8"&gt;
Nintendo's score&lt;/a&gt; increases slightly with some improvement on
toxic chemicals and climate policy. However, even Nintendo's
relatively energy efficient Wii console does not meet Energy Star
standards that cover minimum &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers"&gt;
energy efficiency standards for PCs and consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real green leaders?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most companies now scoring less than 5/10, only a company
that rises to the challenge of phasing out toxic chemicals,
increasing the recycling rate of e-waste, using recycled materials
in new products and reducing their impact on climate change can
seriously hope to make the claim of being green.&lt;/p&gt;

	“We believe there is no place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no place for coal in Albay”That was the statement of Governor Joey Sarte Salceda, setting the tone for our one month Quit Coal tour of the Philippines. Since the Rainbow Warrior arrived in the country we’ve taken our Quit Coal message to the places it needed to be heard, and generated real progress on the ground and in the corridors of power.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers light candles in front of Jaro Cathedral - sending a message supporting Iloilo people's demand to the Philippine government for a cleaner, safer, future powered by renewable energy. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pagbilao, we went into action to blockade shipments of coal.
The peaceful actions of our local activists and the crew of the
Rainbow Warrior helped secure commitment from leading politicians
to bring the Renewables Energy Bill to the floor of the Philippine
Senate. The bill has already been passed by the Philippine
Congress, but had been ignored by the Senate. Now we've secured the
support of influential senators, including the chair of the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a coal-free Philippines.
The threat of climate change demands a shift towards a sustainable,
clean and low carbon future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taguig City, we painted the Quit Coal message onto the
driveway of the Department of Energy. Head of that department is
Secretary Reyes, who as chairman of the Presidential Task Force on
Climate Change should have known better than to sanction the
construction or expansion of nine coal fired power stations in a
country with huge renewable energy potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iloilo City, we constructed a climate camp to show our
support for the residents of Iloilo City who are fighting to avoid
the construction of a new coal fired power plant. At events
organised with the Catholic Church and local civil society group
RISE (Responsible Illongos for Sustainable Energy) we brought home
the message that the Philippines is one of the countries most at
risk from global warming, and that burning coal is the single
biggest source of CO2 emissions and a major cause of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we moved our camp to the site of the proposed coal fired
power station to bring our message to the local communities who
will be affected by the new power plant. Tensions ran high when
workers from Panay Power Corporation acting under orders from their
management tried to dismantle the camp and cut off the activists
from the outside world.  Our response was to take our protest to
Metrobank, one of the largest banks in the Philippines and the
owners of Panay Power Corporation. This is just the beginning of a
grassroots campaign to put pressure on the financiers behind the
coal plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour concluded with visits to Antique and Boracay. In
Antique local governor Salvacion Z Perez declared her province coal
free saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earth has provided us with renewable energy. It is time to
harness this energy to generate electricity, and it is our aim to
drastically [reduce] and ultimately stop the use of fossil fuels
especially coal as source of energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boracay, we launched our "Save the climate, Save Boracay"
project, part of an initiative to enlist top island destinations in
South East Asia to reduce their carbon footprints. The people of
Boracay face inundation from rising sea levels, but are determined
to set an example to the world with their use of renewable energy
and efficient energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior carries the Quit Coal message on to Thailand

	Japanese police have arrested two Greenpeace activists for exposing a whale meat scandal involving the government-sponsored whaling programme. The two activists, Junichi Sato, 31, and Toru Suzuki, 41, are being investigated for allegedly stealing a box of whale meat which they presented as evidence.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whale campaign coordinator Junichi Sato, with the whale meat that was stolen from Japanese taxpayers, and which he provided as evidence to the government -- only to be arrested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="Box green" style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Latest updates and background on the whale meat
scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box of the most expensive cuts of whale meat had been
illicitly removed by crew of the Nisshin Maru, the whaling factory
ship, following this year's Southern Ocean whale hunt. Its contents
were marked "cardboard" and it was shipped to a private address.
Tracked by our investigators, it was intercepted and turned over to
the Public Prosecutor in Tokyo, as evidence of wide-scale
corruption at the heart of the whaling operation in the Southern
Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We requested an investigation into the scandal, and the Public
Prosecutor agreed that there was sufficient evidence of
wrongdoing.   In light of evidence that the operators of the
whaling operation were aware of the scandal and did nothing, we
asked that the investigation not focus on crew, but on the
bureaucrats who run the whaling programme at public expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE 21 June 2008&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo District Prosecutor Office announced that it has been
unable to find evidence of the embezzlement and that the
investigation into crew and whaling officials has been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this has been a difficult investigation for the
Prosecutor's Office when the level of corruption runs so deep in
the whaling industry, an industry backed by powerful forces within
the government. However, some questions remain unanswered: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Kyodo Senpaku, the company that operates the whaling ships,
was legally giving out whale meat to the crew then why did they
change their story three times in almost as many days?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why did the crew lie about the contents of the boxes containing
the meat, claiming that they contained cardboard when in fact they
were stuffed full of prime whale meat cuts worth tens of thousands
of dollars?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And why, before the scandal was exposed, did an official of the
Japanese Fisheries agency claim that whale meat was never given to
crew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25156/whale-meat-scandal-dossier.pdf" class="act"&gt;Read the full dossier of evidence, and decide for
yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 22 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; At a hearing this morning, the "Tokyo
Two" have been ordered held another ten days without charge. We are
appealing that decision tomorrow. In the meantime, our lawyer
believes that the number of people who have written demanding their
release -- nearly 50,000 at this writing -- could help their case
considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 23 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; Our appeal has been rejected, and
Junichi and Toru have been ordered to spend a further 9 days in
jail without charge. Under Japanese law, they can be held for up to
23 days without charge. More than 100,000 people have now taken our
global cyberaction demanding their release.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 27 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; Greenpeace has begun a series of
actions at Japanese embassies around the world protesting the
detention of Junichi and Toru. 170,000 people have now written to
demand their relase.  Please, if you have not already done so, take
action and encourage others to do so as well: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="video" title="video" name="video"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 10th, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junich and Toru are still in custody, 20 days after their arrest
- stay tuned for further updates. Many &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/tokyo-two-statement-of-concer/"&gt;
International Non-Governmental Organisations have signed a
Statement of Concern&lt;/a&gt; about the situation. Almost a quarter of a
million people have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;sent an email to the
Japanese government to demand their release&lt;/a&gt;. Have you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Japanese police arrested the Greenpeace activists in a
show of force, occupying the Greenpeace offices with 40 police for
more than 10 hours while they seized computers, documents, and cell
phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q5l3eaJIWXw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;&amp;amp;rel=0;fs=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme costs the Japanese taxpayer 500
million yen per year (around 4.7 million US dollars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the backlash," said Greenpeace Executive Director Jun
Hoshikawa. "We've uncovered a scandal involving powerful forces in
the Japanese government that benefit from whaling, and it's not
surprising they are striking back. What is surprising is that these
activists, who are innocent of any crime, would be arrested for
returning whale meat that was stolen from Japanese taxpayers. In
whose interest were these arrests made? Because it would appear to
us that this is an intimidation tactic by the government agencies
responsible for a scandal." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intimidation tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first news that an arrest was imminent came from Japanese
television stations. Someone leaked the information to ensure
images of Greenpeace activists under arrest appeared on news
reports in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/release-our-activists/"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2008/6/whale-arrest430.gif" width="430" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 40 police officers raided our offices and the homes of
the activists, and spent 10 hours seizing cell phones, documents,
and computers, despite the fact that we had documented every step
of how we obtained the whale meat, turned the full dossier over
with the evidence, and made ourselves available to police to help
with the investigation at any time. A simple phone call could have
brought Junichi and Toru to the police station. Instead, the
government made a public spectacle of shutting Greenpeace down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The investigation  &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our four-month undercover investigation revealed evidence of an
embezzlement ring involving crew members on board the Nisshin Maru,
who were openly taking the best cuts of whale meat during the
so-called scientific hunt, smuggling it ashore disguised as
personal luggage and then passing it to traders for illegal
sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from information given by former and current Kyodo
Senpaku employees, we documented the off-loading of smuggled whale
meat into a special truck, in full view of Kyodo Senpaku officials
and crew members when the Nisshin Maru docked on April 15th, this
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consignment was documented by our team once it left the ship
and tracked to a depot in Tokyo. One of four boxes destined for the
same private address was then intercepted in order to verify the
contents and establish the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consignment notes claimed the box contained "cardboard" but
in reality it held 23.5kg of salted 'prime' whale meat, worth up to
US$3,000. One informer told Greenpeace that dozens of crew take as
many as 20 boxes each.  One crewmember was overheard to claim he
had built a house on the proceeds from his whale-meat sales over
the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Official denials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 8th, before the scandal broke, Takahide Naruko, an
official with the Japanese FisheriesAgency, was asked by
investigators whether sailors "bring back somewhale meat as private
souvenirs," to which he replied "Of course not,"explaining that the
distribution of whale meat was only throughofficial channels, at a
price set by the Fisheries Agency to offset thecosts of the
publicly funded whaling programme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the revelations, Kyodo Senpaku, the company that runs
the whaling ship, also at first denied that any whale meat was
beinggiven away or sold outside official channels, then changed
their storyto claim that some "souvenirs" were given to crew
members.  Even so,these souvenirs were described to be a few kilos
of frozen whale meat-- very different from 23.5 kilos of prime cuts
uncoveredby Greenpeace, which the crew salt-pickle in their
cabins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 28th, an editorial in Asahi Shinbum noted
thecontradiction between claims by the Institute for Cetacean
Researchthat souvenirs were being handed out, and the claims by
Kyodo Senpakuthat they were not.  The newspaper called the
"contrived explanations"suspicious and asked for a full
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhlOxfAljAo&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is
funded by the Japanese taxpayers, including the Greenpeace
activists who have been arrested, and they have a right to know who
is profiting from their money," said Mister Hoshikawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese whaling programme has been shamed internationally
for its lack of scientific credibility, now it is being shamed at
home as well for trying to hide the corruption, and now for taking
revenge on those who have exposed it. The Greenpeace activists
should be immediately released."&lt;/p&gt;

	What's a polar bear to do?  Your ice is melting, politicians won't listen, and the government is dragging its feet about listing you as endangered...  Off to Washington, to start your own floating vigil!  Uh oh, here comes the fuzz.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist Tom Wetterer dressed in polar bear costume is arrested by outside the US Department of the Interior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, it was one of our activists in a costume - peacefully
protesting the Bush Administration's delay in issuing a final
Endangered Species Act listing for the polar bear due to global
warming. Yesterday, the activist, dressed in a polar bear suit, sat
quietly in a paddleboat in a park pond in front of the Department
of Interior. (Until the police took him to jail, where he remains
as of writing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Full steam ahead for new oil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Department of Interior is dragging their feet on
protecting polar bears, they are moving full steam ahead on plans
to drill for oil in prime polar bear habitat. New oil leases are
opening up in the Chukchi Sea and oil companies are lining up
quickly to obtain licenses to drill. A fifth of the remaining
Arctic polar bears depend on Chukchi Sea ice in their hunt for
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December of 2005, Greenpeace and two other conservation
groups sued the Bush administration when it missed its first legal
deadline to respond to the petition for an endangered species
listing. On December 27, 2006, the Service announced its proposal
to list the species as "threatened" and had one year to make a
final listing decision. The legal deadline for doing so was January
9, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="373" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XKbr-ZbRl-Y&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;border=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week it seems there is new evidence that the sea ice is
melting and that the polar bear's habitat is disappearing. The US
Geological Survey released a report this past September predicting
that if current warming projections continue, two-thirds of the
world's polar bears will likely be extinct by 2050, including all
of the polar bears in Alaska. With a timeline like that, it is hard
to understand how the polar bears aren't already protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why Listing is So Important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the polar bears were listed under the United States
Endangered Species Act - a safety net for plants and animals on the
brink of extinction - they would be granted a broad range of
protection. The protection would include a requirement that United
States federal agencies ensure that any action carried out,
authorized, or funded by the United States government will not
"jeopardize the continued existence" of polar bears, or adversely
modify their critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25221/polar-bear-doi.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/action/start/181/"&gt;Tell the US Congress not to wait for Bush - promote solutions to global warming now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Japanese whaling fleet has again defied world opinion and resumed whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The Australian Customs vessel, the Oceanic Viking, reports that the Fisheries Agency of Japan’s whaling fleet has killed at least five whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner Sakyo Noda sends a message home by holding the Japanese symbol,'nise', meaning FAKE - against the hull of the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary had remained fatality free for the whales for two
weeks due to the Esperanza chasing the factory whaling ship, the
Nissin Maru, across the Southern Ocean for 8,000 km (5,000
miles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the factory ship, the rest of the whaling fleet were
unable to operate - bringing the entire whaling programme to a
halt. During the two weeks Greenpeace spent with the fleet more
than 100 whales were saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Esperanza gave chase across the Southern Ocean, media
coverage and public discussion on the whaling issue is now reaching
unprecedented levels in Japan, where Prime Minister Fukuda has been
forced to discuss the whaling issue in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more, Japanese taxpayers must be wondering why they
arefunding this fake research operation which produces no real
science,whale meat that no one wants to eat, and brings their
country intointernational disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign to end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is now moving from the open ocean to Japan where we are
calling on Canon - a company known for its support of conservation
issues, to publicly speak out against whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already over 44,000 concerned camera owners from around the
world have responded to our call to email Fujio Mitarai, the CEO of
Canon Japan. Fujio Mitarai is also the head of the influential
Nippon Keidanren (Japanese Business Federation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/" class="act"&gt;Show you support for the whales and send your email to
Fujio Mitarai here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Global protest continues to mount with protests and vigils in front of Japanese embassies around the world and more than 180,000  190,000 200,000 letters being sent to the Japanese government demanding the release of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki -- the Tokyo Two. A network of Japanese lawyers have called the arrests a violation of human rights and a challenge to the freedom of expression in Japan.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists conduct peaceful protests at Japanese embassies around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru have been under arrest since the 20th of June,
held without charge. On Tuesday, July 1st, a hearing will be held
on whether they will be detained for a further ten days without
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru exposed a whale-meat embezzlement scandal on
May 15th by presenting a box of whale meat stolen by crew of
Japan's so-called "scientific whaling" fleet, to the Tokyo Public
Prosecutor along with a dossier documenting how they obtained it. 
The scam, in which prime cuts of whale meat are smuggled off the
ship by crewmembers and sold outside official channels, appears to
have been running for years with the full awareness of the
officials that conduct the whaling expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme is funded by taxpayers, at a cost
of 500 million yen a year (4.7 million)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosecutor's office took up an investigation, but concluded
there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges against any of
the crew or whaling officials. The only consequences in the case
were for the Greenpeace activists, who intercepted a box of meat as
evidence, and were arrested in dramatic raids on their homes and
offices, conducted by around 40 police officers in front of
television cameras.  The police seized documents, computers, cell
phones, and the Greenpeace Japan supporter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;"The response by the Japanese authorities can only
be described as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;excessive, unjust and politically motivated...Rather than trying
to silence those who point out corruption, the police should be
investigating the government officials, whaling fleet operators and
staff who smuggle whale meat from the so-called scientific
programme funded by Japanese taxpayers and sell it for profit. This
and the ongoingwhaling operation in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is where the forces of justice should be focussed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="source"&gt;Gerd Leipold, Executive Director, Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other voices in Japan are saying that the arrest was a warning
to other activist groups that as the G8 approaches, voices of
dissent in Japan will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=4853" target="_blank"&gt;Kyodo&lt;/a&gt; Reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;    While he disagrees with
Greenpeace's anti-whaling stance, journalist Takao Saito said the
way the police arrested the two men and the way they investigated
the group was heavy-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"(Greenpeace) is functioning as a
whistleblower in our society so the authorities should give them a
fair hearing to what they have to say."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WATCH, a network of laywers keeping an eye on human rights in
Japan in the run up to the G8, issued a &lt;a href="http://watch08summit.blogspot.com/2008/06/we-strongly-protest-against-detention.html"&gt;
statement&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"The arrest of the two activists is
not only a human rights violation with regard to the unjustifiable
arrest, detention and investigation, but also a challenge against
the freedom of expression. Police repression against the activists'
denunciation obstructs the legitimate activities of both Japanese
civil society and international society and is therefore
internationally unacceptable and subject to global criticism as an
affront to humanity."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon deforestation on the rise again</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazon-deforestation-increase-250108/</url><text>
	After three years of declining Amazon deforestation, rates of loss have now doubled to new record levels. Increased demand for products like soya and beef is driving the destruction.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/amazon100percent.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/amazon100percent.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            1,645 hectares of the Amazon that has been illegally deforested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures released by the Brazilian authorities, show
deforestation rates of 3235km2 from August-December 2007. However,
as the tracking system used only shows preliminary deforestation
rates, the real figure is likely to be much higher. When more
detailed satellite images are analysed they are expected to reveal
that some 7,000 km2 of rainforest has been destroyed in just 5
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last three years the Brazilian Government has been
claiming credit for decreasing rates of Amazon deforestation.
However the falling price of soya and beef meant less pressure to
clear land for cattle ranching and soya plantations. Once demand
for these products rose again, many experts, including our own
Amazon team, warned that without decisive action from the Brazilian
government increased deforestation was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon Coordinator, Paulo Adario, saw warnings go largely
unheeded: "The Brazilian government can not claim to be caught by
surprise. Greenpeace warned throughout last year that increases in
the price of soya and beef meant that unless urgent counter
measures were taken deforestation would rise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If President Lula is serious about Brazil being a world leader
in the fight against deforestation then he must implement long-term
solid measures to ensure the Amazon cannot fall victim to
deforestation as a result of rising commodity prices."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it appears the Brazilian Government missed the
chance to effectively deal with the root causes of deforestation
over the last three years. It has just release a response to the
figures, announcing a mixture of new and repackaged old protection
measures. To date the Governments track record of enforcing
protection measures in the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazoforestresettlementscam210807"&gt;
Amazon has been woeful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Eating up the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 we exposed the role of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/mcamazon-060406/"&gt;
soya in the destruction of the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with the local
community of Santarém, Brazil. in July 2006, this lead to the soy
industry announcing a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/McVictory-200706"&gt;
landmark moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on forest clearing. It is vital that the
moratorium is now extended, as it is key to protecting the
Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the soya is exported to feed cattle and chickens for
meat production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amazon - vital for biodiversity and the climate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change, causing
about 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Brazil is the
world's 4th largest contributor to global warming, mainly due to
deforestation and land clearing in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind that alarming fact lie further drivers of Amazon
destruction. The US has launched huge, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/biofuels-not-so-green-150108/"&gt;
misguided subsidies for biofuels&lt;/a&gt; from maize. This has lead US
farmers to swap soya crops for maize hence helping drive up the
global price of soya. So a false climate solution in one part of
the world could be harming the global climate by helping encourage
new Amazon deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon needs the Brazilian Government to take decisive
action on the ground to halt deforestation. Globally tropical
forests are being felled for timber, and provide land for food and
most recently to make way for biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why we aim to ensure that deforestation is included in
the next phase of the Kyoto climate agreement extending beyond
2012. The decisions that governments make in the near future are
critical for securing the financing and capacity needed by
countries to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/indonesia-forests-climate/"&gt;
safeguard their tropical forests&lt;/a&gt; and to allow them to make a
serious contribution to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Greenpeace email&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Sign up to find out how you can be part of real climate solutions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on our millions of supporters worldwide to give whatever they can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bush - Monumental failure on climate change</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bush-monumental-failure/</url><text>
	In his State of the Union address last night, Bush made it clear what we've been saying all along: He has no plan to fight global warming, and is set on leaving a legacy of neglect, obstruction and destruction when it comes to climate change. On the eve of Bush’s bogus "Major Emitters Meeting", activists have taken to the US capitol to call attention to Bush’s disastrous policies and his plan to put a wrench in the UN's process.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists project a message to US President George Bush on the Washington Monument.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Major Economies Meeting a Sham&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being booed and jeered in Bali for trying to block a
successful outcome at the UN's meeting on climate change there last
month, the Bush administration continues to push its alternative
Major Economies Meeting (aka Major Emitters Meeting) this week in
Hawaii.  The administration hopes to use this side meeting as an
opportunity to replace the Kyoto Protocol's legally binding
emissions reductions with voluntary measures only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the President was serious about leading the fight on global
warming, he would stop trying to block the success of the UN
process and commit to a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in the US. 
Instead, he continues to keep the United States standing alone as
the only industrialized country that refuses to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Monumental Disaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists gathered on the National Mall the night
before the Major Economies Meeting and turned the Washington
Monument into a memorial to Bush's failed legacy on global warming.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists projected on the Washington Monument the message,
"U.S. Global Warming Plan: Hell and High Water", accompanied by an
image depicting rising sea levels at the base. Ironically, rising
sea levels from global warming threaten the very picturesque
islands, like Bali and Hawaii, the Bush administration is fond of
visiting to talk and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why "volunteerism" is a failed policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding emission targets for industrialized countries are the
basis of any meaningful global agreement to fight climate change.
Bush just wants to cross his fingers and hope that technological
progress saves us. All he is willing to tell the world is: "Hey,
guys, we will do our best". That will not be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the German Chancellor Angela Merkel observed last year, "I
don't believe that it's enough to just agree that everyone will do
their best. I don't believe that would yield an impressive
result."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And right she is. In 2002, Bush set a voluntary target of
reducing US energy intensity 18 percent by 2012. But greenhouse gas
emissions are projected to increase by 12 percent over that period.
Voluntarism simply doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the leading Democratic Presidential candidates and two of
the three top Republican candidates support binding limits on
greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system.  US
businesses also support binding emission caps. More than two dozen
of the largest US companies - such as Ford, General Electric, GM,
Dupont, Duke Energy and Chrysler - are calling for domestic cap and
trade legislation to start cutting American emissions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush is a 'lame duck' and will be out of office when the next
global climate agreement will be made in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world can't afford falling for Bush's Hawaii distraction.
Countries attending the meeting should resist Bush's ploy and
commit to real climate action now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries participating in Bush's meeting are: Japan,
France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, China, Canada, India,
Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesian, and
South Africa.  While the countries most at risk from impacts of
climate change - such as small island developing states like Tuvalu
- are not even invited to be at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Does Canon support shooting whales?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/canon-shooting-whales-240108/</url><text>
	Having saved over 100 whales by pursuing the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship for over 5,000 miles,keeping it and the rest of the fleet out of action for 14 days, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza has run low on fuel and must return to port. Yet, as our ship heads to Hobart, Australia, the campaign to save the whales is far from over. We're focused on shooting whales... with cameras. But we were surprised to learn that Canon, the world's number one digital camera producer, isn't willing to condemn using harpoons -- despite their high-profile advertising and sponsorship programmes dedicated to wildlife and endangered species.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/Shoot-whales-with-a-CANON.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/Shoot-whales-with-a-CANON.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If you want to shoot a whale - use a CANON.…But only if Canon tells the whalers to lose the harpoons
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wrote to Canon headquarters in Japan asking their CEO to
speak out against Japan's whaling programme. But Canon declined to
take a stand against the killing of thousands of whales in the
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  Is this really wildlife as Canon
sees it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, Canon cameras shoot whales on whale-watching
expeditions but in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, many whales
are shot instead with exploding harpoons. Thousands of whales,
including endangered fin whales, have been killed here under the
guise of "scientific research" ever since the global moratorium on
whaling came into force in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale meat from the hunt is sold to a tiny minority of Japanese
people who eat whale meat -- the rest is turned into dog food or
added to the stockpile of around 4,000 tonnes of unsold meat.  &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Whales can be studied without killing them&lt;/a&gt;: the cloak of
"science" merely allows a few Japanese bureaucrats to maintain an
unprofitable whale meat industry at the expense of Japanese
taxpayers. Yet this scandal continues because there is not enough
domestic pressure in Japan to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Take Action: Ask the CEO of Canon
Japan to defend whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Fujio Mitarai, the CEO of Canon Japan, is a businessman,
a taxpayer, and the leader of a company that endorses wildlife
conservation. He is also the head of the Nippon Keidanren (Japanese
Business Federation). This is the highest position to which a CEO
can aspire in the Japanese business world and it means having the
ear of the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His voice could help put an end to a decades-old scientific hoax
and subsidy scandal, and add weight to Canon's claims to
environmental concern by actually saving the whales that advertise
Canon cameras. So we asked him to speak out against whaling within
Japanese society by signing the following statement to clarify
Canon's position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Canon is committed to building a better world for future
generations, and does not support the hunting of endangered or
threatened species with anything other than a camera. Canon
believes the lethal whaling research programme in the Southern
Ocean should be ended, and replaced with a non-lethal research
programme."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Canon has so far refused our request, saying "We
fully recognise the importance of protecting endangered wildlife.
We have continuously put our advertisements featuring "endangered
species" in National Geographic since 1981."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, their letter concluded,"scientific opinion about
research whaling varies... we will not signthe statement you have
sent us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25228/shotby-harpoon.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the whales need a powerful domestic ally in Japan -- so now
we're asking our supporters (and especially Canon customers) to
urge him to reconsider, and express his disapproval of lethal
research whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan wants to do research, it can do so with cameras and
other non-lethal means - just as we have been doing through our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Great Whale Trail project&lt;/a&gt;, which uses satellite tracking, photo
identification and skin biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve our independence, we do not accept corporate
donations. Greenpeace is not sponsored by Canon, never has been,
and never will be.  We do use Canon cameras - thereare nine of them
aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza at the moment, one of them in
thehands of Leandra, our on-board scientist doing non-lethal
research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All were professional or personal purchases. We are not calling
for a boycott on Canon products -- they are not directly involved
in whaling -- we are challenging Canon to match word to deed, and
to take action for the whales, in the same way we seek to inspire
individuals to take action for a better world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Canon?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canon has built a great deal of its brand's reputation for
environmental concern through their sponsorship of environmental
causes, including the conservation of endangered species.  Canon
runs a popular series of ads in National Geographic Magazine
entitled  "Wildlife as Canon sees it" and supports wildlife
advocacy groups around the world with donations, equipment, and
expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that when a corporation draws income and brand value
from association with environmental causes, they have a
responsibility to speak out on those issues.  We trust that most of
the good folks at Canon, as one of the world's premier "wildlife
brands," share our concern that wildlife in general, and whales in
particular, should not die unnecessarily  for "science." &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canon &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/environment/eco2007e/p67.html"&gt;says on
its website&lt;/a&gt;that it wants to "hand over a beautiful Earth for
future generations".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25228/shot-with-a-canon.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corporation which paints itself as a defender of wildlifeand
one concerned about endangered species and the natural world
oughtto do more than express those values in images,
advertisements, andsponsorships: they need to use their immense
power to speak out and actfor a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Every day,supporters ask: Why no boycott?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace does notendorse a general boycott of Japanese
products. We know that themajority of Japanese people do not
actually support whaling, and we areanti-whaling, not
anti-Japanese.  We believe such a boycottwould be difficult to
focus, harm the wrong people, and be ineffectivein stopping
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width: 223px; float: left; margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 4px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_orig/international/photosvideos/photos/CanonAd-NationalG.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_orig/international/photosvideos/photos/CanonAd-NationalG.jpg','popup','width=747,height=1175,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0');return false"&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;Canon advertisement in National
Geographic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet wealso know there are deep sentiments among our supporters
to participatein such a boycott - they write to us literally every
day during thewhaling season either announcing they have launched
their own boycottor wanting to know why Greenpeace doesn't do the
same.  Evenin the absence of an organised boycott, whaling harms
Japan's imagewith potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's anexample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we heard from awoman who wrote to Toyota in
her home country, New Zealand, to say shewas not going to replace
her Prius with a new one, because Toyota, as aJapanese car company,
had an implicit association with Japan's whalingprogramme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota New Zealand wrote back to her to say"Please be assured
that Toyota New Zealand and Toyota Motor CorporationJapan do not
condone whaling for commercial, scientific or researchpurposes." 
While Toyota Japan later distanced themselves fromthis position, it
demonstrates how much of a liability whaling can befor Japanese
corporations operating in the West.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we looked at what other Japanesecorporations ought to be
enlisted to  speak out domesticallyagainst whaling, Canon leapt out
as an obviouschoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;My family and I love canon cameras- they are all we've ever owned, and we will love them even more if you prove to the world that Canon is committed to building a better world for future generations, and does not support the hunting of endangered or threatened species with anything other than a camera. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The earth would be incredibly less beautiful without whales.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/01/canon_can_save_whales.html"&gt;
Read more letters that have already been sent to Canon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whaling: more troublethan it's worth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Japanese officials are already speaking out about whaling
being a diplomatic liability.The Japanese decision, since put on
hold, to add humpback whales to thelist of species targeted in the
whale hunt led to formal complaintsfrom several of Japan's
allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times quoted oneofficial, who asked to remain
anonymous, as saying "[Whaling] is doingno good for Japanese
diplomacy. Many people are saying Japan is notbalancing its
interests, with a vocal minority dictating a course thatrisks some
of our most cherishedrelationships."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As head of the JapaneseBusiness Federation, Mister Mitarai has a
responsibility not just forCanon's own welfare, but also for the
collective well-being of Japanesebusinesses at home and abroad --
where whaling is a liability forJapanese brands and
theirprofitability.&lt;/p&gt;

Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary youcan write to him by clicking on

	Yesterday, after 11 days of preventing the Japanese whaling fleet from killing whales, activists from the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, temporarily blocked the fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru from being illegally refueled in Antarctic waters.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace inflatable boat tries to prevent Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru from refueling from the supply vessel Oriental Bluebird in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a dramatic peaceful protest, two of our activists
drove an inflatable boat between the factory ship and the refueling
vessel, as the two massive ships began moving closer together in
preparation for refueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace inflatables were launched while members of the
Esperanza's crew warned the Japanese vessels, which were still
about a mile apart, that our boat and activists were beside the
refueling vessel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Bluebird"&gt;Oriental
Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, to oppose the illegal refueling within the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty"&gt;Antarctic
Treaty area&lt;/a&gt;. But the two ships continued to close in on each
other trapping one of our inflatables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Before inflatables were launched the
crew of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza radioed the Panamanian
flagged Oriental Bluebird, in Japanese, Spanish and English, with a
statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Oriental Bluebird must leave Antarctic waters immediately:
your presence here is unwanted and a threat to the pristine
Antarctic environment which has been declared a particularly
sensitive sea area by the International Maritime Organisation and a
'natural reserve, devoted to peace and science' by the &lt;a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/environmental_issues/environmental_protocol.php"&gt;
Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt;… Japan, as a
party to the Treaty, must comply with the letter and the spirit of
the Treaty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about half an hour our inflatable - 8 meters long between
vessels of around 130 and 160 meters length - prevented the two
ships from starting to refuel. Eventually the inflatable was forced
out, with our driver narrowly avoiding getting caught by a
cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ships began exchanging their goods: fuel for the Nisshin
Maru to continue hunting whales, and the boxed "scientific results"
(whale meat) for the Oriental Bluebird to take back to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists continued to document the refueling and whale meat
transfer from inflatables. As they were doing so, the Japanese
hunter vessels spent more than an hour performing dangerous
maneuvers, driving directly towards our inflatables in order to
push them away from the Nisshin Maru and Oriental Bluebird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/the_oceanic_viking_arrives_in.html"&gt;
At this point, the Australian coastguard ship, the Oceanic Viking
appeared on the horizon.&lt;/a&gt; Their arrival had an immediate impact
on the activities. The hunter vessels slowed down and increased
their distance to the factory ships and as the Oceanic Viking came
closer they also turned off their hoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oceanic Viking launched two inflatables to document the
whaling fleet, free from the freezing water canon or dangerous
maneuvers of hunter ships. As our activists returned to the
Esperanza they radioed the Australian crew to request that the
Australian Government investigate the illegal refueling within
Antarctic waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Oriental Bluebird is an integral part of the
whaling fleet. But it does not having any permit from the
Panamanian Government as required by the International Whaling
Commission. Japan is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, which is
designed to ensure protection of the Antarctic environment. But the
whaling fleet consistently fails to submit the required
environmental impact assessments to the Antarctic Treaty
Secretariat. The Oriental Bluebird also lacks this documentation.
Ironically, Panama takes a position in defense of whales, at the
International Whaling Commission and elsewhere and yet they
participate in whaling by allowing the Oriental Bluebird to operate
under their flag. Greenpeace is urging Panama to de-flag the
Oriental Bluebird, or order it stop supporting the needless
slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Japanese Fisheries Agency said at a press briefing
that they have not resumed whaling because the Esperanza is with
them. Greenpeace activists are in the Southern Ocean to peacefully
stop the hunt and that is what they have done. But it is not enough
to stop whaling only when the world's eyes are on the fleet and the
Esperanza is on its tail. Japan must call an end to this whaling
season now and make it the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government has come under increasing pressure over
their whaling programme and yesterday that pressure increased after
Greenpeace Japan Whales Project Leader Junichi Sato wrote an open
letter to Japanese business leaders warning of the negative impact
that whaling is having on the country's reputation
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already the New Zealand division of Toyota has condemned whaling
and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even the former whaling company Nissui, has acknowledged that
whaling is bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green" style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The letter
states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'By hunting nearly 1,000 whales including endangered fin whales,
byusing tax payers' money, under the name of "research" in
aninternationally recognized whale sanctuary, the Japanese
government iscreating huge environmental, economic, and diplomatic
friction, thenegative impact of which many professionals in the
economic andfinancial world in Japan have underestimated.  As
Nippon Suisan Kaisha,Ltd. (Nissui), one of the major ex-whaling
companies, said, "Involvementin whaling is a business risk."
Whaling creates a negative image to theworld for Japanese companies
and the country itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action: Stop the new whaling ship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/new-whaling-ship-121207#letter"&gt;If Japan succeeds in plans to build a new whaling factory ship, whaling could continue for decades.  Tell the Japanese Prime Minister that building the new factory ship is a bad idea. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help raise money to save whales&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org/visitor/index.php?event_id=main"&gt;Create your own Whale Defenders page; get your friends and family to help you defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace ship Esperanza continues to prevent whaling as we shadow the Japanese fleet's factory ship, Nisshin Maru. Our crew today sent a message, direct from the Southern Ocean, linking the scandal of whaling to a host of other scandals plaguing the government in Tokyo.

            Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner Sakyo Noda sends a message home by holding the Japanese symbol,'nise', meaning FAKE - against the hull of the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On board an inflatable running parallel to the giant factory
ship, Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2007/12/sakyo_campaigner.html"&gt;
Sakyo Noda&lt;/a&gt; held the Japanese &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji"&gt;kanji&lt;/a&gt; symbol &lt;span style="font-size: 150%"&gt;偽&lt;/span&gt; ("nise"), meaning "fake", next to
the word "RESEARCH" which has been painted by the Japanese
Fisheries Agency on the Nishim Maru's hull. Reflecting a growing
disquiet in Japanese society, &lt;span style="font-size: 150%"&gt;偽&lt;/span&gt; was voted the &lt;a href="http://no-sword.jp/blog/2007/12/2008_kanji_of_the_year.html"&gt;best
kanji symbol of the year&lt;/a&gt; for 2008. Its choice reflects recent
food mislabeling scandals, problems over political funds and faulty
pension records. Greenpeace Japan is now using it to show that the
use of taxpayers money to fund "scientific" whaling which yields no
useful science is yet another government scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vDlRgplqHA&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to self-censorship, until recently the whaling issue has not
been given much attention in the Japanese news media. Being against
whaling was thought to be against Japanese culture. This created a
"whalers' sanctuary" inside Japanese society that protected a small
number of bureaucrats, whalers and politicians who have vested
interests in whaling -- all at the expense of the taxpayer. But
finally things are changing, as &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23024633-5000117,00.html"&gt;
the truth is beginning to hit home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, one of Japan's leading newspapers, the &lt;a href="http://www.asahi.com/"&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;, called into
question the validity of the whaling programme, by asking "Why is
the Japanese government so insistent on engaging in whaling?". The
report cited concerns about the use of taxpayers' money, dubious
science, the lack of interest from the fishing industry in
supporting the whaling programme and the fact that former employees
of the Japanese government Fisheries Agency were "parachuted" into
key (and well paid) roles in the supposedly independent Institute
of Cetacean Research - the agency which commissions the whaling
fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years the Japan Fisheries Agency has claimed that
whaling is integral to Japanese culture. Yet when shown pictures of
modern whaling in the Southern Ocean, complete with factory ships
and grenade-tipped harpoons, Japanese people don't recognise
anything traditional about it.  In fact, modern whaling methods
were introduced by the US after World War II as a means of
addressing food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a survey conducted by the Nippon Research Centre, in
2006, showed that  over 95 percent of the public had never or very
rarely eaten whale meat. It also found that 90 percent of Japanese
people had no idea their government hunted whales in the Southern
Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and once they were aware of it, 69 percent
disagreed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2006/12/stockpiles_of_whalemeat_are_in.html"&gt;
Japan has over 4000 tonnes of frozen whale meat in storage&lt;/a&gt;, and
despite the government's attempts to make eating it part of
Japanese culture, the public just aren't interested. Instead, there
is a growing interest in the campaign to end whaling in the
Southern Ocean. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/"&gt;TheGreenpeace Japan website&lt;/a&gt;
has been attracting an extraordinaryincrease in traffic. Last week
the number of page views jumped from10,000 a day to 10,000 in one
hour. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/fake-science-exposed180108/Whaling-receives-criticism200108"&gt;
Visitors to the web site are also writing letters to Japanese
governmentministers asking them to stop squandering tax payers
money on whaling, via an online petition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real beneficiaries of Japanese whaling are a few bureaucrats
who maintain the industry on subsidies to cover shrinking whalemeat
sales, while damaging Japan's reputation and profitability abroad. 
It's time for the taxpayers, the media,  and the business community
of Japan to call for an end to this scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action: Stop the new whaling ship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/new-whaling-ship-121207#letter"&gt;If Japan succeeds in plans to build a new whaling factory ship, whaling could continue for decades.  Tell the Japanese Prime Minister that building the new factory ship is a bad idea. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help raise money to save whales&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org/visitor/index.php?event_id=main"&gt;Create your own Whale Defenders page; get your friends and family to help you defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-deforestation-agreement/"&gt; The plan&lt;/a&gt;, published yesterday, sets out specific targets that could see deforestation drop gradually over the next seven years, pushing for a cut of 25 percent in the first year compared to figures for 2005/6. It's thinking on a massive scale, but we believe it can be done - with deforestation rates already falling and with a concerted effort it really could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the proposal contains a few key elements, none of which are particularly radical but together with tough reduction targets add up to a powerful package. One is to create financial incentives that promote forest protection rather than forest destruction, so everyone is encouraged to make use of the forest in a truly responsible manner than has been the case up until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object id="amazonfires-slideshow" width="430" height="311" data="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="data" value="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf"&gt;
&lt;param name="name" value="amazonfires-slideshow"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another central plank of the proposal is to beef up the forest protection agencies so there is a hugely increased presence of state and government officials. With increased resources, they'll be able to monitor, control and inspect commercial activities properly to prevent illegal logging and land clearance for farming. One of the major challenges is to ensure that zero deforestation is achieved while still guaranteeing the social-rights of indigenous and local communities who live in and around the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is going to be possible without full involvement from the government and companies, but at least they're listening. Present at the launch in Brasilia today were Minister of Environment Marina Silva and the governors of several Amazon states, including Blario Maggi. As well as being governor of Mato Grosso, he is also the head of Grupo Amaggi, a major soya exporter and signatory too the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/mcvictory"&gt;two-year soya moratorium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's a price tag for all this - an estimated one billion reais (over 384 million euros). Weighed against the value of the rain forest in terms of biodiversity and the livelihoods of the people who depend on it, it looks like small change, particularly when it includes international contributions. Because, given the rainforest's role in moderating climate change, it's something we all have an interest in preserving: up to one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions are down to deforestation, making Brazil the fourth largest polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol begin this December in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, and we want to see deforestation included in the discussions. If that happens, responsibility for forest protection won't fall just on forest nations, and rich countries will need to contribute as well. For daring zero deforestation proposals like this one to work, international co-operation is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=amz-agreement"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The EU is pushing ahead with measures to boost adoption of renewable energy and cut carbon emissions. Although they still don't go far enough, they are a step in the right direction.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace installs solar panels on a school.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have been telling politicians all along that only
renewable technologies such as wind and solar power, alongside
improving energy efficiency, are the only real solution to climate
change. The penny dropped last year, when the EU announced that by
2020, a fifth of all energy would come from renewable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments were quick to show their green credentials by
signing up but now we want to see action to make sure the target is
achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large energy companies lobbied hard to introduce a virtual
trading system for renewable energy that would undermine the broad
development of renewable energy technologies. Luckily these efforts
to derail effective renewables support failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the European Commission has published targets setting out
the amount of renewable energy each country must generate to ensure
that the EU goal is met. The push on renewables is just one part of
a wider package to tackle climate change. They have also released a
breakdown of how much each country needs to cut their carbon
emissions by to make good the EU's promise to achieve a 20 percent
cut by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 per cent carbon emissions reductions are
needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But whilst these measures show that the EU is
thinking along the right lines, the targets themselves simply
aren't ambitious enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU targets fall short of what is needed to ensure that
global warming is kept below 2 degrees Celsius, what scientists
agree would be the tipping point for Earth's climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it isn't just environmental organisations that are saying
this. Scientists agree that a 20 percent cut in emissions just
isn't enough, and the European Commission themselves have openly
admitted that it falls short of what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the EU really wants to show leadership on climate change they
need to set realistic targets to cut emissions - and that means a
30 percent reduction by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU carbon credits system still flawed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climate proposals also set out new rules for emissions
trading. The EU set up the Emissions Trading Scheme in 2005 to
tackle emissions from industry. It means that companies have to
either reduce their emissions or buy carbon credits from other
companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has suggested ways to fix some major flaws in the
existing scheme, but again they've caved into industry pressure and
pulled back from making the scheme as effective as it needs to
be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies will still be given at least 40 percent of the carbon
permits that are available for free in 2013. This is no good. If
the scheme is to have any real teeth we need to make sure that the
polluter pays and that the real cost of carbon is accurately
reflected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU's climate package is a good start but if Europe really is
to show bold leadership on climate change they need to go much
further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Greenpeace email&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Sign up to find out how you can be part of real climate solutions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations.

	It seems you can't turn anywhere at a motor show these days without numerous manufacturers green claims competing for attention. But take a peek under the green hood and the industry has a huge, dirty, lobbying engine still stuck in reverse.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists displayed banners depicting car manufacturers as the wooden puppet Pinocchio.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To highlight how many of these green claims are just PR we
unfurled a banner of Pinocchio in front of the European car show in
Brussels. "Just as Pinocchio couldn't be a real boy till he stopped
telling lies, the car makers will never be green until they stop
showing off a green image at car shows while filling the roads with
ever heavier and more powerful gas guzzlers," said Helen Perivier,
Greenpeace International campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperate to protect their market for heavier and more powerful
cars, manufacturers last month succeeded in weakening an European
Union (EU) proposal to set mandatory carbon dioxide emissions
standards for their fleets sold in Europe and push for further
concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the car industry appears to fear most is exactly what we
need to tackle cars contribution to global warming - tough, legally
binding regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1996, when first threatened by European fuel efficiency
regulations, manufacturers promised they could make their cars more
efficient themselves. The much abused "please no rules, we promise
to be good" approach that is perfect for companies looking to
continue business as usual but almost always useless for protecting
the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, after the eight years car manufacturers had to
comply with previous voluntary targets the majority had failed
miserably to meet them. Then the EU Commission proposed to get
tough again in 2006 with new strict legally binding rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather then admit that tough rules were needed for the good of
the planet the car industry ramped up it formidable, multi-million
dollar lobby machine. European car manufactures (supported by US
car firms, like General Motors and Ford) have lobbied successfully
to weaken the proposed regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Profits over Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car industry is desperate to protect one of its most
profitable sectors - big heavy cars, often aimed at the top end of
the market. So far they have succeeded in weakening the EU proposal
to set mandatory carbon dioxide emissions standards for their
fleets sold in Europe and push for further concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that technologies exist to make cars more
efficient, the car makers continue to put profit well ahead their
responsibility to confront climate change when it really
matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the EU rules are to have any teeth to effectively control
carbon dioxide emissions they must be strengthened to including a
120g CO2/km standard as a fleet average for 2012; and a longer-term
target of 80g CO2/km by 2020; base emission standards on a car's
size and not its weight; and set effective penalties to ensure car
manufacturers respect the new standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the final law doesn't have teeth, no amount of green
marketing will be able to hide that fact that it was car makers who
drove a massively heavy and expensive wrecking ball through the
EU's good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/merkel-cars-letter/"&gt;Please write to the Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, today asking her to support strong emissions standards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations.

	Every Macworld brings something new to Mac lovers. This year, Steve Jobs pulled out an interoffice envelope, opened the flap and revealed the new “MacBook Air” – the thinnest notebook computer on the planet. For us though the highlight of the show, was Steve talking about the environment in his keynote speech for the first time. It’s a big step for Steve and we would like to congratulate all the Apple fans who helped us with our greenmyapple campaign… You made this happen!
&lt;div&gt;

            Screenshot from the Steve Jobs' keynote speech giving the environment a new debut in Apple policy, January 2008.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May, Steve got us excited when he finally answered the
50.000 mac fans who wrote to him and announced that Apple would be
going green. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/tasty-apple-news-020507/"&gt;
Steve's commitment&lt;/a&gt; was not everything we asked for but it did
include a commitment to the phase out of the toxic chemicals &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#bfr"&gt;
Brominated Fire Retardants&lt;/a&gt; (BFRs) and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#pvc"&gt;
Polyvinyl Chloride&lt;/a&gt; (PVC) by the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June last year Apple launched the iPhone. We had hoped that
the iPhone would be Apples' first step towards a green product but
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/iPhone-test-hazardous-toxic-chemicals151007"&gt;
Steve missed the call&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems that Steve has come back
with a winner at this years' Mac World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time Steve is on the right path for a green Apple. The
MacBook Air is a strong entry in the race to build a green PC. As a
mercury and arsenic free laptop it exceeds European Standards (&lt;a href="http://www.rohs.eu/english/index.html"&gt;RoHS directive&lt;/a&gt;
exemptions) and raises the bar for the rest of the industry. The
BFR and PVC free printed wiring on the motherboard is a big step
forward, but not a first. Sony achieved that last November with the
Vaio notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MacBook Air has less PVC and BFRs than other Mac computers,
but it is not entirely free from those hazardous chemicals. Had it
been it would have made Apple an ecological leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their product design on the right track Apple needs to make
environmental leadership the theme of all its products - old and
new. That means green design as standard right through the product
line and a real global commitment to take back and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can almost taste that Green Apple, unfortunately it's not
ripe yet.&lt;/p&gt;

	Europe stands on the verge of a great opportunity. Its fleet of power stations, built thirty years ago is reaching the end of its life. With climate change an undeniable threat, this is a once in a lifetime chance to turn our back on fossil fuels and embrace the energy revolution. A revolution which could bring greenhouse gas emissions under control, and help prevent catastrophic climate change.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists plant 2,008 trees on the construction site of the new E.ON coal power plant in Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam. Ironically today is the, "national day for planting a tree", sponsored by E.ON.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shame then that the power companies who could do most to
support that shift are doing their best to secure another thirty
years of business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Netherlands - trees against coal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, German power company E.ON plan to build a
new coal fired power station, another four are also planned by
other utilities. Last week Greenpeace won an injunction halting the
construction from going ahead because E.ON does not have an
operating licence for the plant, only a construction permit. Our
lawsuit secures a window of opportunity to prevent the construction
from going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seizing the opportunity, today, while E.ON has been seeking to
improve its image by sponsoring "national tree day", around 100
Greenpeace activists celebrated the event by planting thousands of
trees on the proposed site of the company's new power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Germany - giant metal dinosaur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/vattenfall-hq-protest"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25205/vattenfall-hq-protest.jpg" border="0" height="323" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, Vattenfall are another company building new coal
fired power plants. Once again, Greenpeace is leading the fight to
stop them. The three new plants proposed by Vattenfall would pump
out some 18.2 million tonnes of carbon per year. Coal power
stations should go the way of the dinosaurs, and Greenpeace made
that point by delivering a 5-meter tall dinosaur and three tonnes
of coal to Vattenfalls' headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Vattenfall plant at Moorburg the subject of discussions
between Germany's Christian Democrats and Greens, as they seek to
form a new provincial government, there is a real chance to do the
right thing and consign this power plant to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Better ideas on offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal companies try to disguise their filthy investments by
talking up the prospect of implementing Carbon Capture and Storage
(&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/CCS-briefing"&gt;
CCS&lt;/a&gt;) technology. Just one of the problems? We need carbon
reductions now, but Vattenfall say their first 'commercial concept'
will be ready between 2015 and 2020  - too late to make a
difference, even it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe doesn't face up to the coal industry it will have to
face up to the consequences of climate change. Fortunately there is
an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs an Energy Revolution.  That means investment in
clean energy and enhanced energy efficiency measures. Investing in
renewable energy like wind energy and solar power, or in combined
heat and power plants - which take the excess heat created by
electricity generation and make it available for heating rather
than letting it dissipate into the atmosphere - can deliver the CO2

	In an historic move, the Romanian Government today announced it will ban genetically engineered (GE) maize and embrace organic agriculture. The move is particularly significant as GE maize is the only commercially cultivated GE crop permitted in Europe.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monsanto's GMO corn threatens biodiversity.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister of Environment and Durable Development Mr Attila
Korodi's announcement banning Monsanto's GE maize MON 810, makes
Europe's largest per hectare maize producer GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My ministry is in possession of new scientific studies showing
that GE is not safe for human health or the environment," Korodi
said. "These are the same studies that have recently been used by
other European Union Member States such as France, Hungary, Austria
and Greece to justify the banning of Monsanto's GE maize MON
810...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We expect [the ban] to come into force around 15 April. Until
that time, we demand that Romanian farmers do not plant MON 810
seeds. The future of Romania is organic," he declared at an event
organised by Greenpeace, Slow Food and the Organic Farmers
Organisation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania cultivates about 3 million hectares of maize annually,
losing GE companies an important market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government's decision makes Romania the seventh of Europe's
leading maize producers to ban the growing of Monsanto's GE maize,
following France, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Greece and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/releases/seralini_study_MON863"&gt;
studies&lt;/a&gt; which have been significant in European governments'
decision to reject GE have shown MON 810 maize is harmful to
wildlife, soil and human health. Its inbuilt toxin, which is
designed to kill the cornborer, a pest considered insignificant in
Romania and other parts of Europe, seeps into soil harming animals
critical to soil health, such as earthworms, and other wildlife
including butterflies, ants and spiders. Proof of its safety for
human and animal health are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Romania's GE ban marks a seismic change. It sends a critical
message that this dangerous technology will not be tolerated. It is
vital the European Commission protects all of Europe's farmers,
consumers and environment by introducing an EU-wide ban against GE
cultivation," Geert Ritsema, Greenpeace International GE campaign
coordinator said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's 10-year licence, granted by the European Commission
to grow MON 810 throughout the EU, comes up for renewal later this
year. This provides an important opportunity for the Commission and
European Union (EU) Member States to reject GE once and for
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-eu-unit/press-centre/press-releases2/Dimas-call-for-maize-ban-071025"&gt;
Stavros Dimas&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commissioner for the Environment,
raised concerns over the safety of GE cultivation. But to date his
proposal to ban the growing of two GE maize varieties has been
blocked by President of the European Commission Manuel Barroso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Romanian people overwhelmingly reject this unsafe,
unnecessary and unsustainable technology," said Gabriel Paun, GE
Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace Romania. In 2007, a
Greenpeace-commissioned opinion poll conducted by Mercury Research
showed 67 percent of Romanians do not want to eat GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from safety concerns, GE also poses contamination threat
to natural crops. There have been 216 contamination events in 57
countries since GE crops were first grown commercially on a large
scale in 1996, as Greenpeace and GeneWatch UK's latest &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/gm-contamination-register-2007/"&gt;
GM Contamination Register Report&lt;/a&gt; shows.   Greenpeace is calling
for an international standard to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/gm-ge-contamination-report290208/"&gt;
hold biotech companies to account&lt;/a&gt; for the damage and financial
losses they cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a postcard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/solidarity-send-commissioner"&gt;Send EU Environment Commissioner Dimas a postcard encouraging him to keep standing up for life, biodiversity, health, beauty of nature -- and against reckless industry giants aiming for nothing else than control of the world's food and biodiversity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Japanese whalers have announced that they are struggling to harpoon their quota this year.  As the season draws to a close, they have caught less than half the 985 whales they targeted.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace dogged the whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean, shutting down the whalers for longer than ever before.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping the whaling fleet's factory ship on the run in
January our non-violent protests were vital in frustrating the
Japanese Fisheries Agency's plans, as the whalers tried to avoid
public scrutiny by not killing whales in our presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the support of millions of people like you we could not
have sent our ship, the Esperanza, to the Southern Ocean, or
generated enough controversy to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
cause Japan to call off their humpback hunt before it had even
started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only a couple of weeks left in the hunting season, and
by their own admission the owners of the whaling ships will not be
off-loading anything like the planned 1,000 whales worth of boxed
and frozen whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whale meat from the start of the hunt is due to arrive
back in Japan in the next few days - destined to sit in warehouse
stockpiles as potential whale meat buyers in Japan are themselves
becoming a vanishing species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in January, as well as shutting down the whale operations
for longer than ever before,  we peacefully disrupted the refueling
of the Japanese whaling fleet by the tanker Oriental Bluebird.
Following the refueling, huge amounts of whale meat were
transferred to the Oriental Bluebird for transit back to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird doesn't have a permit as part of Japan's
research whaling fleet, and is flagged as a Panamanian vessel. Both
Panama and Japan have signed the international Convention on the
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which prohibits commercial
trade in species named on its Appendix 1 list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minke whale is an Appendix 1 species, and while Japan has
filed for an exception to the regulations, Panama has not. The meat
now steaming towards Japan all boxed up and ready for sale has,
according to law, been exported to Panamanian territory -- and the
Greenpeace ship Esperanza has photos to document that. Any
offloading of the whale meat in Japan could constitute a violation
of the CITES convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the whale meat is offloaded, we'll be ashore to voice
the opposition of whale defenders around the world. Greenpeace
Japan has been urging supermarkets and restaurants not to offer
whale meat. Three of the top five supermarkets chains have
responding positively. 'Watami', a famous pub chain, with over 600
restaurants all over Japan, has also confirmed that whale is off
the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer and fewer people in Japan are eating whale meat, leading
to declining demand and an unsold stockpile of nearly 4,000 tonnes
of whale meat. In a desperate attempt by the bureaucrats of the
Japanese Fisheries Agency to reverse the trend and create
artificial support for their unpopular product, the whale meat has
been subsidised, pushed into school lunches and even used as dog
food. A company charged with marketing the meat has for two years
running failed to turn a profit, and the whalers this year had to
reorganise payment of an interest-free government loan, as they've
been unable to meet their sales targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial whaling has no future -- whether it's disguised as
scientific research or not.  In Norway, the number one buyer of
whale meat &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/03/will_nobody_buy_their_whale_me.html"&gt;
announced that they're getting out of the whale meat business&lt;/a&gt;.
In Iceland, the Minister of Fisheries &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/08/iceland_to_stop_whaling.html"&gt;
announced last year that no quota was being set&lt;/a&gt; because there
was no market for the whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With steady pressure, we can ensure that whaling is consigned to
the history books forever, and that in future whales are shot by
the cameras of whale watchers, rather than the harpoons of
so-called researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

	We've tracked a shipment of suspect wood from the Amazon to France on board the cargo ship Galina III. Some hours ago our activists climbed on the ship. Once our activists were onboard, the ship missed its chance to go into port. Its next chance is at dawn with the new tide, but for now it is headed back out to sea with our activists occupying its cranes. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists board a cargo ship entering the port of Caen, France. The ship is loaded with timber  sourced from companies with links to illegal logging operations in the Amazon. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team in Brazil, and here in Europe, put months of
surveillance and research into the companies behind this shipment
who engage in illegal logging and ancient forest destruction.  Now
we're calling them out in public, to get tougher laws against
people like them. Sixty to eighty percent of timber from the Amazon
is illegally logged - with Europe a major buyer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 3px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Victory update (7pm local time, 18 March):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're happy to say that the Frenchgovernment has promised to
support new European Union wide laws regulatingtimber imports.
After a 24-hour occupation, our activists have left the
ship'scranes and ended the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Action details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two fast boats from our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, pulled up to
the 16,000 tonne Galina roughly five kilometres (3 miles) from
port. Five activists managed to clamber onboard before the cargo
ship's crew threw the ladder off. After reassuring the Galina's
crew about their peaceful intentions, some of the activists
occupied the ship's cranes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists onboard the Galina are from the UK, Germany, Italy
and Chile. The temperature at sea is about four degrees Celsius
(39&amp;amp;deg; F).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Illegal logging exposed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace Amazon campaigner, Marcelo
Marquesini:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal logging is fuelling the destruction of the Amazon
rainforest and this in turn is driving global climate change,
harming biodiversity and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is worse is that the EU is complicit in this destruction
being the world's leading importer of Brazilian Amazonian timber.
Because the EU doesn't verify that timber comes from legal sources,
the door is left wide open for rogue companies to flood the EU
market with illegal timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's action came on the back of a new Greenpeace report,
'Future for Forests', uncovering the illegal timber trade from the
Amazon into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as destroying large areas of tropical forest, illegal
logging encourages land grabbing by farmers and speculators, and
fuels corruption and violence. As the loggers move on in their
search for high value timber, they leave behind a network of roads
opening up previously inaccessible parts of the rainforest. Farmers
and land grabbers move in to take advantage - burning the remaining
trees to clear the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amazon and climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just the Amazon forest at stake; it's also our shared
climate. Tropical deforestation is responsible for about one-fifth
of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire
transport sector. Last month, the Brazilian government admitted
that the rate of deforestation is speeding up rather than slowing
down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is the main source of Brazil's greenhouse gas
emissions, making it the most important contributing factor to the
country's position as the world's fourth-largest climate
polluter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In depth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/future-for-forests/"&gt;In depth reading: Our new report, "A Future for Forests", about the Amazon, deforestation and the European Union.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Greenpeace, the Center for Biological Diversity and the NRDC have filed a lawsuit against the Bush Administration for missing its legal deadline to issue a final decision on whether the polar bear should be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to global warming. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/1/polar-bears.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/1/polar-bears.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The polar bear should be immediately listed as a 'threatened' species, due to the meltdown of its sea-ice habitat caused by global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks a court order to compel the administration to
issue the final decision immediately. Greenpeace activists returned
to the US Department of Interior yesterday, designating the
building as a 'critical habitat for oil lobbyists'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the repeated delays and deception with the listing
process, the Department of Interior has used the time to press
ahead with plans to lease 29 million acres of prime polar bear
habitat for oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifth of the remaining Arctic polar bears depend on Chukchi
Sea ice in their hunt for food, yet new oil leases are opening up
in the area and oil companies are lining up to obtain licences to
drill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/photosvideos/slideshows/polar-bears-feel-the-heat" class="act"&gt;View a slideshow of Greenpeace activists at the
Department of Interior.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bear essentials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising Arctic temperatures are reducing both the extent and
duration of the sea ice, forcing polar bears to spend more time on
land away from vital food supplies. The disappearing ice is
particularly hard on breeding females, who must feed both
themselves and their cubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some areas, polar bear birth rates have dropped by up to 15%
in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some climate models predict that the Arctic could be completely
ice-free in summer by 2030. While, the US Geological Survey issued
a report in September 2007 warning that, if current global warming
projections continue, two-thirds of the world's polar bears will
likely be extinct by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drilling for oil in the Chukchi Sea will also subject polar
bears to the threat of oil spills and other industrial
disturbances. But, it doesn't stop there - once the oil is burned,
it will exacerbate global warming, and that in turn will accelerate
the melting of the Arctic sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bear facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With grim statistics and timelines like this, it's hard to
understand why polar bears aren't already being protected. Being
listed as a "threatened" species under the US' Endangered Species
Act (ESA) will ensure that any action carried out, authorised or
funded by the United States government does not jeopardise polar
bears' continued existence or adversely modify their critical
habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, forming a coalition with the Centre for Biological Diversity
and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), we initiated the
ESA process for the polar bear back in February 2005, calling for
it to be listed under the Act due to global warming. It was time to
throw the polar bears a desperately needed lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the ESA, a listing process of no longer than two years
must be followed. Together with the Center for Biological Diversity
and the NRDC, we sued the Bush Administration in December 2005 when
it missed the first deadline in this process. In February 2006, in
response to our lawsuit, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced
that the protection of polar bears "may be warranted," and began a
full review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A settlement agreement in the case committed the Service to make
the second of three required findings in the listing process by
December 2007. At this time, the Service announced its proposal to
list the species as threatened and had one year to make the final
listing decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the US government has received more than 670,000
messages in support of protecting the polar bear, including letters
from eminent polar bear experts, climate scientists and US Congress
members - a record number of comments in support of an Endangered
Species Act listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal deadline to make the final decision to list the polar
bear was January 9, 2008. It is now two months overdue. That's why
we're going back to the courtroom. There's no more time for delay -
the US must list the polar bear as a threatened species and take
those steps to ensure that it is fully protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US needs to act now - cancelling oil-drilling leases in the
Chukchi Sea and immediately implementing plans for deep cuts in US
global warming pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Sign up and get our free newsletter straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Donate to support the energy revolution!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A shipping container filled with sawn timber from an eco-forestry project in Lake Murray, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has arrived in Sydney, Australia.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/men-from-the-village-of-aweika.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Men from the village of Aweikaimqassi work together to prepare a freshly cut tree for milling on a portable sawmill, as part of a local eco-forestry project.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the eco-forestry project, we teamed up with the local
people and set up the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/"&gt;Global Forest
Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt;on the shore of Lake Murray in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue station was used as thebase for surveying the
surrounding forest to determine traditional clanboundaries, and
training for the local communities in land and businessmanagement,
marketing and timber milling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the arrival of the first shipment of taun, rosewood
and red cedar to Australia, Lake Murray landowner, Sep Galeva said
that while it had taken his people a lot of hard work over the last
few years to get the timber exported, this was just the first of
many containers to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#video" class="act"&gt;Watch the video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we have shown is that anybody can do this. Forest
communities around PNG don't have to rely on industrial logging for
survival, they can do it themselves in a way that protects the
environment and keeps the land for future generations," Mr Galeva
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our bad experience with illegal and destructive logging from
the Kiunga Aiambak road project, run by Concord Pacific, made my
people choose eco-forestry instead so that we have control over our
land."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Sam Moko added, "By doing this they
willcontinue to enjoy all the benefits their forests traditionally
providethem and get real income from cutting their timber for
generations tocome."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There has been a lot of pressure on communities in LakeMurray
to sign their land away to logging and palm oil interests
andlandowners need to make informed decisions before they agree to
the bigcompanies, otherwise they could find themselves regretting
theirdecision and facing ongoing social, environmental and legal
issues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"TheLake Murray people involved in eco-forestry have thought
about theiroptions and have decided to take their future in their
own hands."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Lake Murray approached Greenpeace, the Foundation
for People and Community Development (FPCD), Barefoot and other
non-government organisations to help them get their eco-forestry
project off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yati Bun, Executive Director of FPCD, this kind of
initiative is a way for landowners to take charge of their forest
resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We joined the Lake Murray initiative to support landowners
manage the forests themselves and make sure they are getting the
maximum benefits," Mr Bun said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are earning 2-3 times what they would get locally from
logging companies for their sawn timber. Over the long term
eco-forestry provides economic, social and environmental benefits
to local communities, empower them to be self sufficient and
ensures their valuable forest resource survives into the
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want other PNG forest owners to know that eco-forestry is a
viable alternative to logging, and that they can make very good
returns exporting timber to Australia but they also need to know
that it is not easy. If people want to choose to control their own
destinies they must commit themselves to working hard and not sit
back and expect things to just come to them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lake Murray eco-forestry initiative has been supported by
funding from Doen Foundation in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Where does all the e-waste go?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-toxic-not-in-our-backyard210208/</url><text>
	Do you know what happens when you throw out your old electronic gadgets? Probably not, but considering they contain both toxic chemicals and valuable metals you'd think someone would know? Unfortunately our new report 'Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard' reveals the fate of millions of tonnes of e-waste generated each year is largely unknown.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/guiyu-ewaste.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/guiyu-ewaste.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of old electronics, or e-waste, such as computers, phones and TVs being discarded every year is growing rapidly. In many countries it's the fastest growing type of waste as cheap prices mean replacing electronics is cheaper than fixing them, while low price often means low quality and a very short life spans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As electronics increasingly become part of the throw away culture in many developed countries, amounts of e-waste have dramatically increased while solutions have often lagged far behind. Even in the European Union (EU) that has tighter regulation 75 percent of e-waste is unaccounted for. Of the estimated 8.7 million tonnes of e-waste created annually in the EU a massive 6.6 million tonnes of e-waste is not recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US there is very little regulation of e-waste. Less than 20 percent of US e-waste is recovered for recycling. Worrying the recycling percentages for PCs (10 percent) and TVs (14 percent) are even lower. The imminent switch to digital TVs in the US and elsewhere will lead to a massive increase in the amount of redundant analogue TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even from the 20 percent of e-waste collected in the US much is exported  because the US is one of the few countries where it's still legal to export collected e-waste to Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/e-waste-china-toxic-label.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;E-waste dumped in China, with a label clearly indicating it was collected for recycling in California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge amount of e-waste not recycled can be accounted for by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Storage: Often old electronics are stored in people's houses. This only serves to delay the day they are finally discarded and reduces the chances they could be effectively reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Landfill/Incineration: When mixed with domestic waste electronics will most likely end up in a landfill or incinerated. Both methods allow toxic chemicals to pollute the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Reuse and Export: Old computers and phones are often exported to developing countries for reuse or recycling. The vast majority are crudely recycled in e-waste scrap yards causing widespread pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Divide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries like India and China have long been a destination for e-waste dumping by unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick profit on e-waste from the US and Europe. Now the amounts of domestic e-waste generated by these countries is growing fast. In India only one percent of e-waste is collected for authorised recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Asia and Africa informal recycling yards have sprung up where low paid migrant workers use primitive methods to extract valuable metals. This informal recycling creates massive environmental pollution and damages the health of workers and residents in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even well intentioned shipments of computers for reuse are being abused. In &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-trash/carroll-text"&gt; Ghana many traders report&lt;/a&gt; that to get a shipping container with a few working computers they must accept broken junk like old screens in the same container from exporters in developed countries. The broken junk and eventually even the working computers inevitably ends up dumped in Ghana where there is no infrastructure to safely recycle toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clear solution is for the major electronics companies to eliminate the worst toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling programs. Having generated demand for the latest new mobile phone or sleek laptop and made vast profits from sales of electronics it should not be a problem the companies are allowed to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/old-mobile-phones-e-waste.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Mobiles at a recycling plant. Only a fraction of old mobiles are recycled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 more than one billion mobile phones were shipped worldwide. However, Nokia (the market leader) recycles just 2 percent of the phones it sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major computer makers do little better, with currently an average recycling rate of just 9 percent. That means the major companies don't recycle over 90 percent of their old products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the rising tide of e-waste all manufactures must offer free and convenient recycling of their products to all their customers. Where companies are unwilling to do this tough legislation is need to ensure electronics are safely recycled. Japan has effective recycling legislation and Sony reports that it collects 53 percent of it's old products in Japan. That's five times better than the global average for major PC makers and shows that solutions are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace calls on Philips to take-back &amp;amp; recycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/philips.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most companies accept responsibility for recycling their own products, and are improving their recycling programs for consumers, several TV companies are dragging their feet on recycling with the majority offering no recycling for old TVs in many countries. Of the TV companies, Philips stands out by publicly stating that recycling is the responsibility for the customer and government and consumers should pay for recycling, not the product makers. Behind the scenes Philips lobbies to avert legislation to make companies more responsible for recycling their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Philips is helping ensure the status quo remains, that has lead to such a large e-waste problem. We have delivered this report direct to Phillips and other companies to show how they need to stop hiding from the problem of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-waste: The good, the bad and the ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since August 2006 we have been &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; ranking the major electronics companies' efforts&lt;/a&gt; phase out toxic chemicals and improve recycling programs - both vital steps to tackle e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies have made big strides to improve their products and recycling schemes since the introduction of the Guide. But no company has so far succeeded in offering an entire range of products free of the worst toxic chemicals or a comprehensive, free, global takeback scheme to ensure responsible recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite. Not accepting corporate donations means we rely entirely on people like you to help keep us going. Some of our corporate targets spend in a few hours what we spend in an entire year. Please help with anything you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Big in Japan: how the whaling debate is changing</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/big-in-japan/</url><text>
	If the news in Japan is any indication, recent events in the Southern Ocean seem to be having some effect on a debate that has so far been stifled by the one-sided opinion of the whaling fleet operators, the Japanese government-funded Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) and its dubious public relations spin.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan spokesperson Junichi Sato discusses vote buying outside the "Normalization" meeting for the IWC, organised by the Japanese government.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of our campaign to stop whaling forever is to address
the propaganda that the ICR and the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA)
has been pushing to Japanese people for years - that anti-whaling
means "anti-Japanese" and that anti-whaling protestors are all
violent "terrorists" -so the Japanese people need to support the
government against these protests. Whaling will only be ended when
the Japanese government hangs up its harpoons, not just because we
come to the Southern Ocean to stop individual whales being
killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Anti-whaling does not equal anti-Japanese&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our office in Japan has bravely released an internet travelogue
called &lt;a href="http://www.whalelove.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Whale
Love Wagon&lt;/a&gt;.  Based on a popular Japanese TV program known as
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Love Wagon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, the program will go for ten weeks and feature a young Japanese
woman and a Spanish man. In each of the weekly stories, various
issues will be examined; such as the ecology of whales, different
views between the people inside and outside Japan, the history of
whaling by western countries as well as Japan, and international
efforts and treaties about whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EP2ivPop5Es" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Whale Love Wagon episode 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Setting the record straight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"More than 92 percent of Japanese people don't even know that
their government is the only one that hunts whales in the Southern
Ocean Whale Sanctuary and this year planned to kill 945 minke and
endangered fin whales," explains Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan
Oceans Campaign Project Manager. "In addition, outside Japan many
believe that all Japanese people support whaling, and subsequently
criticise Japan as a whole. We hope the Whale Love Wagon will
dispel the myths and set the record straight on all sides."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;In the news&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something seems to be changing.  Between Whale Love Wagon and
the offer of help from the Esperanza crew in the Southern Ocean,
reports in Japanese media have been unprecedented in their
even-handedness and even positive portrayals of Greenpeace. "It's
even more than I expected!" says Junichi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the most popular daily evening news programs
called "News Station" (or Hodo Station in Japanese) on TV Asahi,
ran the story about the Nisshin-maru which drifting for a week
after the fire on it,  and the presenter led by saying "this
problem is complicated".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cool-headed communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this week, the major Japanese newswire Kyodo ran a piece
about the fire on the Nisshin Maru that killed 27 year old crewman
Kazutaka Makita. The article concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If JFA and ICR had shown insight deep enough to accept
Greenpeace's offer, it could have been a sufficient trigger for
cool-headed communication about whaling. In that way, the death of
Mr.Makita would not have been wasted."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, as the debate gains more objective scrutiny inside
Japan, we can end whaling once and for all. But it isn't easy. As
Junichi wrote in a recent email update toGreenpeace staff, "So as I
write this email, I am getting "you die"messages in my mail box
also".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Next steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we are continuing political work to pressure
politicians at the highest level to act rather than talk at the
coming International Whaling Commission meeting in Anchorage,
Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help by &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action"&gt;pressuring
Poland to pay up and join the IWC&lt;/a&gt;, and helping us come up with
new ways to &lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/campaign/5837" target="_blank"&gt;keep the pressure on Denmark&lt;/a&gt; to support the
moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Create your own anti-whaling campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship's weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Updates from the crew of the Esperanza, in the Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Behind the spin: bearing witness in the Southern Ocean</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/icr-lies/</url><text>
	22 February - In the last week, the difference between what we see and hear, here in the Ross Sea, and what we read in the news could not have been more stark. We are getting conflicting reports from the whaling fleet and from the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), Mr Glenn Inwood, who is thousands of miles away on land.  Dave and Sara on the Esperanza take a look at the truth and lies of Southern Ocean whaling.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The normal whale research program ends around late March, so westill have three to four weeks left and the fleet is going to continuewith the work there&lt;/span&gt;,"
Mr Inwood &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21263102-1702,00.html"&gt;has
been saying&lt;/a&gt;. He even told Radio New Zealand "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;we might even startwhaling again as soon as today&lt;/span&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We" doesn't seem to include the whalers themselves.  Yesterday,
our campaigner Sakyo spoke to the whaling fleet's expedition leader
via radio,and asked him if the fleet were starting whaling again -
the answer was no. He added that therewas still a lot of work to be
done on the ship. They have managed tostart the main engine, but
the winch is broken down - due oilpressure problems - and the ship
has yet to move under her own power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;"Having a laugh"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;It is certainly not in anyone's interest to give any information,or correct information, to Greenpeace. They are not a signatory toanything down there. Maybe the skipper was just having a laugh,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" - Inwood to Radio New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might not be a signatory to anythingdown here, but Japan is
-  to the &lt;a href="http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/antarctic_treaty_summary.htm"&gt;
Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt;.  The Antarctic conditions are nolaughing
matter. Not only has one person lost their life, butwe've got a
drifting whaling factory ship, an environmental threat, anddozens
of crewmen working in the tough conditions of theRoss Sea. It seems
unlikely that thewhaling fleet's expedition leader, who is
currently trying to deal witha broken-down 8,000-ton ship, has
thetime and inclination to make up stories "for a laugh", not to
mention that the captain of the chaser ship the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Yushin Maru &lt;/span&gt;told
Maritime New Zealand &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/22/asia/AS-GEN-Antarctica-Crippled-Whaler.php"&gt;
the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;"Absolutely no threat"?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21263102-1702,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mr Inwood also likes to say&lt;/a&gt; that there is
absolutely no threat to the Antarctic environment from the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;.
Unfortunately, unlike the Esperanza, none of the Japanese whaling
fleet is "iceclass" - meaning they are not are built to deal with
severe seaice conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not recognising a potential "threat" to the pristineAntarctic
environment that could be sparked off by some adverse
weatherconditions leaves Mr Inwood looking a little short on
hisunderstanding of geography, meteorology and physics. There's a
reported 1,000 tons of oil on board the stranded factoryship.  Also
with the fleet is a fuel tanker, the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/span&gt;,
flagged toPanama, that has not filed an Environmental Impact
Assessment inaccordance with the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Environmental Impact Assessments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually,&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the vessels inthe whaling fleet
have submitted environmental impact assessments(EIA). Because the
whaling fleet claims that it is only answerable to theInternational
Whaling Commission, it doesn't follow Antarctic Treatyprocedure. 
One such procedure is the &lt;a href="http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/madrid_protocol.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Madrid Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which subjects &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;
activities taking place in the Treatyarea to prior scrutiny for how
they might affect the environment here - including through fires
like the one on the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is party to both the Antarctic Treaty and theMadrid
Protocol, so it seems strange that the Japanese governmentdoesn't
require its whaling fleet to submit EIAs. Especially considering
that the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not a whaling ship and therefore not even exempt from the
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what we see and hear, and we know what Mr Inwood is
reportedto have said and put out in his own press releases - we
leave you todecide who is bearing witness to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

	We've launched a new website to ensure 'good wood' is used to build the villages and venues of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  The new website, GoodWoodWatch.ca, will track use of environmentally and socially responsible Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified wood.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its bid to hold the Games, Vancouver 2010 committed that new buildings and infrastructure required for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games will be a showcase of the best in green building design and construction techniques. And we're holding them to that promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and a coalition of environmental groups behind the website are calling on the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) and all Olympic venues to use FSC-certified wood in their building construction.  The FSC is an internationally recognized standard for environmental and socially responsible management of forests. For over two years, environmental groups have been in contact with VANOC, regional municipalities and venue architects to educate and advocate for the use of wood from responsibly managed forests with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will VANOC get a gold medal for sustainability? The coming months of construction will lay the foundation for the Games' environmental record.  The world is watching and the time to use FSC-certified wood in the Olympic venues is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of &lt;a href="http://www.goodwoodwatch.ca/"&gt;GoodWoodWatch.ca&lt;/a&gt; marks the beginning of a Greenpeace survey of FSC wood use in Olympic venues. The results, to be released in the coming months, will give Canadians and the international community a way to assess the footprint of the Vancouver Olympic Games on the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian public deserves to know the environmental footprint its Olympics are making on the forests of British Columbia.  This website is a way to reward the leaders and expose the laggards, in Olympic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ninety million hectares of forest are FSC-certified, with the largest forest area here in Canada. Forest Stewardship Council Certification is currently the only way to guarantee that wood, paper and other forest products come from sustainably managed forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on the FSC can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.fsc.org/"&gt;www.fsc.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Greenapplefeaturedonate"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our ship the Esperanza is still standing by the stricken whaling ship, Nisshin Maru, disabled by fire in the Southern Ocean.  We have already provided information on ice conditions and are in radio contact with the Nisshin Maru crew.  We are all hoping the weather holds to avoid increased risk of an oil spill.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The disabled Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru with a re-fuelling vessel and hunter vessel tied alongside. Fire broke out on the Nisshin Maru on Thursday and one man is still missing. The Greenpeace ship Esperanza is close by, and has repeated the offer to assist the whaling fleet including possibly towing her out of the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our media officer on board the Esperanza, Sara Holden, said the
weather got marginally worse today.   "It's still not bad by
Southern Ocean standards, but the wind is picking up, visibility is
reduced and the temperature is falling," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, the whaling "spotter" vessel the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Kaiko Maru &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arrived in the area and we were told that the second such vessel
is on route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to offer assistance, including towing if
necessary, and are urging the Japanese authorities to do whatever
is needed to get the disabled vessel out of this area as soon as
possible. If the weather worsens, which is fairly likely in
Southern Ocean conditions,  a ship the size of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can easily flounder and sink and with an estimatedthousand tons
of oil aboard, it could present a major environmentaldisaster in
the pristine Antarctic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza is a former Russian firefighting vessel and has
the equipment on board necessary to tow the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, as well as a captain with 10 years' salvage experience. It is
unknown whether the ships in the Japanese fleet have the right
equipment, and our captain informs us that in any case the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, the whaling fleets' refuelling vessel, is too large to
manoeuvre the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to safety in rough weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we have been using our helicopter, Tweety, for aerial
surveys to assessthe ice conditions nearby.  The pack ice to the
south of our positionhas moved 3 miles north in the last 24 hours
and is now only 10 milesaway.&lt;/p&gt;

	The stricken whaling ship Nisshin Maru has ropes and cables attached indicating that the crew is making preparations to depart the Antarctic Treaty Area by towing.  It is not yet clear what vessel will tow the ship or when.  The Nisshin  Maru is currently lashed to the fleet's tanker the Oriental Bluebird, which sails under the Panama flag. Panama is not a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty.

            A Greenpeace inflatable inspecting ice conditions at the request of the disabled Japanes whaling vessel, the Nisshin Maru.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew of the Esperanza is waiting with bated breath for an
announcement on the fate of the stricken whaling ship the Nisshin
Maru.  The Japanese crew is still trying to start the engines of
the ship, disabled by fire last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the sensitive Antarctica environment, the
weather has held. However, our helicopter surveys of the area
indicate that to the South of us there is floating ice 2 miles
away, and east of us the ice is moving northward and is now 20
miles away.  Where we were one day ago is now completely iced over
- that is how changeable the conditions in the Southern Ocean
are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="350" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6fMXp6M6KUQ"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire and subsequent risk to the pristine Antarctic
environment illustrates the dubious nature of this industry,
particularly given the lack of preparation and conscientiousness
shown by the Nisshin Maru's operators, the Japanese
government-affiliated Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Risks to the environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, the Japanese whaling fleet ships are not ice
class (they are not obliged to be, however, this obviously
increases risk when operating in an area and time when there is a
risk of ice floes) and neither is the tanker the Oriental Bluebird,
currently claimed by the ICR to be the most likely candidate to tow
the Nisshin Maru. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese fleet has also not filed an Environmental Impact
Assessment. Japan is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty.  Under
this treaty, they are obliged to submit an Environmental Impact
Assessment before entering the Antarctic area.  This Assessment is
supposed to ensure that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_Principle"&gt;Precautionary&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polluter_Pays"&gt;Polluter
pays&lt;/a&gt; principles are evoked when there is a risk to the
environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Oriental Bluebird is not flagged to Japan, or
indeed, any vaguely oriental country.  It is flagged to Panama - a
common "flag of convenience" state - which is not a signatory to
the Antarctic Treaty.  However, as New Zealand Prime Minister Helen
Clark indicated earlier this week, it is clear the world "would not
forgive Japan" if the Nisshin Maru caused an environmental disaster
after failing to accept our help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the threat of an oil spill seems to have receded for
the immediate future, but in the changeable conditions of the
Southern Ocean, anything can happen, particularly if towing the
Nisshin Maru through ice floes with an inappropriate vessel in icy
weather.  This only goes to show the unncessary pressure that the
whaling fleet puts on the Antarctic environment - all in the name
of "science".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action/nisshin-maru"&gt;Ask the Japanese Environment Minister to do the right thing for the crew of the Nisshin Maru and the environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Latest updates on the Nisshin Maru situation from the Esperanza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>New movie damns Monsanto's deadly sins</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/monsanto_movie080307/</url><text>
	A new movie has dealt yet another severe blow to the credibility of US based Monsanto, one of the biggest chemical companies in the world and the provider of the seed technology for 90 percent of the world’s genetically engineered (GE) crops.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/aerial-view-of-a-crop-circle-m.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/aerial-view-of-a-crop-circle-m.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Aerial view of a crop circle made by local farmers and Greenpeace volunteers in Isabela province, 300 km northeast of Manila. The crop circle, with a slash over the letter 'M' symbolizes farmer's rejection of genetically-modified Bt corn crops from Monsanto corporation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French documentary, called "The world according to Monsanto"
and directed by independent filmmaker Marie-Monique Robin, paints a
grim picture of a company with a long track record of environmental
crimes and health scandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="339" width="420"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/x4drlw"&gt;
&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;

&lt;embed src="http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/x4drlw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="339" width="420"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story starts in the White House, where Monsanto often got
its way by exerting disproportionate influence over policymakers
via the "revolving door".   One example is Michael Taylor, who
worked for Monsanto as an attorney before being appointed as deputy
commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991.
While at the FDA, the authority that deals with all US food
approvals, Taylor made crucial decisions that led to the approval
of GE foods and crops. Then he returned to Monsanto, becoming the
company's vice president for public policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these intimate links between Monsanto and government
agencies, the US adopted GE foods and crops without proper testing,
without consumer labeling and in spite of serious questions hanging
over their safety. Not coincidentally, Monsanto supplies 90 percent
of the GE seeds used by the US market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's long arm stretched so far that, in the early
nineties, the US Food and Drugs Agency even ignored warnings of
their own scientists, who were cautioning that GE crops could cause
negative health effects. Other tactics the company uses to stifle
concerns about their products include misleading advertising,
bribery and concealing scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Monsanto's background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto was founded in 1901 as a chemical company. Its history
is intimately linked to the production and promotion of highly
toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange (used as a chemical weapon in
the Vietnam war) and PCBs (widespread toxic pollutants). Robin's
movie reveals that Monsanto already knew about the "systematic
toxic effects" of PCBs for decades, but instructed its salespeople
to stay silent because, "we can't afford to lose one dollar."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently Monsanto received a bad reputation for the
promotion of growth hormones from GE organisms known as rBGH, which
the company sells in the US under the brand name Posilac. Monsanto
claims that Posilac holds, "benefits to consumers". The reality is
that, rBGH growth hormones were banned in Europe and Canada after
the authorities found out about the health risks resulting from
drinking milk from cows treated with rBGH hormones. Monsanto's way
of "addressing" this problem was to sue the Oakhurst dairy company
in the state of Maine (US) - attempting to force them, and other
dairies, to stop labelling diary products "rBGH-free" and
"rBST-free".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Global reach, control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Monsanto aggressively bought up over 50
seed companies around the globe. Seeds are the source of all food.
Whoever owns the seeds, owns the food. The process of genetic
engineering allows companies, such as Monsanto, to claim patent
rights over seeds.  Ninety percent of all GE seeds planted in the
world are patented by Monsanto and hence controlled by them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patents on seeds give companies like Monsanto unprecedented
power. Monsanto prohibits farmers saving patented GE seeds from one
crop to replant the next season, an age-old practice. To ensure
that farmers do not reuse seeds, Monsanto created its own 'gene
police', and encourages farmers to turn in their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even farmers that do not use GE seeds are not safe. According to
an investigative  report by the Centre for Food Safety (CFS)
farmers have &lt;a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/Monsantovsusfarmersreport.cfm"&gt;
even been sued&lt;/a&gt; for patent infringement after their field was
contaminated by pollen or seed from someone else's GE crop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Monsanto's influence doesn't stop at the US border. "The
world according to Monsanto", documents the devastating impact of
Monsanto's malpractices around the world. Among others, it includes
the real-life stories of cotton farmers in India that ended up in
hopeless debts after using Monsanto genetically engineered (so
called Bt) cotton, and of a family in Paraguay, South America whose
dreams have turned to nightmares after their farm became surrounded
by fields planted with Monsanto's GE soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A much needed expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto wouldn't address these issues on camera for Robin,
instead referring to the "Monsanto Pledge" posted on their website
(&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/7-deadly-sins/"&gt;
which we debunk here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing "The world according to Monsanto", Greenpeace
International campaigner Geert Ritsema said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mrs. Robin should be congratulated for revealing the sinister
practices of the world's leading producer of genetically engineered
seeds. Her film is alarming and should be a call to action for
everybody who cares about the quality of our food and a healthy
future for our planet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie will be shown for the first time on ARTE TV (in German
and French) on Tuesday 11 March at 21.00. You can order a DVD of it
(in English, French and Spanish) &lt;a href="http://www.arte-boutique.fr/detailProduct.action?product.id=245754"&gt;

	One of the biggest events in the car industry's calendar, the ongoing Geneva Car Show is awash with companies talking green, talking 'climate control'. When Greenpeace looked under the bonnet of the of the industry PR green machine it found the same old engine of climate destruction. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/genevacarshow.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/3/genevacarshow.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists at the Geneva car show pose the question, 'What is a Good Car?'
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's analysis reveals that the average auto on display
pumps out an excessive 201 grams (g) of CO2 per kilometre. Forty
grams greater than the current average for cars on the road of 160g
and well above a twelve year old broken promise from the industry
to get down to 140g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMW lined its stand with diesel cars, each with their emissions
level emblazoned on the side. Fiat dressed their stand in foliage.
For visitors to the show it was an impressive, even overwhelming
display of green marketing. But behind the hype and foliage, the
industry's true colours can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty Greenpeace activists who disrupted the proceedings where
desinctly unimpressed. Surrounding select models they where there
to challenge the industry to answer the question: "What is a good
car?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/geneva-car-show-co2-emissions.xls" class="act"&gt;View the list of cars and their CO2 emissions
(.xls)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate campaigner Helen Perivier summed it up: "For a century
the industry has sold us a dream of faster, bigger, heavier cars.
The climate crisis means the new century requires a new definition
of what makes a good car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present CO2 emissions from road transport and aviation are
growing twice as fast as overall CO2 emissions. It has been
estimated by 2050, left unchecked, emissions from transport could
account for between 30 and 50 percent of total global greenhouse
gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Geneva show Renault unveiled cars with average emissions
of 186 grams, BMW's came in with an average emissions of 187 grams,
and Volkswagen racked up an astonishing 197 grams thanks to their
high performance Passats and Tiguans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If these are the cars the industry thinks we'll be driving in
the next few years, then it's clear they're not serious about
climate change. Only legislation can put the brakes on the car
industries reckless drive to ever higher emissions." said Helen
Perivier, Car Campaigner with Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the EU to impose a fleet wide average
fuel efficiency standard of 120g CO2 per km by 2012, and to reduce
this to 80g by 2020. Since car makers have failed to take the lead
in meeting this challenge governments must act to bring about these
changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greencenter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how the industry has been confusing car buyers
and politicians alike we're launching our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/goodcar" style="font-weight: bold"&gt;'Good Car' website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're asking you to start by picking out the worst car for the
climate on display at the Geneva car show - and to help you we've
narrowed the field to a choice of five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you pick the petrol hungry Toyota SUV or the little VW Golf
that is sold in huge numbers but isn't as fuel efficient as it
could be? Working out what makes a good car is a difficult
business. Take a look at all five models and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/worstcar4/" style="font-weight: bold"&gt;cast your vote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/merkel-cars-letter/"&gt;Please write to the Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, today asking her to support strong emissions standards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Esperanza is currently staying close by the Japanese government's whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, which was disabled by fire on Thursday. This afternoon, we received a radio call from the whaling crew to tell us that the body of their missing colleague, 27-year-old Kazutaka Makita, had been found. We offered our condolences to the crew and would like to extend them to Kazutaka Makita's wife and family.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Esperanza (foreground) and the Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru, disabled by a recent fire.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza had arrived at the location in the Ross Sea at
about 07.00 (New Zealand daylight time) today. Two ships - the
re-supply and re-fuelling vessel &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; and one
of the harpoon, or catcher boats  - were tied either side of the
&lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;.  Nearby were two more catcher boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Esperanza arrived, a US Coast Guard
icebreaker, the &lt;i&gt;Polar Sea&lt;/i&gt; appeared. They  said they were
also here to assess the situation. The Yushin Maru then asked our
campaigner from Japan, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/01/sakyo.html"&gt;
Sakyo&lt;/a&gt; to help translate between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Weather conditions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived the weather conditions around the ships was
quite good, with calm seas and clear visibility, but several
icebergs and loose ice nearby. But the weather forecasts indicate
that might well change  over the next couple of days. Over the
course of the day we saw once again how quickly conditions can
change here. The sunny morning turned into a cloudy snowy midday
and then once more into sunshine in the afternoon, but with
considerably more ice around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First contact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first arrived, Sakyo radioed the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;,
but received no answer. He then radioed the catcher boat, the
&lt;i&gt;Yushin Maru&lt;/i&gt; and repeated the assurance that the Esperanza
had come to help. They responded, asking us to standby and
requesting that we assess the ice conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza's helicopter made an initial aerial assessment of
the situation. After flying over the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;, it looked
fairly normal, with no sign of fire on the decks, or any sign of
damaged equipment. There was a lot of power cabling and ropes slung
between the catcher boat and the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;. The ship's
decks were white with snow and  approximately 12 people were
visible on the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Offer of help&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we offered to tow the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; north, in
order to assist and ensure there was no further threat to the
environment from the disabled vessel. The Fisheries Agency of Japan
responded by calling us "terrorists" an unhelpful response, given
the potential for further risk and danger in this already serious
humanitarian and environmental situation in depths of the Ross
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; is secured - to two other
ships, which takes care of short-term difficulties. It's been
reported that one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt;, could tow
the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;. However, Frank Kamp, the Esperanza's
captain, says that the &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; clearly isn't the
best option - and he has ten years experience on salvage vessels.
The &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; is too big and too difficult to
manoeuvre should more problems arise. As it stands, we're still the
best option should the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; need to be towed out of
the Ross Sea, so we'll wait nearby to see what happens in the
coming hours and days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Something is rotten in the state of Denmark == and beyond&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the world, other pro-whaling nations have been
getting themselves into trouble. While at the so-called
"normalisation" (commercialisation of whaling) meeting in Tokyo,
Danish IWC commissioner Ole Samsing suggested excluding both media
and NGOs from future International Whaling Commission (IWC)
meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We responded, questioning whether or not we had
&lt;i&gt;misunderstood&lt;/i&gt; Mr Samsing. The media seems to have seized
upon this, and asked Mr Samsing for clarification. He repeated his
suggestions to the journalists, which has caused a scandal in
Denmark, where the foreign minister will now have to explain
Denmark's position in the IWC in parliament, where he is sure to be
grilled by the environmental committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Nicaragua scandal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Nicaragua, another whaling scandal has broken out.
Two newspapers have published articles on a scandal involving a Mr
Marenco, who was at the "normalisation" representing Nicaragua. The
thing is, Mr Marenco &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; to be the IWC commissioner, during
a former, highly corrupt government. He wasn't in Tokyo as an
official representative of Nicaragua at all - his bosses at the
ministry thought that he had left on holidays! (Read an update
about this from our Oceans Campaigner Shane on the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/02/anything_but_normal.html"&gt;
Ocean Defender weblog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some news from the good guys in whaling:, the
environment minister of Costa Rica, which is a pro-conservation
country, has announced that the country will be voting at the IWC
meeting in Anchorage, Alaska in May. Costa Rica had been having
some problems reconciling debts with the IWC, but has managed to
clear these debts though local private entities. Welcome back,

	After three days of meetings in Tokyo, the pro-whaling members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) have concluded that the best plan to move forward is to keep hunting more whales.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan spokesperson Junichi Sato discusses vote buying outside the "Normalization" meeting for the IWC, organised by the Japanese government.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not exactly surprised - the mission statement of this
meeting was, after all '&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;to put forward specific measures to resume the function ofthe IWC as a resource management organisation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'.   "That basically meanshunting whales, explains Shane
Rattenbury, Head of Our Oceans campaign, who was at the
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government this morning presented a new proposal
for what they claim is "small scale" coastal whaling, but rather
than continue to call it science, it is now being referred to as
"community whaling".  However, the plan remains unaltered - to
catch 220 whales, despite having virtually no market, no scientific
justification, and no community benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Business as usual&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a clear sign that 'normalisation of the IWC' simply
means continuing with the current situation - catch as many whales
as possible," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan whales
campaigner. "No new ideas have come from this meeting.  The only
concrete proposals are to have secret ballots at the IWC, to hold
closed meetings, to exclude NGO's where possible, and to keep
catching the same number of whales." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear the IWC needs to be modernised - to increase
transparency, and to explore ways to protect whales for the future.
The onus now clearly rests on the governments from other countries
to seize the initiative, and make the IWC a body that works for the
whales and not for the whalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shane added that perhaps the best way to sum up this meeting is
to let the delegates speak for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I have worked for 25 years in European affairs and 13 years in theBrussels Council of Ministers, which works very well, because there isno access to meetings for press and NGO’s&lt;/span&gt;"
- one delegate evidently committed totransparency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; am a human being, and I get frustrated. I want to see theresumption of whaling as soon as possible&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" - the Chair of the Normalisation meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>IWC "Normalisation" meeting to begin</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iwc-normalisation-meeting-to/</url><text>
	This week the Japanese government will host a meeting of predominately pro-whaling International Whaling Commission (IWC) members in Tokyo.The stated purpose of the meeting, which is not part of the official Commission agenda, is to "normalize" the IWC. Almost without exception pro-conservation members of the Commission have agreed not to attend. It is expected that the Japanese government will use the occasion to claim there is support for a resumption of commercial whaling.

            The Japanese Fisheries Agency whaling fleet leaves  Shimonoseki, Japan bound for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with plans to harpoon 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato, our Project Leader in Greenpeace Japan, explains
what "normalise" means.  "'Normalising' is a codeword for
commercialising the IWC," he says.  "Greenpeace believes the IWC
needs to be reformed, but into a body that works for the whales and
not the whalers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is time that the conservation countries at the IWC put as
much effort into defending the whales as the pro-whaling nations

	Greenpeace activists took to the streets across the globe on Valentine's Day to send a message of love to Japan from 28 different countries, while at the same time demanding the government end high seas whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace manga-girl Stina met the head secretary of the Japanese embassy in snowy Stockholm, but only if the "potentially dangerous" flowers were left outside the gates. We delivered our message - we love Japan, but whaling is meaningless and breaks our hearts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Greenpeace volunteers carried a giant Valentine's
card, addressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to pro-whaling members of the International Whaling Commission
(IWC),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;currently meeting to discuss "normalising" the Commission, which
read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Normalization Means Protection, Not Whaling". &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/ocean-defenders-tv"&gt;
Check it out on Ocean Defenders TV ("To Japan, With Love").&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fax was also sent to the Nisshin Maru - the factory ship of
the whaling fleet, which read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We Love Japan, but Whaling Breaks Our Hearts! 69 percent of
your fellow Japanese do not support what you are doing in the
Sanctuary and there is virtually no market for what you are
producing. The "research" you have been ordered to carry out is not
wanted by scientists and the meat is not wanted by the Japanese
people. On this Valentine's Day, a day for spreading love we ask
once again that you leave the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and
return to port."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, flowers, hearts, chocolates, kisses, whale-watching
discounts and romantic gondola trips were delivered by Greenpeace
activists to embassies and tourists in France, Germany, Chile,
Italy, Australia, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands,
Costa Rica, Fiji, Guatemala, Greece, New Zealand, Spain, Russia,
Uruguay, Ireland and the US. (Check out the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/image-collections/we-love-japan-valentines-from?MM_URL=webstory"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;To Japan, with love&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not just frivolous fun. We want to send a clear message
that we are not anti Japanese, we simply oppose whaling," said
Junichi Sato, whales campaign leader in Greenpeace Japan. "We know
that 69 percent of Japanese &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whaling-poll-japan/"&gt;
do not support&lt;/a&gt; what their government is doing in the Southern
Ocean and 95 percent never or rarely eat whale meat. Whaling does
not belong in the 21st century and the only way forward for the IWC
is to start working for the whales and not the whalers," Sato
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship the Esperanza is in the Southern Ocean right now,
pursuing the whaling fleet.  But you can campaign with us - take
action now at &lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;whales.greenpeace.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a Valentine!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action/e-cards/size-matters-whale-e-card?MM_URL=DOOwebstory"&gt;Send a Valentine to a friend and show your love for the whales!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship's weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Keep up with the crew and get all the news from on the ground in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On Sunday 12 February, the Esperanza received a distress call.  This time it was from the Japanese Government whaling fleet's unarmed sighting vessel, the Kaiko Maru, claiming a collision with the Sea Shepherd vessel Robert Hunter.  "We completely condemn any violent action by anyone. Potentially endangering lives in the middle of the Southern Ocean is unacceptable," said Karli Thomas, expedition leader on board the Esperanza.

            Where the focus should be: stopping the killing of whales. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza offered immediate assistance, heading at full
speed to their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand first
reports stated the Kaiko Maru was "under attack." Later reports
claimed a collision between the Sea Shepherd vessel Robert Hunter
and the Kaiko Maru, with the Robert Hunter receiving a hole in the
hull above the water line and the Kaiko Maru suffering unspecific
damage to its propeller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karli adds, "While these three vessels are engaged in a
potentially life threatening incident, just over the horizon hunter
ships with grenade tipped harpoons could be killing whales. That is
where the focus should be."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 18.15, the Rescue Coordination Centre of New
Zealand requested that the Esperanza "stand down". The Rescue
centre was informed that we would remain within VHF range if
assistance were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Read reports straight from the Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Join an online campaign or start your own.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Esperanza departs and Denmark whale meeting looms</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/esperana-and-denmark/</url><text>
	The expedition to defend the whales is now under way. On Friday, the crew of our largest and fastest ship, the Esperanza, waved goodbye to supporters on the quayside in Auckland, New Zealand. It's now en route to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, as part of a global campaign to finally bring an end to whaling. It's also the last leg in the "Defending our Oceans" expedition which began in November 2005 and saw two of our ships - including the Esperanza, in Antarctic waters. On that trip, our activists managed to directly stop the killing of 82 whales, and this year they will again be putting themselves between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace ship Esperanza departs for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza's crew - 38 people from 16 countries - will be
searching for Japan's whaling fleet, which plans to kill 935 minke
whales and 10 endangered fin whales in what they claim to is
"scientific whaling", but which we say is nothing less than
commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="leavingnzplayer" align="middle" height="270" width="360"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the expedition is just part of a much bigger campaign. Back
on land, our work to end whaling will be focused on engaging with
the two-thirds of Japanese people who do not support whaling in the
Sanctuary, via websites like &lt;a href="http://www.whalelove.org/en/wagon/"&gt;Whale Love Wagon&lt;/a&gt;, as
well as building a global crew to campaign together via the website
&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;whales.greenpeace.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Last year our campaign forced corporations out of the whaling
business, now the Japanese government is spending tax payers money
on a redundant industry that the majority of the voters in my
country don't even agree with," said Junichi Sato, whales project
leader in Greenpeace Japan, speaking from Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want to work with the two-thirds majority at home who share
our view, so a clear message is sent from the people of Japan to
their own government to get out of whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-whaling organisations - such as the Institute for Cetacean
Research - often spin opposition to whaling as being "anti-Japan".
Our campaign will send a positive message that we love Japan - but
not whaling. We want to make it clear that while people all over
the world want to see an end to whaling, there is respect and
understanding of the Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese government is not the only one that we will be
challenging to stop whaling," said Esperanza expedition leader
Karli Thomas. "Too many governments have talked about protecting
the whales without taking action.  They need to ensure that they
gain enough support inside the International Whaling Commission
(IWC) to begin the process of reforming it, so it becomes an
organisation that works for the whales and not for the
whalers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How Can You Help?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;join the biggest
crew ever&lt;/a&gt; - and start your campaign to stop whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ask Denmark!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, the Japanese Government will host a meeting in Tokyo
to discuss the future of the whaling industry. Other governments
will be invited, in an attempt to create an illusion of widespread
support for an end to the International Whaling Commission's
moratorium on commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;We're asking Denmark not to go to this meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark is a swing country at the IWC. It takes a strong
pro-whaling line because its delegation is dominated by the wishes
of Greenland and the Faroe islands. But a majority of its
population opposes whaling, and Denmark has supported many positive
initiatives to protect whales and maintain transparency at the
IWC.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two Swedish supermarkets, ICA and COOP, have been caught red-handed selling Baltic cod despite our recent revelation that a third of it is illegally caught.  To make matters worse, ICA is even running an advertisement campaign to sell Baltic cod.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists mark Baltic cod products at an ICA store with "STOLEN FISH" stickers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers have confronted staff and placed "STOLEN FISH"
stickers on products in the stores, and handed out flyers to alert
customers that their fish might be pirate bounty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICA is the only big Swedish supermarket that has not agreed to
stop stocking frozen Baltic cod. It is also one of only two
supermarkets, the other being COOP, that still sells fresh Baltic
cod.  In fact ICA is blatantly advertising it in their catalogues
(see graphic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2007/8/ica-catalogue.gif" alt="Baltic cod in ICA catalogue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;(C) ICA AB, Sweden&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other large supermarket chains in Sweden such as Axfood
(Hemköp/Willys), Lidl, Netto Sweden and Bergendahlsgruppen (City
Gross, AG:s, Eko) have all declared they will stop stocking Baltic
cod, both frozen and fresh, since &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/"&gt;our
announcement that a third of it is illegally caught&lt;/a&gt;.  This is
an increasing problem in the Baltic since these unregulated catches
come on top of quotas that are already way above what scientists
recommend, pushing the cod stocks to the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans campaigner Frode Pleym, recently having been on board the
Arctic Sunrise and seeing the situation for himself, said, "ICA and
COOP must stop stocking &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltic cod immediately.  We found fresh Baltic cod filets in
COOP's stores, both in Malmö and Lund, and they have failed their
customers."  Our activists gathered video evidence of COOP
cheerfully and openly selling fresh Baltic cod despite the large
amount of media attention in Sweden and the positive actions of
their industry counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-pirate work taking place on land and at sea is part of
our demand for Marine Reserves in the Baltic.  A network of Marine
Reserves would make it much easier to control pirate fishing rather
than the patchwork and ineffective controls in place now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Birds Eye and Iglo, some of the biggest buyers of Baltic cod, to clean up their act too!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender and help us Make Piracy History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Both the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise are working with law enforcement agencies to battle pirate fishing on different sides of the planet. The story is the same from the Pacific to Poland, along with a lack of government resources  to tackle the problem.  At least the pirate excuses are amusing, ranging from “our nets must have moved” to “my reporting system is faulty”.  But for fish stocks, it's not so funny.

patrolling FSM's fishinggrounds for illegal fishing, finding out
first hand how difficult it isto monitor 2.7 million square
kilometres of ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overthe course of 16 days, we boarded five suspicious vessels. 
Fourof them were fishing with apparently "faulty" reporting
systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ifthese boats aren't reporting, it means there is no way of
knowing howlong they stay out to sea for, nor how much (or what)

&lt;p&gt;Onboardthe Esperanza, campaigner Lagi Toribau said, "Two key
Pacific tunaspecies are already in big trouble and, unless we see a
drastic cut infishing rates, they will be severely depleted within
three years.Distant foreign nations take nearly all our fish,
giving Pacificnations a pitiful 5 percent of the US$2 billion the
fish is worthannually."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People in these far off nations includingJapan, US, EU, Korea
and Taiwan, don't know that they may be eatingtuna stolen from
people whose lives depend on it. "Governments must actnow to
regulate their ships, we as consumers must start questioningwhere
our fish comes from, and retailers must refuse to stock
stolenfish," said Lagi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;...and cod in crisis&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Sweden retailers have been doing just that after our campaign
&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/" target="_blank"&gt;revealing the extent of illegal cod for sale in
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.  Meanwhile, in Poland, our activists found several
pirates last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thecrew on the Arctic Sunrise first spotted several suspicious
trawlers onWednesday 13 September.  The day after they confiscated
illegalnets and took the largely undersized cod out of them. The
area wassupposed to be closed to fishing until September 15.
Howeverauthorities chose to give them back to the fishermen
claiming they"lacked the authority to confiscate them".&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One fishermanblamed the incident on the nets, saying that they
had drifted into theclosed area, an obvious lie, not to mention
quite a feat consideringthe nets were firmly anchored to the sea
bed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CampaignerIda Udovic explains: "They hadn't moved an inch since
he placed themthere. The Polish government need to seriously
improve their system forfisheries control, much more money has to
be invested in capacity forinspections and law enforcement."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Making piracy history&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are demanding a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of marine reserves&lt;/a&gt;to shut down the pirate trade
and allow stocks to recover. Marinereserves make controls much
easier than the current patchwork ofregulations that have made
control impossible. Additionally all fishingvessels should have a
device onboard enabling electronic surveillance,controls ashore and
off shore should increase and a black list for allvessels caught
cheating should be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be takingall the findings we gathered in the Pacific to
the regional TunaCommission when they meet in Brisbane, Australia,
later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action: tell Unilever to stop buying Baltic cod&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Birds Eye and Iglo buy a huge amount of cod, some of it caught illegally from the Baltic.

	Yesterday, the Arctic Sunrise crew found illegal nets set for cod in the eastern Baltic.  But the pirate fishermen are in for a surprise when they return.  Our crew has confiscated the nets, but helpfully left a note on a buoy with a phone number the pirates can call to get them back.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace confiscates illegal fishing nets. The net is registered to a Polish vessel fishing illegally in the Baltic Proper.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we hope the pirates do call because they've got some
explaining to do.  As part of a fisheries management plan, the
eastern Baltic is closed to cod fishing between June 15 and
September 15.  Obviously, someone thought they could get a head
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, pirate fishing is rampant in the Baltic Sea - where
it is estimated that every third cod brought in is caught
illegally.  And the nets we found today were mostly full of small
cod. None of the fish in them was old enough to spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern cod stock is severely threatened and scientists have
recommended a complete halt to cod fishing in this area. Yet, the
EU proposed quotas of 38,000 tons for 2007.  Coupled with the
rampant illegal fishing, unsustainable EU policies are paving the
road to extinction for the Baltic cod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Yeah right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists also boarded two fishing boats in the area closed
to cod fishing. Onboard we found hundreds of kilos of cod, and the
nets where still wet. The fishermen claimed the cod was caught far
away in the western area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Holding up fishing rods they said they only stopped in the area
for recreational fishing. Even though I may not be able to prove it
in court I'm convinced these guys where fishing pirates," said Ida
Udovic, from on board the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Following the money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard the same vessels Greenpeace also found several boxes
from Europe's largest cod supplier, Espersen AS, Denmark. In 2001,
Espersen was caught using cod fished illegally in the Baltic Sea.
The company was fined 134,000 euros. In early 2006 they where
caught again, this time receiving illegal cod from the Barents Sea.
In the latter case, Espersen claimed to have been ignorant of the
true origin of the cod, and was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How to save the cod fishery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network of marine reserves - no take zones - would facilitate
enforcement and give cod stocks a chance to recover.  To go with
this, all fishing vessels in the Baltic should have a device
onboard enabling electronic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper controls on and off shore should be set up, and a
blacklist for all vessels caught cheating should be
established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Read updates from the crew on the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make piracy history&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Unilever to stop buying stolen cod.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate fishing fleet found - Again!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirate-fishing-fleet-found/</url><text>
	The Arctic Sunrise found them in Svetly, close to Kaliningrad, this time.  The Rosita (formerly Okhotino), Eva (formerly Oyra), Juanita (formerly Ostroe) and Isabella (formerly Olchan).  Earlier this year we caught up to these four ships in Germany.  Then later in Lithuania.  The fourth member of the fleet, the Carmen (formerly Ostrovets), we confronted in Poland.

            A notorious pirate fishing fleet in the harbour of Svetly in Kaliningrad. The ships are  blacklisted by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In all, we've tracked these pirates for over a
year. In thattime they have been re-named and re-flagged after
being blacklisted by theEuropean Union, Iceland and North East
Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a golden opportunity for Russia to stop these ships,
since allthese vessels are here illegally", said Frode Pleym,
Greenpeace campaigneron board Arctic Sunrise. "If Russia doesn't
act it's a clear violation ofinternational agreements. According to
the treaties the ships are not evenallowed to enter this port, and
any service to the ships - including pilotservices - is also
illegal," added Pleym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NEAFC is meeting tomorrow in Estonia.  During the meeting
Greenpeace will hand over the documentation from Svetly and demand
that the organization take the steps necessary to finally stop this
pirate fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

	IGLO/Birds Eye Frozen Foods is the Number one frozen food player in Europe, operating mainly in the UK under the Birds Eye brand, and in Germany and Austria under the IGLO brand. Birds Eye proudly proclaims it makes, "enough fish sticks every year to stretch around the equator!" What they don't tell you is that over a third of their cod fish sticks could be stolen, the fish plundered illegally from the Baltic and Barents Seas.

            Cod found in a pirate fishermen's net.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you buy a used car if a third of the parts were stolen?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Unilever sold Birds Eye and IGLO in Europe to Permira,
an investment company. The sale isn't final until the end of the
year. Unilever continually promises to ensure that all their fish
came from sustainable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they have a serious problem with a lot of illegal
fish in their supply chain, including cod. Danish company Espersen
is one of their main suppliers of cod. Espersen sources directly
and indirectly from the Baltic, and indirectly from the Barents.
This hides Unilever behind a wall of others, but this does not
remove their responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means Captain Birdseye cannot guarantee that the fish in
your supermarket is not from illegal pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the sale to Permira is finalized, Unilever should live up
to its promises and announce publicly its intention to ensure that
Permira isn't buying an illegal cod-laundering operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so bad about cod?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are calling for a drastic reduction of quotas, and
even a complete stop to cod fishing in the eastern Baltic Sea from
2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's bad enough that the official Baltic cod quota is 49,000
tonnes - more than three times the quota recommended by scientists
for 2006. To make matters worse, a huge amount of additional cod
which is illegally caught is landed in harbours around the Baltic
Sea bound for EU dinner plates - including your Birdseye or IGLO
fishsticks. At that rate, cod may soon be off the menu for
good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why target fish companies? What about governments?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birds Eye and IGLO are of the world's biggest users of cod and
have the power to influence the supply chain. Unlike many of their
competitors, Unilever has made no public commitment on countering
illegal cod in their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stop the stolen fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Captain Birds Eye to stop selling stolen fish.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Read updates from the Arcric Sunrise in the Baltic Sea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As our ship the Esperanza heads to the Pacific to tackle pirates and overfishing, the Arctic Sunrise heads north to battle another case of piracy.  Our new report reveals that 30 percent of the cod caught in the Baltic Sea is stolen, bound for European supermarkets.  Are there stolen goods in your refrigerator?

            The Arctic Sunrise
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oceans campaigner Ida Udovic said, "A legitimate company would
neverdream of buying or selling a car where they knew a third of
the partswhere stolen goods. But large distributors and
manufacturers of fishproducts ignore that their raw material could
be totally illegal, andlook the other way while our seas are being
destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Overfishing out of control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland, which is the centre for cod filleting across the region,
lastyear supplied Western Europe with an amazing 41 000 tons of cod
filets.The sheer amount of stolen cod, added to catch quotas that
way above those recommended by scientists, mean the recovery of
somecod populations is impossible. The International Council for
theExploration of the Sea (ICES: the scientific advisory body for
thenortheastern Atlantic region) and the European Union (EU) are
callingfor a drastic reduction of quotas, or even for a cessation
of codfishing in waters of the eastern Baltic Sea. The eastern
Baltic codstock has been reduced to only a tenth of its size during
the 'GoldenAges' of Baltic cod fishing in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the situation in the Baltic Sea is
disastrous:overfishing, pollution, eutrophication (nutrient
enrichment of thewater caused largely by agricultural run-off),
climate change, oilspills, bottom trawling and destruction of
habitats have made acatastrophic situation, further threatening the
survival of cod andother species.  The last thing we need on top of
this is piratefishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cod laundering&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can companies let this happen? Unfortunately it's hard to
tellexactly where the illegal cod from the Baltic ends up.  This
meansthat the company making your box of fish fingers can't tell
you if theycome from stolen stocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the companies that buy cod from Baltic catches, usually
freshfillets bound for restaurants,  are Pickenpack and
Frosta(Germany), Fjord Seafood (Netherlands), Västkustfilé (Sweden)
and RoyalGreenland (Denmark). Danish company Espersen has a key
role inprocessing and distributing frozen fillets sold under
various brandssuch as Euroshopper, and even in fast food
restaurants. With a turnoverof over 130 million euros, Espersen is
regarded as the largest codprocessing company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the clear problem, the Baltic Sea states routinely fail
to takeaction. The maximum average fine recently imposed anywhere
in theregion for illegal fishing has been a mere 538 euros.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Making Piracy History&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is in the Baltic as part of the Defending Our
Oceanscampaign and will be highlighting the issue of pirate
fishingthroughout the region.  We are demanding a network of
marinereserves to shut down the pirate trade and allow vital cod
stocks torecover. In addition all fishing vessels in the Baltic
should have adevice onboard enabling electronic surveillance,
controls ashore andoff shore should increase and a black list for
all vessels caughtcheating should be established.&lt;/p&gt;

Cod are severely over fished in the northern European seas and most are caught before they are two years old and have even had a chance to reproduce.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an important step towards saving the endangered cod
stock of the Baltic", said Ida Udovic, Greenpeace ocean campaigner
on board the Arctic Sunrise. "It's good that large retail chains
are now taking action where our politicians have failed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is in the Baltic Sea highlighting the issue
of pirate fishing throughout the region. We're demanding a network
of marine reserves to shut down the pirate trade, and allow vital
cod stocks to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Details of the deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Axfood AB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, one of the largest food retailers in Scandinavia agreed to
withdraw a batch of frozen cod filets from their shelves at their
100 Willy's stores since the producer Västkustfilé could not
guarantee that the products do not contain fish caught
illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Lidl Sweden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, according to previous Greenpeace demands, will only buy cod
that is landed in Norwegian and Icelandic harbours to minimize the
risk of buying illegally caught cod from the Barents Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Netto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, will stop buying Baltic cod as of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Only a beginning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is incredible that any company could continue to buy cod
from an endangered stock that could be illegally caught." added
Udovic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many other fish retailers continue to be complicit in the
trade of illegally and unsustainably caught Baltic cod.  For
example, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;ICA group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has said it will continue buying Baltic cod, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bergendahlsgruppen/City Gross&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has still not even answered our requests for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Marine reserves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine reserves make controls much easier than the current
patchwork of regulations that have made proper enforcement almost
impossible. In addition all fishing vessels in the Baltic should
have a device onboard enabling electronic surveillance, controls
ashore and off shore should increase and a black list for all
vessels caught cheating should be established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Read updates from the Arctic Sunrise in the Baltic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After three days of blockading the toxic tanker Probo Koala, we were pleased to hear that the Government of Estonia is investigating the ship, which is responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people in the Ivory Coast -- and the illnesses of thousands more, due to irresponsible dumping of toxic waste.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The "toxic tanker" Probo Koala, blockaded for three days by the Arctic Sunrise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Helen Perivier explains, "The Probo Koala
is an international toxic crime scene and needs to be fully
investigated to establish the full chain of culpability which led
to the tragic deadly events in the Ivory Coast," she said. "Only
through such an investigation can the guilty be brought to justice
and the lessons learned in order to prevent this from happening
again."  We were delighted to hear that the Estonian Authorities
are now taking such action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dumping the West's waste ... in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came to light on September 6 when the first casualties were
reported and protests broke out on the streets of Abidjan against
the government, which was blamed for allowing the dumping.  Despite
this, the Korean-built, Greek-managed, Panamanian-flagged and
Dutch-chartered tanker was allowed to sail freely …until we blocked
it from leaving Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of preliminary results it would appear that
contamination found on the Probo Koala by the Estonian Environment
Ministry is similar to that which poisoned the Ivory Coast.
Hopefully, Estonia will agree with the request of the Ivory Coast
to continue to detain the Probo Koala as part of the ongoing
Ivorian criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;From one crime scene to another&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise, which took up position in Paldiski on Monday
to prevent the imminent departure of the Probo Koala and branded it
an "EU TOXIC CRIME SCENE" will now return to the Baltic to continue
its work against pirate fishing, overfishing and for the
establishment of marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest upates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Check the weblog for the latest updates from the Arctic Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Suspected pirate flees Kiribati Authorities</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/suspected-pirate-flees/</url><text>
	At around 3pm yesterday afternoon the team on the bridge of the Esperanza spotted a vessel on the horizon.  By 4pm we could see it was a Korean longliner, the Dong Won 117.  There are two fisheries enforcement officials from the Pacific Island of Kiribati onboard with us, and we went out with them to check out the boat. Richella King, our web editor on board the Esperanza, reports on what happened next and the shady world of Dong Won Industries.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Campaigner Lagi Toribau and Kiribati Law Enforcement Officer Taremon Korere in discussion with Captain Park Si-Joeng of the suspect Korean longliner 'Dong Won 117'. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Dong Won 117 is licensed to fish in Kiribati waters
theDong Won fleet is notorious for operating on the wrong side of
the law.Dong Won ships have been sighted acting illegally
throughout theEastern Pacific numerous times. We thought the ship
was worth a routineinspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dong Won 117 lived up to it's reputation on at least four
counts.  First, in what is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/dodgy-and-dodgier-pirate-fish/"&gt;
becoming characteristic of legal ships in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;,the Dong
Wong 117 has been reporting intermittently through it's
VesselMonitoring System (VMS).  The system allows the Foreign
FisheriesAssociation (FFA) and individual countries to monitor
fishing ships inthe Pacific region.  The FFA told the Dong Won
117's owners theirsystem was faulty, only last week.  Because of
this she shouldhave headed straight to the nearest port to get it
fixed, and phoned toreport her position every day until she got
there.  The Dong Won117 failed to do this, so there is no record of
where she has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly,her last recorded port of call was Busan, Korea, 13
months ago. Typically Longliners can stay at sea for between 3 to 4
weeks beforethey need to resupply.  Informal chat between our crew
and theirsshowed they had not been in port for a very long time -
the first andmost pressing bit of information needed was about who
won the World Cup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inorder to stay out at sea, the longliner must have been
resupplied by a'bunker' ship.  Bunkering is only legal if the
supply ship islicensed and each transaction documented.  Needless
to say theDong Won 117 hardly had any documents; the ones it did
showed it tohave bunkered with another boat with dodgy
reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even moresuspicious than sporadic reporting and patchy paperwork
was the lack offish.  If a longliner of Dong Won's size had been
fishing for 13consecutive months it should have run out of hold
space some timeago.  Instead her 300 ton hold was barely more than
halffull.  This suggests she was transhipping - offloading catch
atsea, a mostly illegal practice which fishing boats use to
avoidofficial monitoring or scrutiny of their hauls.  Because it is
soeasy for ships to launder their catches this way, we are calling
for aglobal ban on transhippping anywhere other than in port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterthe inspection we stayed with the Dong Won 117 through the
night,waiting for the Kiribati marine authorities' patrol boat
toarrive.  Early in the morning the Dong Won 117 hauled in her
linesand made a break for the high seas.  Orders to stop were
ignoredand she steamed off at high seas, very suspicious
behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheDong Won 117 is owned by a large Korean corporation, Dong
WonIndustries.  In addition to owning a fishing fleet Dong Won owns
distribution and logistics companies. Dong Won's stock price
islisted as a healthy US$54.  Kirbati, in contrast, is a
nationwhose gross domestic product per person is a mere US$800. 
DongWon has large ships, while Kirabati authorities have only one
boat topatrol their 3 million square miles of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems stems from the fact that Korea as a country
ispaying pathetic license fees.  In 2004 Korea paid Kiribati
US$3.1million for 135 longliners to fish in Kiribati. That amounts
to aboutUS$23,000 per vessel, the equivalent of about 23 tons of
skipjacktuna.  In the case of longliners they are after tuna with a
muchhigher value, so the amount of tuna they have to catch to earn
backtheir license fee is really a lot smaller.  For Kiribati it is
ofcourse a lot of money, but for Korea and her businesses it is a
veryfavourable investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help us make piracy history&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;On the other side of the planet more pirate fishing is occurring - help us to stop the money trail and ask Birds Eye and Iglo to stop buying illegal fish!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Read the weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;More updates from the Esperanza in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	During the Esperanza's tour of the Philippines our crew bore witness to shocking environmental tragedy.  But we were also impressed by the resolve of people here to protect their marine resources for the benefit of future generations, and we were lucky enough to also visit places of amazing beauty.

&lt;h3&gt;Manila bay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead of a fresh sea breeze there is a strange smell, a
mixture of chemicals, garbage and rotten fruits. When we met this
morning at the harbour with the local Greenpeace activists the
problem was obvious before we could even see it: rubbish, rubbish
and more rubbish, simply thrown into the water."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Heike, web editor on board the Esperanza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/manila-bay-6.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that plastics and various industrial chemicals and
domestic sewage are suffocating the bay's once productive waters,
and joined volunteers from the Manilan "Eco Waste Coalition" in a
clean up.  We filled garbage bag after garbage bag, and hardly made
a dent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the trash was from was plastic from 'single use' sources
(plastic bags, beverage bottles, cups and other items intended to
be used once and thrown away).  Fortunately, we also got a lot of
media attention. Hopefully this will help with the bigger problem -
stopping the trash at its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Oil spill response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I learned to fish when I was seven years old. On Friday 12
August I was on my way back from school along the beach when I
found it all black. I didn't know what it was and thought it was
just some mud the sea had brought in and that would go away
quickly. But than I heard in the radio it was oil."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Francisco, 12-year-old student&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/mangrove-roots-and-new-shoots-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, August 11, a Petron-chartered single hull vessel
carrying 2.1 million litres of oil sank in Guimaras Strait -
causing the Philippines worst oil spill.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza helped the Philippines Coast Guard survey the
hardest hit area, aided local efforts to contain the spill,
transported clean up equipment and delivered relief supplies
donated for the tens of thousands of affected locals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I saw whole swathes of mangroves with their root systems
covered in the black tar. A clean up of such a tangled mass of
roots would be impossible; the oils will remain trapped within the
roots for years.   It made me so sad as I know mangroves are very
sensitive to oil pollution. These mangroves will probably die over
the next weeks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Dr. Janet Cotter, scientist on board the Esperanza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are very angry with the oil company. We took so much care of
our mangroves. They were really our pride - and now the company has
destroyed it. I think they have to pay a compensation. Not only to
the fishermen but also for the damage on the ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Connie Gamuya, counsellor of La Paz, island of Guimaras&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/greenpeace-needs-your-help"&gt;
Help the people of Guimaras.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rapu Rapu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The proximity of the mine to the sea means that the marine
organisms such as corals are likely to be impacted causing harm to
the fragile coral reef ecosystem. Such impacts on the reef would be
a disaster for marine biodiversity, including the whale shark, and
also local fisheries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Dr. Janet Cotter, scientist onboard the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/aerial-view-of-the-current-min.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Rapu Rapu Island the Esperanza joined a local flotilla of
some 70 traditional outrigger boats in protest against the gold and
silver mining operation.  The mine was reopened in July despite
government investigations, which revealed ongoing leakages of
highly toxic chemicals into the pristine waters of the Albay
Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace science team took water samples tracing water
contamination back to the mine, and our activists entered the
complex and hung a banner calling for the mine to be shut down.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These local people are justifiably outraged. The rich marine
ecosystem they rely on for food and livelihood is being destroyed
for the profit of far off multinational companies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Beau Baconguis, Greenpeace Philippines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action"&gt;Ask
ABN Amro and ANZ, two banks financing this mine, to pull their
funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Apo marine reserve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Apo Island has always been the model of hope for coastal
communities in the Philippines. It demonstrates how reserves can
effectively restore the productivity and biodiversity that once
characterized the seas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Daniel Ocampo, Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/colourful-basslets.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Apo, local fishermen used to use dynamite, and other
destructive fishing practices. Then a team from Siliman University
convinced them to try setting up a marine reserve instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the dynamite is history. The marine reserve, carefully
guarded by the local community, supports hundreds of species of
corals - and marine catches have doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If it was not an official reserve some fisherman would go back
to the old destructive methods, I think. We do a lot to educate the
people, especially the children. But it has to be official to make
sure everybody protects the sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tour that started with the launch of the Greenpeace
tunareport onboard the Esperanza in Barcelona, we've confirmed our
worstfears about the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin
tuna are being plundered, illegal driftnets known as "wallsof
death" continue to be used despite their prohibition and the
rampantoverdevelopment of the Mediterranean coastline is destroying
coastalecosytems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as we showed with the proposal for a network of marine
reserves for the Mediterranean, there is still hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theRainbow Warrior concludes the 2006 tour of the
Mediterranean, we lookback on some of the highlights and many
suprises from the past threemonths. From diving and documenting the
beauty below the surface,confiscating illegal driftnets and
rescuing sailors from sinking boatsto being blockaded by the
fishermen in Marseille, it's certainly been amemorable tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Mediterranean is in desperate need of a sea change

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate fishing fleet found - Again!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirate-fishing-fleet-found/</url><text>
	The Arctic Sunrise found them in Svetly, close to Kaliningrad, this time.  The Rosita (formerly Okhotino), Eva (formerly Oyra), Juanita (formerly Ostroe) and Isabella (formerly Olchan).  Earlier this year we caught up to these four ships in Germany.  Then later in Lithuania.  The fourth member of the fleet, the Carmen (formerly Ostrovets), we confronted in Poland.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A notorious pirate fishing fleet in the harbour of Svetly in Kaliningrad. The ships are  blacklisted by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In all, we've tracked these pirates for over a
year. In thattime they have been re-named and re-flagged after
being blacklisted by theEuropean Union, Iceland and North East
Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a golden opportunity for Russia to stop these ships,
since allthese vessels are here illegally", said Frode Pleym,
Greenpeace campaigneron board Arctic Sunrise. "If Russia doesn't
act it's a clear violation ofinternational agreements. According to
the treaties the ships are not evenallowed to enter this port, and
any service to the ships - including pilotservices - is also
illegal," added Pleym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NEAFC is meeting tomorrow in Estonia.  During the meeting
Greenpeace will hand over the documentation from Svetly and demand
that the organization take the steps necessary to finally stop this
pirate fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Shark finning mystery</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/shark-fin-mystery/</url><text>
	This photo was taken in a warehouse less than 100 metres from where the Esperanza had been docked.  While most of the team had been busy on official Defending Our Oceans business, Alex had come across evidence of a lucrative shark finning operation.  Maarten and I joined him and we spent the remaining two and a half hours in Pohnpei trying to unravel what was going on. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna." src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/10/a-refrigerated-warehouse-in-po.jpg" alt="A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna." width="600" height="404"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerated warehouses in harbours are not unusual. Nor are piles of dead fish waiting for export. What was strange was the pile of frozen finless shark carcasses. Sharks are frequently an 'incidental' catch of the tuna fishing industry. Such sharks are termed 'bycatch', and for an incidental catch they're good luck. While the body of the shark is worth almost nothing, sets of shark fins sell for US$700 per Kg. That is 70 times the value of a kilo of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An expensive, tasteless tonic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fins are dried and sold for use in shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese dish which sells for upwards of US$100 a bowl. Hong Kong is the centre of the shark fin industry with 70% of the world's shark fins ending up there. As the Chinese economy improves demand for sharks' fins is increasing by 5% a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal shark finning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fishing boats with limited holds and long times at sea, shark carcasses are a waste of space. Sharks caught as bycatch can be legally stripped of their fins - so the bodies can be stored in a smaller space, and the valuable fins dried fresh while still at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Illegal shark finning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuse occurs when sharks are specifically targeted, their fins removed and their bodies thrown back into the sea. This practice, known as shark finning, is barbaric and wasteful. Often the shark is still alive, while its fins are hacked off with a sharp knife,leaving it in agony. The shark's finless body is then dumped overboard and, being unable to swim, it drowns or dies of starvation. Although shark meat is low value compared to its fins, it is still edible and its liver and skin are highly prized in certain parts of the world. Shark finning targets only 2-5% of the shark's body mass and wastes the remaining 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shark finning around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shark finning has been banned in the European Union since 2003, and is illegal in the US and Eastern Pacific. However, there are some serious loopholes in the legislation. The amount of sharks caught incidentally varies according to fishing method and circumstance. So, it is impossible to determine exactly how many sharks have been caught unintentionally. For Longline fishing vessels - which set a lineup to 100km long, baited with up to 3,000 hooks - incidental catch ranges from almost nothing to around 20%. For Purse-seiners 40-50% is typical. When fishing vessels come into ports such as Pohnpei, they must show their logbooks - a record how much of each fish species they have caught - to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the weight of shark carcasses is within the expected range for the fishing method, the haul is assumed to be incidental bycatch. A further loophole surrounds the issue of the fins being cut from the shark's carcass. Obviously, there should only be one set of fins per carcass. However, the assessment is made by weight, not number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Determining whether the finning is legal or illegal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight of the fins as a proportion of body weight varies between different species of shark. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimate shark fins comprise, on average, 2% of body weight. This means one would expect 20kg of shark fin for every ton of shark carcass. The US allows up to 5% total shark weight to be fins - this means that for sharks with a low fin to body weight, more than one shark could be illegally finned and dumped for each declared shark. Earlier this week the European parliament rejected a call by its Fisheries Committee to increase the EU's legal ratio of fins to carcasses form 5 to 6.5%. This would have allowed more than two-thirds of sharks caught to be undeclared - opening a back door to the shark finning industry. The European Parliament is now calling instead for a decrease in the ratio to a scientifically acceptable 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story in Pohnpei&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei belonged to a Hong Kong based company called Luen Thai. In addition to over 60 finned shark carcases,the warehouse contained a few hundred frozen yellowfin tuna, 6 marlin and 2 moonfish. I spoke to one of the workers, who told me that the company runs 13 Longliners. Each stays at sea for about 3 weeks, catches around 300 tons of tuna and in the process 2 tons of shark. The products section of Luen Thai's website lists four species of tuna and eleven commercially valuable species of fish that are presumably frequently caught as bycatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25349/shark-fins-dry-on-the-deck-of.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mystery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal shark fining is brutal, but no more so than commercial fishing and with incidental catch rates of 0.67% it has little commercial value. Moreover, shark carcasses reek and are almost worthless - so, why keep over 60 of them in a refrigerated warehouse on the harbour front? Curiosity got the better of us, so we asked the guys working there what they were going to do with the sharks. Initially no one could come up with an answer, then they said the carcasses were going overseas somewhere, perhaps to be made into fish balls. With transport costs being as high as they are this didn't seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Maarten turned up with the video camera, the managers had arrived. They explained that the freezer was broken and that they planned to move the sharks. This made no sense, if the freezer in the warehouse was broken, why not rescue the high value tuna, moonfish and blue marlin? Instead the men set to work shifting over sixty worthless shark carcasses to a refrigerated van. The extreme responses to our cameras, suggest another motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the shark carcasses be resident incidental bycatch, always available to counted against fins caught illegally? Perhaps the 2 tons of shark was a reference to the weight of fins collected, and not total weight. This is not so unusual. Earlier this year twoSpanish Longliners landed 8 tons of shark fins in Suva, Fiji. With an estimated value of US $5.6 million this far exceeds the value of the tuna they would have caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexpected impacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal shark finning has a detrimental impact on ocean ecosystems; sometimes with a direct impact on fish stocks. Many sharks are top predators and as such their eating habits keep the structure and species composition of marine ecosystems in balance. Removal of sharks from an ecosystem can have complicated and unexpected results. For example, it has been found that the removal of tiger sharks from a tropical ecosystem resulted in a decline in the tuna population. The decline was because the sharks had kept populations of other predators of tuna in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradicating shark finning is humane, beneficial for sharks, for fisheries management and for all of us who depend on the health of our oceans. It is yet another example of the needless waste of ocean life, and the need for properly enforced marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two Swedish supermarkets, ICA and COOP, have been caught red-handed selling Baltic cod despite our recent revelation that a third of it is illegally caught.  To make matters worse, ICA is even running an advertisement campaign to sell Baltic cod.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists mark Baltic cod products at an ICA store with "STOLEN FISH" stickers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers have confronted staff and placed "STOLEN FISH"
stickers on products in the stores, and handed out flyers to alert
customers that their fish might be pirate bounty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICA is the only big Swedish supermarket that has not agreed to
stop stocking frozen Baltic cod. It is also one of only two
supermarkets, the other being COOP, that still sells fresh Baltic
cod.  In fact ICA is blatantly advertising it in their catalogues
(see graphic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2007/8/ica-catalogue.gif" alt="Baltic cod in ICA catalogue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;(C) ICA AB, Sweden&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other large supermarket chains in Sweden such as Axfood
(Hemköp/Willys), Lidl, Netto Sweden and Bergendahlsgruppen (City
Gross, AG:s, Eko) have all declared they will stop stocking Baltic
cod, both frozen and fresh, since &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/"&gt;our
announcement that a third of it is illegally caught&lt;/a&gt;.  This is
an increasing problem in the Baltic since these unregulated catches
come on top of quotas that are already way above what scientists
recommend, pushing the cod stocks to the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans campaigner Frode Pleym, recently having been on board the
Arctic Sunrise and seeing the situation for himself, said, "ICA and
COOP must stop stocking &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltic cod immediately.  We found fresh Baltic cod filets in
COOP's stores, both in Malmö and Lund, and they have failed their
customers."  Our activists gathered video evidence of COOP
cheerfully and openly selling fresh Baltic cod despite the large
amount of media attention in Sweden and the positive actions of
their industry counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-pirate work taking place on land and at sea is part of
our demand for Marine Reserves in the Baltic.  A network of Marine
Reserves would make it much easier to control pirate fishing rather
than the patchwork and ineffective controls in place now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Birds Eye and Iglo, some of the biggest buyers of Baltic cod, to clean up their act too!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender and help us Make Piracy History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Dodgy and dodgier: pirate fishing around the world</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/dodgy-and-dodgier-pirate-fish/</url><text>
	Both the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise are working with law enforcement agencies to battle pirate fishing on different sides of the planet. The story is the same from the Pacific to Poland, along with a lack of government resources  to tackle the problem.  At least the pirate excuses are amusing, ranging from “our nets must have moved” to “my reporting system is faulty”.  But for fish stocks, it's not so funny.

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25355/a-law-enforcement-official-fro.html" align="right"&gt;TheEsperanza has docked in Pohnpei, finally
revealing that we have beenworking with the Government of the
Federated States of Micronesia(FSM).   Together we have been
patrolling FSM's fishinggrounds for illegal fishing, finding out
first hand how difficult it isto monitor 2.7 million square
kilometres of ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overthe course of 16 days, we boarded five suspicious vessels. 
Fourof them were fishing with apparently "faulty" reporting
systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ifthese boats aren't reporting, it means there is no way of
knowing howlong they stay out to sea for, nor how much (or what)
they catch. We say if your reporting system is broken, you should
not be allowed tofish until it's fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tuna in trouble&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onboardthe Esperanza, campaigner Lagi Toribau said, "Two key
Pacific tunaspecies are already in big trouble and, unless we see a
drastic cut infishing rates, they will be severely depleted within
three years.Distant foreign nations take nearly all our fish,
giving Pacificnations a pitiful 5 percent of the US$2 billion the
fish is worthannually."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People in these far off nations includingJapan, US, EU, Korea
and Taiwan, don't know that they may be eatingtuna stolen from
people whose lives depend on it. "Governments must actnow to
regulate their ships, we as consumers must start questioningwhere
our fish comes from, and retailers must refuse to stock
stolenfish," said Lagi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;...and cod in crisis&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Sweden retailers have been doing just that after our campaign
&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/" target="_blank"&gt;revealing the extent of illegal cod for sale in
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.  Meanwhile, in Poland, our activists found several
pirates last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thecrew on the Arctic Sunrise first spotted several suspicious
trawlers onWednesday 13 September.  The day after they confiscated
illegalnets and took the largely undersized cod out of them. The
area wassupposed to be closed to fishing until September 15.
Howeverauthorities chose to give them back to the fishermen
claiming they"lacked the authority to confiscate them".&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One fishermanblamed the incident on the nets, saying that they
had drifted into theclosed area, an obvious lie, not to mention
quite a feat consideringthe nets were firmly anchored to the sea
bed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CampaignerIda Udovic explains: "They hadn't moved an inch since
he placed themthere. The Polish government need to seriously
improve their system forfisheries control, much more money has to
be invested in capacity forinspections and law enforcement."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Making piracy history&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are demanding a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of marine reserves&lt;/a&gt;to shut down the pirate trade
and allow stocks to recover. Marinereserves make controls much
easier than the current patchwork ofregulations that have made
control impossible. Additionally all fishingvessels should have a
device onboard enabling electronic surveillance,controls ashore and
off shore should increase and a black list for allvessels caught
cheating should be established.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Birds Eye/Iglo still linked to illegal fishing</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/birds-eye-iglo-still-linked-to/</url><text>
	Last week the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCE) met in Dublin to discuss how the industry would handle the increasing amount of illegal cod ending up in our burgers and fishsticks.  The good news: they made some promising recommendations.  The bad news: these are only "guidelines", and not binding. Two of the biggest brands – Birds Eye and Iglo – have remained silent in public about their commitment to these guidelines.

            Activist labels Baltic cod "STOLEN FISH" in a Swedish ICA supermarket. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines that AIPCE came up with were strangely familiar,
being pretty similar to our own recommendations.  However, they
only applied to Barents Sea cod and not Baltic Sea cod, which, as
we reported last month, is up to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/"&gt;30
percent illegally caught&lt;/a&gt;.  The guidelines are also very
general, nevertheless they are a good first step and deserve to be
widely implemented. (If you're really keen you can &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/AIPCE"&gt;download
the AIPCE guidelines here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Ocean Defenders have recently asked the number one
frozen food brands in Europe, Birds Eye and Iglo, to make a public
statement on how &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;they&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would avoid pirate fish in their products before the Dublin
meeting. So far, they have remained silent.  Birds Eye and Iglo are
in the process of being sold to a company called Permira, so they
are in the limelight right now as the industry waits for the sale
to be finalised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Captain Birdseye strikes back&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in response to all this publicity, a debate has been
waged on the industry news website &lt;a href="http://www.intrafish.no/" target="_blank"&gt;Intrafish&lt;/a&gt;.  The
site summarised a letter from Unilever, current owners of Birds Eye
and Iglo, in response to our recent actions involving Ocean
Defenders:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unilever felt comfortable purchasing from the [Baltic] region,
given European Commission proposals that fishing continue there,
and added that withdrawing for (sic) fishing in that area would
increase the pressures in other fisheries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our oceans campaigner in Norway, Truls Gulowsen, was pretty
shocked at that statement.  Truls explains, "I hope I have
misunderstood. Do Iglo and Birds Eye really claim to continue to
source cod from the depleted Eastern Baltic, until its possible
collapse, as a measure to protect other fish stocks? Or is this
just another piece of marketing work trying to confuse the
audience?"&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Truls also pointed out that while the European Commission did
indeed propose that fishing continued in the Baltic Sea, this was
against all scientific advice including from their &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scientific advisory body!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Don't call us, we'll call you&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birds Eye and Iglo also said in their statement that while they
would like to meet with us, "the future leadership of Permira's
frozen food business[...]is not yet finally designated, so we
cannot guarantee their presence."  The Unilever letter added that
no decision on Permira leadership would be made before the
beginning of November, although the new CEO has been named.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"'We assume in the meantime...our brands would not continue to
be targetedin public by your organization [Greenpeace] on these
issues,' Unilever said."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We disagree - we think consumers have the right to know what is
ending up in their seafood, and what the brands they are buying
stand for - right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mega fish fingers – 100 percent fish, 30 percent illegal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, it's quite strange that apparently no decisions can be
made before November (and more meetings), but yesterday Birds Eye
announced a new product - Captain Birdseye Fish Finger Megas, a
product aimed at "reinvigorating" the fish finger brand. So it
seems it's business as usual at Birds Eye, at least on some
fronts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intrafish reported: "The new product uses a larger 100-percent
fillet, and a healthier coating, aimed at reinforcing the notion
that Birds Eye is increasing the quality of its products, and
bringing 'new and lapsed consumers to the brand'. "&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'd like to know what exactly that "100-percent fillet" is.  Is
it 100 percent legal cod? We doubt it.  We also would like to know
that Birds Eye is increasing the quality of their products - but in
our case, that means a public statement on how they and Iglo will
take real, concrete steps to ensure that pirate fish doesn't end up
in your Mega Fish Finger.  Otherwise there may be a lot more of
those lapsed consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Birds Eye and Iglo that you would like to know (and now!) how they will tackle illegal fish in their products. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	IGLO/Birds Eye Frozen Foods is the Number one frozen food player in Europe, operating mainly in the UK under the Birds Eye brand, and in Germany and Austria under the IGLO brand. Birds Eye proudly proclaims it makes, "enough fish sticks every year to stretch around the equator!" What they don't tell you is that over a third of their cod fish sticks could be stolen, the fish plundered illegally from the Baltic and Barents Seas.
&lt;div&gt;

            Cod found in a pirate fishermen's net.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you buy a used car if a third of the parts were stolen?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Unilever sold Birds Eye and IGLO in Europe to Permira,
an investment company. The sale isn't final until the end of the
year. Unilever continually promises to ensure that all their fish
came from sustainable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they have a serious problem with a lot of illegal
fish in their supply chain, including cod. Danish company Espersen
is one of their main suppliers of cod. Espersen sources directly
and indirectly from the Baltic, and indirectly from the Barents.
This hides Unilever behind a wall of others, but this does not
remove their responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means Captain Birdseye cannot guarantee that the fish in
your supermarket is not from illegal pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the sale to Permira is finalized, Unilever should live up
to its promises and announce publicly its intention to ensure that
Permira isn't buying an illegal cod-laundering operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so bad about cod?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are calling for a drastic reduction of quotas, and
even a complete stop to cod fishing in the eastern Baltic Sea from
2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's bad enough that the official Baltic cod quota is 49,000
tonnes - more than three times the quota recommended by scientists
for 2006. To make matters worse, a huge amount of additional cod
which is illegally caught is landed in harbours around the Baltic
Sea bound for EU dinner plates - including your Birdseye or IGLO
fishsticks. At that rate, cod may soon be off the menu for
good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why target fish companies? What about governments?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birds Eye and IGLO are of the world's biggest users of cod and
have the power to influence the supply chain. Unlike many of their
competitors, Unilever has made no public commitment on countering
illegal cod in their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stop the stolen fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Captain Birds Eye to stop selling stolen fish.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Read updates from the Arcric Sunrise in the Baltic Sea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Artic Sunrise crew seizes pirate's fishing nets</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/baltic-piracy-confronted/</url><text>
	Yesterday, the Arctic Sunrise crew found illegal nets set for cod in the eastern Baltic.  But the pirate fishermen are in for a surprise when they return.  Our crew has confiscated the nets, but helpfully left a note on a buoy with a phone number the pirates can call to get them back.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/9/greenpeace-confiscates-illegal.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/9/greenpeace-confiscates-illegal.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace confiscates illegal fishing nets. The net is registered to a Polish vessel fishing illegally in the Baltic Proper.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we hope the pirates do call because they've got some
explaining to do.  As part of a fisheries management plan, the
eastern Baltic is closed to cod fishing between June 15 and
September 15.  Obviously, someone thought they could get a head
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, pirate fishing is rampant in the Baltic Sea - where
it is estimated that every third cod brought in is caught
illegally.  And the nets we found today were mostly full of small
cod. None of the fish in them was old enough to spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern cod stock is severely threatened and scientists have
recommended a complete halt to cod fishing in this area. Yet, the
EU proposed quotas of 38,000 tons for 2007.  Coupled with the
rampant illegal fishing, unsustainable EU policies are paving the
road to extinction for the Baltic cod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Yeah right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists also boarded two fishing boats in the area closed
to cod fishing. Onboard we found hundreds of kilos of cod, and the
nets where still wet. The fishermen claimed the cod was caught far
away in the western area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Holding up fishing rods they said they only stopped in the area
for recreational fishing. Even though I may not be able to prove it
in court I'm convinced these guys where fishing pirates," said Ida
Udovic, from on board the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Following the money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard the same vessels Greenpeace also found several boxes
from Europe's largest cod supplier, Espersen AS, Denmark. In 2001,
Espersen was caught using cod fished illegally in the Baltic Sea.
The company was fined 134,000 euros. In early 2006 they where
caught again, this time receiving illegal cod from the Barents Sea.
In the latter case, Espersen claimed to have been ignorant of the
true origin of the cod, and was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How to save the cod fishery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network of marine reserves - no take zones - would facilitate
enforcement and give cod stocks a chance to recover.  To go with
this, all fishing vessels in the Baltic should have a device
onboard enabling electronic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper controls on and off shore should be set up, and a
blacklist for all vessels caught cheating should be
established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Read updates from the crew on the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make piracy history&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Unilever to stop buying stolen cod.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory! Estonia launches toxic tanker investigation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-estonia/</url><text>
	After three days of blockading the toxic tanker Probo Koala, we were pleased to hear that the Government of Estonia is investigating the ship, which is responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people in the Ivory Coast -- and the illnesses of thousands more, due to irresponsible dumping of toxic waste.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/9/the-toxic-tanker-probo-koala.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The "toxic tanker" Probo Koala, blockaded for three days by the Arctic Sunrise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Helen Perivier explains, "The Probo Koala
is an international toxic crime scene and needs to be fully
investigated to establish the full chain of culpability which led
to the tragic deadly events in the Ivory Coast," she said. "Only
through such an investigation can the guilty be brought to justice
and the lessons learned in order to prevent this from happening
again."  We were delighted to hear that the Estonian Authorities
are now taking such action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dumping the West's waste ... in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came to light on September 6 when the first casualties were
reported and protests broke out on the streets of Abidjan against
the government, which was blamed for allowing the dumping.  Despite
this, the Korean-built, Greek-managed, Panamanian-flagged and
Dutch-chartered tanker was allowed to sail freely …until we blocked
it from leaving Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of preliminary results it would appear that
contamination found on the Probo Koala by the Estonian Environment
Ministry is similar to that which poisoned the Ivory Coast.
Hopefully, Estonia will agree with the request of the Ivory Coast
to continue to detain the Probo Koala as part of the ongoing
Ivorian criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;From one crime scene to another&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise, which took up position in Paldiski on Monday
to prevent the imminent departure of the Probo Koala and branded it
an "EU TOXIC CRIME SCENE" will now return to the Baltic to continue
its work against pirate fishing, overfishing and for the
establishment of marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest upates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/"&gt;Check the weblog for the latest updates from the Arctic Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish - at least not in the Mediterranean Sea until stocks recover. We're calling for the complete closure of the Mediterranean bluefin tuna fisheries.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

            Captive Bluefin Tuna inside a transport cage.Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the Mediterranean to protect bluefin tuna with marine reserves in their breeding and feeding areas.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've said "Time and Tuna are Running Out," in very large
letters on a very large banner, to the International Commission for
the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT), which is meeting in
Turkey this week to decide the fate of Northern bluefin tuna.  They
can't miss the message -- the question is whether they'll act to
save bluefin tuna from commercial extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known as "Shepherds of the Seas" the bluefin tuna has been
celebrated for thousands of years, and is world famous as a symbol
of the Med. Bluefin weigh up to 700 kg, and can reach 3 metres in
length. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was fascinated by their
incredible migrations.  The bluefin is one of the top predators of
the Med's food-chain, crucial to the Med's delicate ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are in serious trouble. The Med bluefin tuna fishery is
worth some US$1bn - in Japan a single tuna can sell for US$ 15,000.
But there simply aren't enough bluefin to sustain the world's
insatiable appetite. In 1999, we recorded how Med bluefin stocks
had declined by 80 percent, and it's getting worse. Rampant
over-fishing and pirate fishing is pushing this precious species to
the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We have the solution - marine reserves now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we have the solution - a network of marine reserves;
areas closed to all extractive uses, such as fishing and mining, to
cover forty percent of the Med. This means closing the bluefin tuna
fishery - indefinitely, until stocks recover. It may sound extreme,
but without bold action the fishery has no future whatsoever.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine reserves will save the tuna, the Med's ecosystem, and
ultimately the fishing industry. After all, the fishing industry
has a pretty miserable future if there's no fish left to, well,
fish...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Come on ICCAT - live up to your name.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation is a key word in ICCAT's title. Sadly, most of its
45 member states, including big fishing nations such as Japan,
France, Spain and Italy, are missing this crucial point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year ICCAT came up with a "bluefin tuna recovery" plan so
pitiful it makes a mockery of the term "recovery." Instead of
listening to their own scientific committee, which set a catch
quota (how much fish you are allowed to take) of 15,000 tonnes.
ICCAT's "recovery plan" virtually doubled this, allowing a quota of
29,500 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ICCAT countries can't even stick to limited rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The member countries couldn't even stick to that extremely
limited agreement. The Med has one of the highest rates of illegal
fishing in the world; the bluefin fishery is completely out of
control.  In September the European Commission declared the bluefin
fishery closed until the end of the year - because EU countries had
fished 20,000 tonnes of bluefin - 20 per cent over what they were
allowed for the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, the Greenpeace ships the Rainbow Warrior
and the Esperanza have documented European, Asian, and North
African fleets illegally fishing in the Med. Just a few examples
include catching Italian fleets illegally using spotter planes to
search for bluefin, a day after the ICCAT regulation banning them
came into force. Just after this we found an illegal tuna shipment
being made to Spain. The French fished 53 per cent above their
quota in 2005, in other words every third fish was illegal. (For
more on these scandals, see our "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/pirate-booty"&gt;Pirate Booty
Report&lt;/a&gt;.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Med is truly a shared global treasure - and a global
responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Med a global commons, and its protection is our collective
responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what a shared treasure; rich seagrass meadows and rocky
reefs dominate its coastal zone while an awe-inspiring array of
seamounts, cold seeps and trenches are found on its seabed. Within
these some 10,000 species live, 9 percent of the world's marine
biodiversity - all this despite the Med representing less than 1
percent of the word's oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over-fishing and destructive fishing is steadily eroding
this treasure. A network of large scale marine reserves will
represent a shift in the balance of human impacts, from damage and
harm to protection and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>James Bond the whale...licensed to krill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/jamesbond-whale-071107/</url><text>
	Even among people who agree that whales should not be killed needlessly in the name of research, opinions diverge wildly when it comes to naming them. So far we have received over 8,000 entries to name some of the whales that were tagged for the Great Whale Trail. Here are just a few of the suggested names ranging from heartfelt dedications, celebrities to the just plain strange.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Humpback whale swims past the Cook Island whale research boat, enjoying the warm water and the protected reefs of Rarotonga (Cook Islands). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the amazing features of the name-a-whale competition is the number of countries we have received entries from, 142 so far. With so many different people from all over the world submitting names, we have some great names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greencenter"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition is now closed having received over 10,000 entries.  You will have a chance to vote for the best whale names starting 19th November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whales of the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all over the world we have names like Youko, which is Japanese for 'ocean child', Rahu in Estonian means 'peace' whilst the name 'Shanti' is another word meaning 'peace', this time in Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tauelsiz means 'independent' in Kazakh, Befri means 'free' in Norwegian and Kekoa is Hawaiian for 'the brave one'. Suyana means 'hope' in the quechua language in landlocked Bolivia whilst Rangwani in the Shona language (used in parts of Southern Africa) means 'a huge clumsy fellow' and the Chinese have a great possible whale name in Jing Ling meaning 'spirit of the whale'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of possible names that are a bit harder to pronounce are shomoodrer-rajputro which means 'prince of the ocean' in Bangla (from Bangladesh) and Fa'amoemoe meaning 'hope' in the language of Samoa where some of the tagged whales are swimming past on their annual migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dedications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people would like to name a whale as a dedication to someone special or just after a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of great former Greenpeace activists, founding member Bob Hunter and photographer Fernando Pereira (who was killed when the Rainbow Warrior was bombed by French agents) were suggested as possible whale names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lennon, Bob Dylan, John Butler, Elvis, Mozart, Beethoven and Pavarotti were just some of the names of musical celebrities that have been entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone, film and television characters generated many fine possible whale names like Smithers from the Simpson's, Kermit the frog from the Muppets, James Bond, Yoda and Darth Vadar from Star Wars, Frodo, Gandalf and Aragorn from Lord of the Rings whilst Harry, Hermione, Hagrid and Dumbledor from Harry Potter all seemed to cast their spell on some of our entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other famous people to have their names entered are Steve Irwin, Einstein, Marco Polo, Leonardo da Vinci, Crazy Horse, Alexander the Great, Jacque Cousteau and the ethicist/animal liberation activist, Peter Singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedications to loved ones included people's sons like Tiago, Hugo (aged 8), Alvar (who we're told swims like a whale in the bathtub), Engin, Kai and Marcos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daughters too featured in many entries with Claudia, Natasha, Kokoro, Olivia, Estrella (born the same day her father entered her name in the competition!), Nea, Emilie and Pauline who is due to be born on the 30th November this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion featured prominently in the possible names with some ancient gods being particularly popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeus, Apollo, Hermes, Poseidon , Achilles, Artemis, Ajax and Aphrodite all appearing for the Greek gods but not to be outdone, the Nordic gods Thor and Freyja made an appearance, as did Ra the Egyptian sun god, Quetzalcoatl the Aztec god-king, Sedna the Inuit goddess of marine mammals and the Welsh gods Dagda and goddesses Morgana and Riannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political world also had their admirers with the names like Al Gore and Kyoto being suggested more than once as possible whale names as were some famous historical figures in Mahatma Ghandi, Evita and Che Guevara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Howard, the current Australian Prime Minister, received a somewhat poisoned chalice of a nomination with the nominee suggesting that the Prime Ministers name would make a great whale name as his career is endangered just like humpback whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The weird and wonderful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the 8,000 plus entries submitted so far, there are many great whale names but every now and again, you find an entry that makes you smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food names seemed to be mentioned more than most whales would be comfortable with. Names like Peppernose, Porkball, Fudge, Marshmallow, Chilli, Peanut, Noodle and Sushi all came up and names of drinks also appeared with Merlot, Champagne and Sherry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the just plain strange, you can't go past names like Bouncy, Moose, Buffy Jo, Avenger, Trilby Foxglove, Fluffy (you'd be amazed how often that came up), Swishy, Delicate Bamboo, Pinky, Megatron, Big Bertha, Big Kahuna, Big Ben, Big Roy (named after a hamster!) and Little George.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one that had us laughing the most, which is not to say it will get into the list of top names, was definitely the name Mister Splashy Pants.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Indonesian forest destruction dammed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/indonesian-forest-destruction291007/</url><text>
	Our volunteers and local forest communities have halted the destruction of an area of swamp forest in Sumatra, Indonesia. They are building five dams across three-metre deep canals used in logging and draining peatland for conversion into a commercial palm oil plantation. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/indonesia-palm-oil-destruction-action.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/indonesia-palm-oil-destruction-action.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists work with locals to halt drainage by constructing dams on the peatland canals. This will prevent the peatland from drying out and releasing carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destroying the forest there would not only breach Indonesian
regulations for forest protection, and an Indonesia's Presidential
decree, but would also lead to the release of large quantities of
greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thick layers of peat underlie most of Indonesia's swamp forest.
Over time, the peat layer has locked up millions of tonnes of
carbon. Once forests are cleared, peat swamps are drained and
decompose to release the stored carbon as carbon dioxide. Forests
are often also burned, prior to the planting of palm oil saplings,
further compounding the climate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the scale of forest destruction across Indonesia that
the huge amounts of greenhouse gases being emitted have made the
country into the world's third largest climate polluter, behind the
US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 30 volunteers will work for a week with people from
the nearby village to construct the dams. By halting drainage
operations, the dams will prevent the peatland from drying out and
releasing carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas. The dams will
also prevent the palm oil company from illegally burning the
currently waterlogged peatland, which would otherwise further add
to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Update - 31 October: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish petrol giant &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/10/swedish_petrol_giant_ditches_d.html"&gt;
ditches plans for deforestation bio-diesel&lt;/a&gt; made from palm
oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Palm oil companies are breaking the law and draining the very
life out of Indonesia's remaining peatland forests," said Hapsoro,
Greenpeace South East Asia forest campaigner. "And they are adding
substantially to the problem of global warming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damming is taking place on a plantation held by the PT Duta
Palma company. Our on-site investigations of the peatlands,
conducted from the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/indonesia-forest-defenders-cam/"&gt;
Forest Defenders Camp&lt;/a&gt; in Riau, and together with peatland
experts, have brought to light the flagrant violations of
regulations intended to protect these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exposing the destruction:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This urgent problem needs a global solution. We have set up the
Forest Defenders Camp on the boundary of forest clearing in a
region of Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check out life at the camp and why it's there:&lt;/h2&gt;

updates on their weblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to efforts to highlight and halt peatland forest
destruction in this one particular area, we are also attempting to
promote long-term solutions to deforestation in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia will be hosting the next round of international
climate talks in December. Governments from around the world will
gather in Bali to negotiate about extending the Kyoto Protocol -
the only international agreement containing legally-binding limits
on greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to ensure that deforestation is included in the next
phase of the Kyoto agreement, extending beyond 2012. The decisions
that governments make in the near future are critical for securing
the financing and capacity needed by countries to safeguard their
tropical forests and to allow them to make a serious contribution
to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know it is possible to keep the worst impacts of climate
change - such as extreme weather events, water crises and increased
hunger - from putting millions of people at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;This will take a revolution in the way we use and produce energy, and a strong commitment to halt deforestation worldwide. More governments need to commit to tougher emissions reduction targets in the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=indo-dam-signup"&gt;Sign up to find out how you can help tackle forest destruction and climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=indo-dam"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Eight Greenpeace activists trapped in a Brazilian environmental protection agency (Ibama) office, for nearly two days, have finally managed to escape. Our team was forced to seek refuge in the Ibama Amazon base, after loggers blocked them from transporting a dead Brazil nut tree we had government permission to collect and use. [UPDATED]
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/brazil-bulldozer-tree.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/brazil-bulldozer-tree.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Deforestation is responsible for three quarters of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, and makes the country the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;300 loggers, with eight trucks, ten vans, and 15 motorbikes
surrounded the building. Then, last night, Brazilian police
escorted our team to out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intended to use the Brazil nut tree as part of a public
exhibition exposing Amazon destruction and its contribution to
global warming. The tree was taken from land that had been
illegally cleared and burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 3px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 26 October -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the governor and the mayor of Sao Paulo have joined our
call for zero deforestation in the Amazon.  (&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/10/mayor_and_governor_of_sao_paul.html"&gt;
read more&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Government Sides with Loggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Brazilian government gave in to the loggers,
and revoked Greenpeace's license to remove, transport and exhibit
the valuable and protected Brazil nut tree, now in custody of the
loggers. Despite the government back down, many loggers continued
to surround the building with our activists inside. It was not
until police committed to escort them later that night, that the
Greenpeace team was able to make it to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loggers were undermining basic constitutional rights such as
security and freedom of movement. It is the second time in two
months that Greenpeace has been &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/08/threats_and_intimidation_down.html"&gt;
harassed like this&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;All this fuss over a tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That a mob of 300, many of them involved in illegal
deforestation, was allowed to stop eight activists from collecting
one dead tree shows how out of control the situation is in this
part of Brazil - and how special Brazil nut trees are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1994, the Brazilian nut tree (Bertholettia excelsa) has
been protected by law from burning and logging, but is still
endangered by illegal land clearing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can grow to over 50 metres tall, live for 500 years and are
integral to the rainforest ecosystem.  Brazil nuts grow in canon
ball like clusters about the size of grapefruits, which can reach
deadly speeds as they fall from the canopy.  Its fruit (nuts) are
extremely high in protein - eaten in the region and exported to
countries like the UK, Germany and Italy. The nuts are one of the
main non-timber forests products in the Amazon.  About one million
people depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this one tree is a symbol.  On this, even the illegal
loggers and the activists they blockaded agree.  The loggers have
said they will build a memorial with the tree in the town square.
For us, this is a memorial showing the lack of governance in the
Amazon - that the ones in charge aren't the government or the
people of Brazil, but the loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Brazil: World’s fourth largest climate polluter &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for three quarters of Brazil's
greenhouse gas emissions, and makes the country the fourth largest
climate polluter in the world. Our exhibition using the Brazil nut
tree to highlight this has wide support across the country.
Governors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have already confirmed
their attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil wants to be recognized as a serious player on the
international stage, yet can't even uphold its own constitution in
the Amazon.  Greenpeace is calling for including deforestation in
the post-2012 Kyoto climate regime to be discussed in Bali,
Indonesia this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Marcelo Maquesini, one of the team trapped inside the Ibama
office said, "If Brazil is to be taken seriously by the
international community in negotiations on climate, biodiversity or
human rights, then they need to be able to enforce basic law and
order in the areas where forests are being destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amazon deforestation must end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government should allow us to take the Brazil nut
tree as agreed. Tackling deforestation is an urgent issue, and
people in Brazil (and around the world) have a right to see first
hand the consequences of land clearing in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, in cooperation with nine other groups, two weeks ago
launched a proposal for a national agreement to end Amazon
deforestation at an event attended by the Brazilian Minister of
Environment and State Governors. The proposal seeks a broad
commitment from the Brazilian government and civil society to
create measures protecting the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=amazon-para-trapped"&gt;Sign up for our regular ezine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=amazon-para-trapped"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Nicolas Sarkozy, France's President,  yesterday called for an environmental "revolution".  Among other measures, he promised to outlaw energy wasting lightbulbs by 2010, ban commercial growing of genetically modified food and feed crops, and use the precautionary principle for all future government decisions.  If yesterday's words become laws, and those laws become deeds, it could be the spark that changes the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hang a 12 by 3 metre banner reading “Ban GMO’s NOW” on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris urging the French government to ban genetically modified organisms. The government is expected to decide in the next few days on the future regulation of genetically modified, or genetically engineered, crops. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Genetically engineered crop ban&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France - the EU's biggest agricultural producer - is the sixth
government in Europe to ban genetic engineered crops. (Austria,
Germany, Greece, Hungary and Poland are the other five.) The only
genetically engineered crop currently grown in France is Monsanto's
genetically engineered maize (MON810).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not clear if what was announced is a permanent ban, or a
temporary measure.  Sarkozy did cite three good reasons to avoid
growing genetically engineered crops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doubts about their usefulness.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Doubts about their benefits for health and the
environment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Concerns about their uncontrolled dissemination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're calling on other governments inside and outside of Europe
to follow this positive example," said Greenpeace campaigner Geert
Ritsema. "And to put the interest of citizens and the environment
before the interests of a handful of multinational corporations
such as Monsanto, Bayer, and BASF that produce and sell genetically
engineered crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Saving energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightbulb manufactures themselves are calling for an end to
energy wasting lightbulbs in Europe by 2019.  Sarkozy scores
considerably better with his target of 2010.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compact fluorescent lightbulbs use one-fifth the energy of
traditional incandescents lightbulbs.  Switching to energy saving
bulbs in the EU alone, would save 20 million tonnes of CO2, equal
to shutting down 25 medium-size dirty power plants.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sharon Becker said, "We hope that this
measure will open the eyes of other EU countries and that the
energy efficiency standards needed to ban these bulbs, will pave
the way for a broader spectrum of standards, for example for
electronics and appliances."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarkozy also called for more use of train transport, and better
fuel efficiency for cars.  Following through on the promise of cars
which emit on average 120 gram of CO2 per kilometre by 2012 would
have a knock-on effect globally by fully commercializing existing
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Nuclear - lack of progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Sarkozy gushed about renewable energy, it's clear
France is not quite ready to give up its nuclear addiction.  France
has 59 operating nuclear reactors, and is building a new one based
on what is called the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) design.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is also marketing its nuclear technology to countries
like the UK, US, China, Canada, Brazil and Morocco.  Already there
is an EPR nuclear plant under construction in Finland - years
behind schedule, over a billion euros over budget and plagued by
more than 1,000 documented quality problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good that Sarkozy agreed to phase out energy wasting
bulbs," said Greenpeace campaigner Jan Beranek.  "But by saying A
he should also say B, which is that thanks to plans for improved
efficiency, there is no need for additional reactors in
France."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Sustainability first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on in France, the burden of proof must be placed on
ecologically destructive activities, according to Sarkozy.  Rather
than environmentalists having to show that there's a better way,
companies and people proposing ecologically destructive decisions
need to prove there is no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important idea put forward by
Sarkozy.  It's very similar to the precautionary principle
championed by Greenpeace and other environmental groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precautionary principle is a moral and political principle
which states that if an action or policy might cause severe or
irreversible harm to the public, in the absence of a scientific
consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on
those who would advocate taking the action.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the precautionary principle is the route to
sustainable economies and a healthy planet for future generations. 
Applying it thoroughly would be a true revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 steps - join&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=sarkozy"&gt;Join the revolution by taking your own 7 steps.

	Scientific tests, arranged by Greenpeace, reveal that Apple's iPhone contains hazardous chemicals. The tests uncovered two types of hazardous substances, some of which have already been eliminated by other mobile phone makers.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Removed, the iPhone's screen detached from the battery and processors.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, due to our successful &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;
Green my Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; Steve Jobs, the boss of Apple, claimed:
"Apple is ahead of, or will soon be ahead of, most of its
competitors" on environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched closely when the iPhone was launched in June for any
mention of the green features of the phone from Apple. There was
none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we bought a new iPhone in June and sent it our Research
Laboratories in the UK. Analysis revealed that the iPhone contains
toxic brominated compounds (indicating the prescence of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#bfr"&gt;
brominated flame retardants&lt;/a&gt; (BFRs)) and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#pvc"&gt;
hazardous PVC&lt;/a&gt;. The findings are detailed in the report, "&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25275/iPhones-hazardous-chemicals.pdf"&gt;
Missed call: the iPhone's hazardous chemicals&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been thousands of media articles about the iPhone.
Few of them have discussed the phone's environmental credentials.
Check out our video of the disassembly of the iPhone and what the
tests revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent scientific laboratory tested 18 internal and
external components of the iPhone and confirmed the presence of
brominated compounds in half the samples, including in the phone's
antenna, in which they made up 10 percent of the total weight of
the flexible circuit board. A mixture of toxic phthalates was found
to make up 1.5 percent of the plastic (PVC) coating of the
headphone cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Steve Jobs has missed the call on making the iPhone his first
step towards greening Apple's products," said Zeina Alhajj,
Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "It seems that Apple is
far from leading the way for a green electronics industry as
competitors, like Nokia, already sell mobile phones free of
PVC".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Santillo, Senior Scientist at the Greenpeace Research
Laboratories, commented, "Two of the phthalate plasticisers found
at high levels in the headphone cable are classified in Europe as
'toxic to reproduction, category 2' because of their
long-recognised ability to interfere with sexual development in
mammals. While they are not prohibited in mobile phones, these
phthalates are banned from use in all toys or childcare articles
sold in Europe. Apple should eliminate the use of these chemicals
from its products range."&lt;/p&gt;

	Today, Greenpeace India activists scaled a 76 metre (250ft) smokestack spewing carbon dioxide at the Kolaghat coal fired power station, to paint the message "SMOKING KILLS". No, we're not talking about cigarettes - we're pointing the finger at one of the biggest causes of climate change - coal. [UPDATED]
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/greenpeace-painted-smoking-ki.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace painted "Smoking Kills" on the smoke stacks of the Kolaghat Thermal Power Station. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The addiction to coal fired power plants is a deadly one that
the Indian government needs to get away from immediately," said
Soumyabrata Rahut, Climate Campaigner Greenpeace India. "As in any
addiction, we will have to wean ourselves away from the bad habit
in a phased manner, but to continue on a carbonized growth path
will be suicidal not only for the health of the country but for the
entire planet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently 67 percent of India's total electricity is from coal
fired power plants, and additional proposed plants will lead to the
doubling of CO2 emissions from the power sector in India. This will
push India in to the third slot just behind USA and China from the
current fifth position in overall CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 12 October -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixvolunteers were arrested yesterday, were denied bail and
remain injail. They have been charged with criminal trespass and
violation ofthe West Bengal Maintenance of Public Order Act
of1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior arrived in Calcutta todaybearing the message

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 15 October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The six Greenpeace activists, four men and two women were
granted bail this afternoon. The next hearing of the case is
scheduled for December 19. (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/press/releases/greenpeace-climate-6-granted-c"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Saving energy - the other side of the issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace India is not only tackling climate change from the
supply side, they're also going after the demand side by calling
for a ban on energy wasting lightbulbs.  Earlier this week, they
used floating life rings create a massive 45 metre (150ft) 'BAN THE
BULB' message on the Hoogly river (also in Kolkata), and over
200,000 people have signed their ban the bulb petition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banning energy guzzling incandescent lightbulbs would cut
India's carbon dioxide emissions by a whopping 55 million tones.
It's a simple, quick and doable step that can lead to a four
percent cut in India's carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rainbow Warrior on the way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/about/ships/the-rainbow-warrior/"&gt;
Rainbow Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to arrive on the 12th of October
on its maiden voyage to Kolkata and the Sunderbans, to highlight
the extreme vulnerability of this ecologically sensitive region and
to sea level rise.  Watch the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india"&gt;Greenpeace India website&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 6th, during an investigation into pirate fishing in
WestAfrica - in which more than 100 vessels were documented - the
crew ofthe Esperanza spotted the "Binar 4" illegally
transshipping(transferring fish from multiple trawlers onto the
cargo ship) fishfrom Guinean waters. The Esperanza trailed the
pirate ship to theSpanish port of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands
where the fish were tobe laundered into the European market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Guinean authorities have confirmed this ship broke the law.
Wewill ensure that no further laws are broken before the
authorities inLas Palmas confiscate the stolen fish on board", said
Sarah Duthie,Greenpeace oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 11,000 boxes of fish are on the Binar 4, taken from
one ofthe poorest regions in the world. West Africa is the only
place on theplanet where fish consumption is actually falling. So
far, theauthorities in Las Palmas have refused to authorize the
offloading ofthe illegal catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are encouraged to see that Spain and Guinea have taken
actionagainst this vessel and we hope that this is the beginning of
a moreeffective cooperation to improve control of pirate fishing
vesselsattempting to enter Las Palmas", said Helene Bours of the
EnvironmentalJustice Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of Defending Our Oceans, Greenpeace and theEnvironmental

engaged in, or linked to illegal fishing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

	After a chase of over 1000 miles, a six day occupation and hours of diplomatic negotiations, Spain has finally agreed to declare the cargo from the "Binar 4'" - 200 tonnes of fish stolen from West Africa - illegal. Guinean officials also announced they would be fining the owners and operators of the pirate vessel.
&lt;div&gt;

            The last Greenpeace activists occupying the Pirate fishing vessel "Binar 4" in Las Palmas climb down after Spain agrees to declare the 200 tonnes of stolen fish onboard illegal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pirate-ship-boarded130406/"&gt;
branding the ship&lt;/a&gt; with "stolen fish", Greenpeace climbers
havecontinuously occupied the "Binar 4" in the notorious pirate
fishingport of Las Palmas for nearly 150 hours. When the
announcement was madethe last two activists descended to cheers
from the gathered crowd,tired but still smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the time the Esperanza was patrolling the waters of West
Africa,104 foreign flagged vessels, from Korea, China, Italy,
Liberia andBelize were documented. Nearly half were engaged in or
linked toillegal fishing activities. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pirate-ship-boarded130406/"&gt;
The "Binar 4" was taking fish from shipslicensed to fish&lt;/a&gt;, but
all the vessels involved had broken the lawsconcerning
transshipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In every ocean, every day fish are being stolen. That means
that allgovernments must act every day to combat it," said Sarah
Duthie ofGreenpeace. "We are delighted that the authorities have
taken actionagainst this illegal reefer, but this can only be the
beginning, notthe end. If Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice
Foundation had notacted then Spain would not have done anything to
stop this cargo beingsold across Europe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fining the Binar 4 sends a strong signal to other pirate
operators,but it is only a fraction of the humanitarian and
environmental cost,"said Helene Bours of the Environmental Justice
Foundation. "West Africadepends on fish for food and income, but it
is the only regional in theworld where consumption is falling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the High Seas Task Force on Illegal, Unreported
&amp;amp;Unregulated (IUU or pirate) fishing, up to 20% of the global
catch istaken illegally - as much as US$9 billion dollars.
Greenpeace and theEnvironmental Justice Foundation are working
together to expose thepirate fishing fleets that operate without
sanction across the globe.Together they are demanding that
governments close ports to banpirates, deny them access to markets
and prosecute companies supportingthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Keep up to date with the latest Oceans news and find out what you can do to help Defend Our Oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.com/donation/donate.php?theme=yil&amp;amp;appeal_id=198"&gt;By donating to Greenpeace you'll be helping protect the Ocean environments and the people who depend on them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Hazardous substances reduced but not eliminated from laptops</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hazardous-substances-laptops/</url><text>
	Our investigation into hazardous materials in laptops shows that manufacturers have phased out use of some of the most toxic materials over the past year but still have a long way to go in eliminating others, such as PVC, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and phthalates.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/laptop-motherboard-toxic-test.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/laptop-motherboard-toxic-test.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Motherboard of a laptop during testing for hazardous substances.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We purchased 18 laptops from Acer, Apple, Dell, HP, Sony and
Toshiba in 14 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia and sent
them for analysis by an independent laboratory and at our Exeter
Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, "Toxic chemicals in computers - Reloaded", show
bromine being present in over 40 percent of the components tested,
at concentrations of up to 10 percent by weight. Of the components
tested, Sony laptops were found to have the lowest number
containing bromine, Dell laptops had the highest number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PVC was found in 44 percent of all plastic coating internal
wires and external cables that were tested. Phthalates were found
in the power cables supplied with all laptops, with the highest
levels in those of Acer and HP laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new report follows up our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toxic-chemicals-in-computers/"&gt;
investigation into toxics in laptops&lt;/a&gt; sold in Europe in 2006,
before EU legislation on hazardous substances in electronic
equipment, known as RoHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the implementation of RoHS, computer manufacturers have
significantly reduced their use of lead, cadmium, mercury,
hexavalent chromium and certain brominated flame retardants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is these changes have been implemented by all
companies and not only for the European market where it is a
minimum legal requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows that, for almost every component found to
contain either bromine or plastic PVC, an equivalent component free
of these chemicals can be found in another laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First computer free of the worst toxic chemicals?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, by combining components from different machines, the
industry could already almost produce the first computer free of
the worst toxic chemicals. The question is, which company is going
to be the first to go the whole way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/greencomputerchallenge?MM_URL=laptoptestreport" class="act"&gt;Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While levels of certain toxic chemicals in the laptop
components tested do not exceed current European standards, other
hazardous chemicals found in laptops are not yet covered by
European regulations," said Zeina Alhajj, Greenpeace International
toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace's goal is for computer manufacturers to eliminate
the use of toxic materials completely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The results demonstrate that legislation in one region can have
an influence even in countries where it does not yet apply.
However, even where they do exist, current laws fail to regulate
all hazardous chemicals in laptops, or in other electrical
equipment, "said Dr. Kevin Brigden from the Greenpeace Research
Laboratories who oversaw the sampling analyses and produced the
report. "Laws which aim to protect human health and the environment
must ultimately address all hazardous substances," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who's making the most progress?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working since 2004 to push all the computer
companies mentioned in the report to eliminate the worst toxic
chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have all published plans to drop these chemicals in 2008/9
(with the exception of HP) from all their products. These plans
form part of the companies' scores in our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ranking guide also scores companies on whether they have
already computer models free of PVC and BFRs on the market. Based
on this criterion, out of the computer companies whose laptops we
tested, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-so-5/"&gt;
Sony&lt;/a&gt; scores highest followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-to-5/"&gt;
Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of this test, it seems Sony is closest to the goal
of eliminating toxic chemicals from computers. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-ap-5/"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt; is making progress since the last test but &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-de-5/"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-hp-5/"&gt;
HP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-ac-5/"&gt;
Acer&lt;/a&gt; still have the most work to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/greencomputerchallenge?MM_URL=laptoptestreport"&gt;You can keep the pressure up by writing to the CEO's of the top computer firms to challenge them to produce a greener computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=laptopdonate"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite.

<item><language>en</language><title>The "Rostock Pirates" exposed in Lithuania</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rostock-pirates-lithuania/</url><text>
	Just 24 hours after the Esperanza took part in the arrest of a pirate fishing vessel at sea off the coast of Guinea in West Africa, Greenpeace activists exposed twelve pirate fishing vessels in Lithuania -- including our old friends "The Rostock Girls". The hulls of the vessels were painted with the banner “Stop pirate fishing”. We are demanding that  Lithuania refuses blacklisted pirate vessels - and it looks like they are listening.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We catch up with the "Rostock Girls", pirate ships blacklisted for illegal fishing, in the port of Klaipedia, Lithuania.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This action is already the third against the very same trawlers.
You might remember our "Spanish chorus line" - we exposed the
blacklisted Georgian-flagged trawlers Eva, Isabella, Juanita and
Rosita in &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/halting-pirates/"&gt;
Rostock harbour earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, along with their sister-ship
Carmen as it tried to get service at the Polish shipyard in
Swinouscie earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talks with the Lithuanian fisheries inspectors, it seems
they are happy to have our help. We will be working with them, and
they have indicated that if our friend the Carmen approaches, she
won't get a warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port of Klaipeda currently hosts twelve vessels which have
been blacklisted by the EU, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries
Commission or Norway for involvement in illegal fishing. Klaipeda's
port is notorious for its poor feedback and registration system,
which enables pirate vessels and convenience-flagged ships to land
their illegally caught fish in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our oceans campaigner Truls Gulowsen said, "It is completely
unacceptable that EU member states like Lithuania violate EU law by
giving these pirate ships shelter, fuel, service and
assistance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Something fishy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a Swedish TV4 documentary in January a significant
proportion of the fishing in the Barents Sea is illegal and
unregistered with shady links to the Russian mafia and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/findus-fires-fishy-suppliers/"&gt;
Western fish product companies&lt;/a&gt;. Research carried out by
Greenpeace revealed that illegally caught cod sold by the companies
Kangamuit and Ocean Trawlers ended up on the European market in
well known supermarket chains and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Out of Africa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the demonstration took place in Klaipeda, the Esperanza
was due to arrive in the West African port of Conakry, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pirates-arrested/"&gt;
having escorted a pirate fishing vessel&lt;/a&gt; from the fishing
grounds back to shore. The captain of the pirate vessel admitted
his catch was being sent to Las Palmas - the fish laundering
capital of the world. The Lian Run is also part of a family of
vessels some of which fish illegally and some of which have been
abandoned out to sea off the coast of Guinea, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/zombie-ships/"&gt;leaving
crew on board rusting death traps for months on end&lt;/a&gt; waiting for
a supply ship for food and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ocean Defenders TV&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders-tv"&gt;Check out new footage of the Esperanza arresting pirates off the coast of Guinea, West Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            The Chinese pirate vessel Lian Run 14 is arrested after having been found fishing illegally inside the Guinean Exclusive Economy Zone EEZ.
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first light this morning, the Greenpeace helicopter flew over
agroup of fishing vessels 60 miles off the coast of Guinea. One was
noton the list of ships authorized to fish. An inflatable boat
waslaunched from the Greenpeace ship M.Y Esperanza, taking a
Guinean Navyofficer and a fisheries inspector with crew from
Greenpeace and theEnvironmental Justice Foundation on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After confirming the ship, the Lian Run No 14 - one of afamily
of Chinese vessels observed in the area - had no license, theship
was arrested. The Esperanza will now escort her to Conakry andhand
her over to officials on shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain of the Lian Run No 14 claimed documentation
waslodged in Las Palmas - the fish laundering capital of the world.
Inaddition, all the boxes being used to pack the stolen fish bore
thenames of other vessels, proving that even licensed vessels
collaboratewith the pirates to sell illegally caught fish on the
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish boxes with the names of seven other vessels were found
onboard the Lian Run No 14, proving how licensed vessels are
packingtheir boxes with illegal catch from the Lian Run No 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that they had boxes on board destined for Europe
andclaimed to be represented in Las Palmas shows a clear link
between thefood being stolen from Africa and the fish being served
on the dinnertables of Europe," said Helene Bours of the
Environmental JusticeFoundation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Pirate fishing: it ain't pretty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks, we may have seemed a bit quiet. But now
we cantell youwe've been working undercover with a team from the
human rights groupEnvironmentalJustice Foundation (EJF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in West African waters, we have unmasked a trail of
piratefishing and stolen food leading directly from Africa into
Europe andbeyond. In partnership  with the Environmental Justice
Foundation, wehave unmasked 61 pirate vessels that are stealing
food from a poorcountry that is losing millions of dollars a year
in stolen fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From on board the Esperanza, we havedocumented 61
foreign-flagged vessels in the waters of West Africa. Ofthese, 19
had been involved in illegal fishing activities in the past.An
additional 21 could not be identified, as their names were
hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Guinean enforcement officials, with powers of arrest,
havenow joined the Esperanza, which will continue to carry out
surveillanceoperations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five unidentified vessels were spotted in waters inside
theGuinean 12 milezone - waters reserved for local fishermen. Local
fishermen simplycannot compete with these pirate ships. They have
been forced, often inunstable canoes, to fish further and further
from shore. Collisions arenot uncommon. Legitimate local fishermen
have died while the piratescontinue to steam further inshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also witnessed an illegal transfer of fish from
twovessels to a largerefrigerated vessel, or reefer. (Guinea
outlawed such transhipmentslast year.) Transhipping is one of the
major ways in which piratefishing fleets hide their catches and
launder them through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=5,0,0,0" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="480" width="430"&gt;  &lt;param value="/international/PageFiles/25394/slideshow14.swf" name="movie"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West Africa is the only region in the world where
fishconsumption is falling. According to an estimate from the the
UKDepartment for International Development, cash and food starved
nationslike Guinea are losing US$100 million each year in stolen
fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, pirate fishing is worth billions of USdollars a
year - 20 percent of the total fish catch. It is estimatedthat just
in sub-Saharan Africa it nets US$1billion dollars annually,while in
the waters of the Southern Ocean, up to 50 percent of thevaluable
Patagonian Toothfish may come from illegal activities. In theBaltic
Sea 40 percent of the cod caught in 2002 - 2003 was estimated
tohave been illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that pirate fishing is devastating to oceanlife
and the livelihood of some of the world's poorest people, notenough
is being done to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helene Bours of the EJF said, "It is complete hypocrisy for
governments to talk aboutencouraging aid to Africa at the same time
as allowing the food and income theyneed to be stolen."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Oceans Campaigner onboard, Sarah Duthie, said the
solutionmust come from governments taking action such as closing
ports topirate fishing vessels and making sure companies are
prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us to ensure that governments stop just talking about
pirates and workactively to &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;make piracy
history&lt;/a&gt; - sign up now as an Ocean Defender.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Ending the days of plunder: halting the pirates</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/halting-pirates/</url><text>
	Blacklisted trawlers, swapping flags and changing names… but they couldn’t plunder the high seas today.  In the German harbour of Rostock, four pirate fishing boats awoke to find themselves hemmed in by chains and oil drums.  One is now displaying not just a new flag, but a new banner reading “Stop pirate fishing”, courtesy of Greenpeace activists. A fifth trawler escaped in the night.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/3/greenpeace-activists-prevented.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/3/greenpeace-activists-prevented.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists prevent four pirate fishing trawlers from leaving Rostock harbour. The ships were involved in the collapse of redfish stocks in the North Atlantic in 2005.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've already called on the German government in the past to
preventthese same fishing vessels leaving port. Back in December
last year,they were called the Oyra, Ostroe, Okhotino, Olchan and
Ostrovets. In2005, they were involved in the collapse of the
redfish stocks of theNorth Atlantic. Now their owners have changed
the ships' registrationsand they're named like a Spanish chorus
line: Eva, Junita, Rosita,Isabella and Carmen, and are registered
to a new flag state: Georgia.But the German government didn't stop
them setting out again, so wedid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea Cederquist, marine biologist at Greenpeace Germany,says
the fact that the German government allows known pirate
fishingvessels to set sail is incredible. "Knowing these ships are
leavingport without making sure they will keep to international
fisheryagreements in future is unacceptable," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Box blue"&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - The One That Didn't GetAway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under cover of darkness, the fifth vessel inthe blacklisted fleet sneakedaway to Poland. Our activists have paid a visit to the Carmen, in the portof Swinoujscie, wrappingit in chains and hanging a banner that reads "Stop PirateFishing".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TheCarmen is currently in dry dock, presumably in preparation for anotherbout of pirate fishing. As in Germany, where the sister vessels wereillegally re-supplied, the Polish government are so far ignoring theirobligation to prevent the Carmen from re-supplying, despite its beingblacklisted for repeated breaches of European, north east and northwest Atlantic fishing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have obtained information indicating that these trawlers have
settheir sights on either plundering the rich fishing waters off
the coastof West Africa (Mauritania) or going farther afield to
trawl the depthsof the Pacific. Both are regions where proper
controls are lacking andpirate fishing is flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
Pirate fisheries&lt;/a&gt;are estimated to cost countries between 3.4 and
7.6 billion euros eachyear. They also wipe-out the unknown worlds
of the deep-sea. Manypirate vessels are engaged in a fishing
technique called &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/bottom-trawling/"&gt;
bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;which is known to cause huge destruction to
vulnerable deep-sea marinelife such as cold water corals. Over the
next few months, inpartnership with the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/bottom-trawling/" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Justice Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,our ship the
Esperanza will expose how fishing pirates in the Atlanticare wiping
out marine life and destroying the livelihoods of thecommunities
dependent on our oceans for food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what needs to be done to stop this? Our Oceans Campaigner
SariTolvanen thinks governments should put their money where their
mouth is- and now. "They need to stop these boats from leaving port
and supporta United Nations moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling. This wouldsend a signal to pirates that their days of
plundering the oceans areover," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a signal to governments everywhere and &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;sign up as
an Ocean Defender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=HaltingPirates"&gt;Help us stop more pirate fishing and convince governments to act to bring about a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The inflatable boats have been hauled in.  The crew is exhausted, the ships need fuel, and it's time to take the campaign to save the whales from the high seas to the High Street, (or from the bounding main to the Main street, if you're North American).

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            44 activists from the Greenpeace ships Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise spell out a personal appeal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists like Texas, Andrew, Lally, Nathan, Mikey, Phil and all
theother folks you've come to know through the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Oceans Defenders
weblog&lt;/a&gt;have done all they can.  They've saved whales. 
They'veslowed down the hunt.  They've alerted millions of people
aroundthe world to the whale killing they've witnessed in the
SouthernOcean.  Now it's up to all of us to act on what
they'veshown us -- and finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've spent 61 days at sea, half of them in front of
theharpoons.  We've broken and fixed every boat we have at
leastonce.  We've been rammed. We've had explosive harpoons fired
overour heads.  Our activists have risked their lives in the
freezingAntarctic waters and spent their holiday season away from
family andloved ones for the chance to save a whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a message from expedition leader Shane Rattenbury, to you
oceandefenders and all who have been part of this exciting campaign
for thelast few months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Logistically we cannot remain in the Southern Ocean any longer, but this certainly isn't the last you'll hear of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The 57 crew on both Greenpeace ships want to thank everyone who hassupported our work down here by writing letters of support tonewspapers and websites, and also to thank our millions of individualfinancial supporters around the world. It's thanks to our new fastership, the Esperanza, that we were able to keep up with the whalers thewhole time, and we couldn't be down here without that support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;For a month now we have dogged, delayed and disrupted the whaling fleetin the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and have no doubt that they havefallen far behind in their bid to slaughter 935 minke whales and 10endangered fin whales. It is our hope that this struggle will inspirepeople to help us defend whales, so that it goes down in history as thelast time the peaceful silence in the Sanctuary is broken by the soundof a grenade-tipped harpoon.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
Whaling is not just the concern of governments and cryptic
politicalmeetings. There is big business involved. While whaling is
notprofitable, you might be surprised to learn of some famous
seafoodcompanies' connections to whaling. We're asking you to help
us make thewhaling stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies outside Japan are owned by, or have contracts
with,Nissui,  the corporation which owns one third of Kyodo
Senpaku,which owns the whalingfleet.  We aim to  expose exactly how
whalers profit from thefish you buy, and demand  those companies
disassociate themselvesfrom whaling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissui need to know that whaling is bad forbusiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up as an &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Ocean
Defender&lt;/a&gt;, we'll sendyou ongoing information about who these 
companies are and how youcan pressure them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/a-victory-for-the-whales130106/"&gt;
Already in Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, activists have convinced a popular
seafoodcompany  to cancel contracts with Nissui corporation. 
Injust 2  days over 21,000 cyberactivists contacted the company
anddownloaded  stickers to place on Santa Elena products
insupermarkets, to highlight  that the company was implicated in
thekilling of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, we've hit &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
whaler-owned seafood giant Gorton&lt;/a&gt;s with nearly  40,000 letters
from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2008266"&gt;
Europe, Nissui&lt;/a&gt; is being hammered with pressure to use
itsone-third  ownership of Kyodo Senpaku to pressure for a shut
downof the whaling fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we continue to pressure those targets, we're opening
anew front with &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/campaigns/oceans/sealord-and-whaling.asp"&gt;
Sealord&lt;/a&gt;, a New Zealand-based fishing company thatis 50% owned
by Nissui.  Sealord sells toseafood  distributors all over the
world, and we'll be targettingproducts that  whalers profit from
wherever they're sold. You can &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/action/email-sealord.asp"&gt;send a
message&lt;/a&gt; to Sealord now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Need a reminder of what we're asking you to oppose?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Are sustainable, legal fisheries the latest trend in the frozen food section of your supermarket?  Industry authority Intrafish certainly thinks so.  Not only have several supermarket chains and frozen seafood companies started to scrutinize where their fish is coming from, but in the Pacific four companies were recently fined for illegal fishing - a good step toward Making Piracy History.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists scale the Swedish headquarters of frozen food giant Findus after a documentary exposed their dealings with illegal fisheries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.intrafish.no/global/" target="_blank"&gt;Intrafish&lt;/a&gt; reported recently that
Europeansupermarket giant Asda, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?CFID=3485438&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=49507146&amp;amp;ucidparam=20060117140500&amp;amp;MenuPoint=H-A" target="_blank"&gt;after we protested on their
rooftops&lt;/a&gt;,droppedskate, Dover sole, ling and dogfish from its
shelves, and pledged todevelop a sustainable seafood policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish frozen food firm Findus dropped one of their suppliers
afterthe firm was &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/findus-fires-fishy-suppliers/"&gt;
linked with illegal cod fishing&lt;/a&gt; As part of the samecontroversy,
Scandinavian retailers initiated audits of suppliers,including
Espersen (which supplies, for example, McDonald's in manyEuropean
countries), to determine if illegal cod was getting into
theirproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. retailers Sainsbury's, Coop, Tesco, Somerfield, Waitrose
andMorrisons have all delisted suspicious species, in some cases
includingthe very vulnerable big-eye tuna. Intrafish's verdict:
"There's beeneven more shifts and sustainability pledges that could
easily be linkedto this trend. My guess? We've only just
begun."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in March the UK Government announced new funding of about
US$1million to help support an international initiative to deal
with piratefishing. Meanwhile in the Pacific, France, Australia and
New Zealandsigned a declaration on maritime surveillance in a bid
to strengthenthe fight against piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team leader in Fiji, Nilesh Goundar, was
enthusiastic.  "Hopefully we should see the benefits of practical
help provided toPacifc Island countries who, because of resource
contraints andcompeting development priorities, could not allocate
sufficientresources to deal with the plague of pirate fishing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, three foreign boat captains were fined
US$102,564 for illegally fishing off Clipperton Island, a
Frenchpossession, and a Fiji based company was fined $30,000 for
allowing aforeign vessel to illegally fish in Fiji waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have our friends at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons/sealord"&gt;
Sealord&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
Gorton's&lt;/a&gt;caught on to the trend of responsible, sustainable
fisheries? Well Sealord CEO Doug MacKay was on New Zealand radio
last monthoffering to "be the middleman" between us and Nissui, and
the BostonGlobe reported a Gorton's spokesperson saying "Gorton's
has stronglyencouraged Nissui to use whatever influence they have
to appeal to theJapanese government to stop whaling… We have also
asked them to severany connections they might have with the
Japanese government's whalingprogram."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these few signs mean that someone is doing the right
thing,Nissui's refusal to give an inch means that Gorton's and
Sealord remaintied to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;
Japan'scommercial whaling operation&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
piratefishing&lt;/a&gt; still accounts for 20 percent of the global
catch,netting the illegal fishermen and their company bosses
somewherebetween US$4-9 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If governments are really serious about making piracy history
then theyneed to act on a grand scale, working together to protect
the high seasand coastal communities from those pirate companies
who think nothingabout stealing food from others and smuggling them
onto the market. Youcan send that message loud and clear by &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;signing up

	Our Argentine Ocean Defenders have hit Nissui in their pockets. Nissui own about one third of Kyodo Senpaku -- the people who run the Japanese whaling fleet. Our cyberactivists have convinced a major Nissui client in Argentina not to buy from a corporation involved in the killing of whales.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Despite the continued killing of whales by Japan there was some good news for whales when a Argentine seafood company canceled a contract with Nissui, a Japanese corporation involved in whaling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as directly confronting the whaling fleet in the
Southern Oceanwe have been exposing howmany well-known companies
are linked to corporations involved inwhaling. Internationally we
have been &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/our-oceans/whaling/gortons"&gt;focussing
on Gorton's&lt;/a&gt;,but in Argentina the focus is on companies that do
business with one ofthe corporations most closely linked to whaling
in Japan, Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissui has Argentine subsidiaries that operate freezer trawlers,
one ofwhich is a surimi (type of minced fish) processor, which is
sold inArgentina, Uruguay and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="story" item_id="298576"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular seafood company in Argentina, Pesquera Santa Elena was
usingNissui fish in its products. So we targeted Santa Elena to ask
them tostop buying from Nissui and make it clear that whaling is
bad forbusiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just 2 days over 21,000 cyberactivists contacted the company
anddownloaded stickers to place on Santa Elena products in super
markets,to highlight that the company was implicated in the killing
of whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably quickly the president of Santa Elena was sitting at
thetable with us to negotiate. Faced with the possible damage to
thecompanies public image from being linked to whaling it was
anapparently easy decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Greenpeace Argentina got a signed commitment from
thepresident of Santa Elena not to buy any more surimi from Nissui.
Thecompany even committed to donate about US$60,000 to an
organisationworking on whale conservation if they ever violate the
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one big client less for Nissui, and we are pressing other
companiesto follow suit. Maybe Gorton's can learn from Santa
Elena's goodexample? In Argentina we are now focussing on other
companies that buyfrom Nissui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=1217756"&gt;Stand up to make a difference for the whales - Tell Gorton's and Nissui that their customers do not support whaling!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=argentinavictory"&gt;We rely on individual donations to fund our work challenging the whalers on the high seas and their corporate backers in the world of commerce. Give today to help save whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Whalers ram Greenpeace ship</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/whalers-ram-ship-111/</url><text>
	This morning our ship the Arctic Sunrise was deliberately rammed and damaged by the Nisshin Maru, the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet. Straight after the ramming, the Nisshin Maru began to steam away from the "scene of the crime". However both the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza are in pursuit with every intention of continuing to peacefully protest the hunt.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/1/damage-to-the-bow-of-the-green-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Damage to the bow of the Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise following a collision with the factory ship of the Japanese whaling fleet, Nisshin Maru. The Nisshin Maru cut across the bow of the Arctic Sunrise, causing the collision. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking from onboard the Arctic Sunrise, expedition leader
ShaneRattenbury said, "There is no way to describe this as anything
but adeliberate ramming which placed the safety of our ship and the
lives ofour crew in severe danger." The Nisshin Maru is more than
twice as longand six times heavier than the Arctic Sunrise. The
impact has left theSunrise "battered and bruised" but luckily no
crew members were injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/whalers_ram_greenpeace"&gt;All the
details here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight the Nisshin Maru had been offloading accumulated whale
meatontoa supply vessel and early this morning our activists, in
inflatables,began to paint the words "whale meat from sanctuary" on
the side of thesupply ship. This action in no way impeded the
transfer of the meat andthe tiny inflatables did not represent a
threat to either vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the activists completed painting the slogan, the Nisshin
Marusuddenlydisengaged from the supply vessel coming around a full
360 degreesbeforemaking for the Arctic Sunrise, which was about a
kilometre away, andstriking it on the port side. The captain of the
Sunrise tried to pullout of the way of the oncoming whaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on December 21, when the catcher ship the Kyo Maru bumped
theEsperanza, the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR)
said "thesame thing occurred five years ago when in 1999 another
collisionoccurred between Japan's research vessels and a Greenpeace
vessel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was the Nisshin Maru, not the Arctic Sunrise, which
was atfault for the collision in December 1999 also, as officially
recordedin the Lloyd's database (the international record of
maritime movementsand casualties). International maritime law
states that "any vesselovertaking any other shall keep out of the
way of the vessel beingovertaken."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Watch video of the incident:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="collision" align="middle" height="200" width="300"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have repeatedly informed the whaling fleet and its
controllingorganisation in Tokyo, the Institute for Cetacean
Research, of our peacefulintentions and explained the purpose of
the protest against the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the ramming, we are not going to be deterred. "No
amount ofbullying or intimidation will prevent us from defending
the whales, norfrom broadcasting images of the kills to the world,"
said Shane.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Costs of Bayer GE rice scandal could exceed 1.2 billion USD</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bayer-rice-scandal071106/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace activists in India take action with Farmers' Union to say no to GE Rice &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When an unapproved genetically engineered (GE) crop was discovered in American rice last year, it triggered the biggest marketing and financial disaster in the history of the US rice industry. We commissioned an independent economist to do some maths; he found that total costs could exceed USD$1.2 billion.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace and Bharatiya Kisan Farmers Union unfurl a giant banner in a rice field 25 km from Lucknow, protesting against any genetically engineered rice field trials in the region. " src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/lucknow-india.jpg" alt="Greenpeace and Bharatiya Kisan Farmers Union unfurl a giant banner in a rice field 25 km from Lucknow, protesting against any genetically engineered rice field trials in the region. " width="450" height="306"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2006, traces of the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer-cropscience-contaminates/"&gt; uncertified GE crop LL601&lt;/a&gt;, known as "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/health-risks-bayer-s-genetica/"&gt;Liberty Link&lt;/a&gt;" and owned by biotech giant Bayer were found in US rice supplies. 63 percent of US rice exports were affected, the contamination spread to at least 30 countries, from Austria to Ghana to United Arab Emirates.  Major importers such as the EU and the Philippines &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/world-s-largest-rice-company-h/"&gt; closed their markets&lt;/a&gt; to US rice. Up to US $253 million was lost from food product recalls, and future export losses could reach $445 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Contamination came from field trials &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is particularly scary is that Liberty Link was never even grown commercially. The contamination was the result of experimental trials, which ended in 2001 - five years before the contamination was discovered. In a desperate attempt to lessen the damage after the scandal broke, the US government decided to approve the rice strain.  It didn't work; as the report shows, the US rice industry is still reeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, an even bigger rice exporter than the US, is the new battleground for GE crops. The Indian government is preparing to start field trials next month. Greenpeace urges them not to make the same mistakes as the US, and to stop all plans for GE experimental trials. Greenpeace India took action with the Bharatiya Kisan Farmers Union today. They visited one of the 12 areas approved for GE rice trials, and with a giant banner reading "Save our Rice" sent the Indian government a clear message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Greenpeace GE campaigner Doreen Stabinsky says: "There is only one way for the rice industry to protect itself from another billion dollar debacle and that is to prevent GE rice from ever being grown."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bayer attempts to blame God &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of US farmers and European businesses have filed lawsuits against Bayer in attempts to recoup their losses. Punitive or statutory damages which may be awarded against Bayer may double or even treble the final cost of the GE contamination incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer's response to the disaster, which has destroyed the livelihoods of thousands of people, from growers to producers to sellers, was to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/act-of-god-060207/"&gt; blame God&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, they claimed that the contamination scandal was probably caused by "an Act of God." Even by biotech industry standards, this is beyond grotesque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;India, don’t make the same mistakes as the US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, the pro-GE government, its regulators and companies such as Monsanto are preparing to start field trials of damaging GE crops next month. The decision ignores the will of farmers and traders and even the Indian Supreme court, which ruled in August that no new field trial approvals could happen until a full court hearing takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision also threatens the Indian basmati rice industry, which is committed to remaining GE free.  Many of the planned GE field trials will take place right next to where basmati is grown, and as genes do not understand political boundaries basmati and non-basmati rice types will face serious danger of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If their rice gets contaminated, it is Indian farmers, traders and millers whose livelihoods could be destroyed. India and the rest of the world must learn the lessons from the US disaster. The only way to ensure crops are safe from contamination is to ensure that GE crops do not exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate vessel found in Suva harbour</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirates-in-suva/</url><text>
	UPDATED 29 October: The plot thickens! Here's a tip: When painting a new name on your blacklisted pirate fishing vessel, go someplace further than five minutes walking distance from a Greenpeace office.While on port watch duty, Greenpeace activist Josua Turaganivalu photographed a ship in Suva harbour going by the name of Mahkoia Abadi, but on closer inspection found it was really the Wen Teng No 688 - a known pirate fishing ship blacklisted under IATTC. Four days later, Josua noticed crew members painting a different name on the ship.

            Crew of the fishing vessel changing its name from "Mahkoia Abadi".  This ship is blacklisted by IATTC under the name, "Wen Teng No 688".

&lt;p&gt;The plot thickens on this suspect vessel berthed in Fiji's
Suvaharbour. The ship came into the country under a Taiwanese flag
andchanged to an Indonesian flag when it berthed at Suva. But,
accordingto the Indonesian ambassador in Fiji, it is not an
Indonesian ship. Theembassy is investigating and the ship is
grounded until further notice.Says Greenpeace oceans campaigner,
Nilesh Goundar, "Now that theIndonesian government has disclaimed
the ship as one of its country'sfishing vessel, it is confirmation
that it is a pirate ship."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renaming, using false names, changing their flag state, and
switching areas are all common tactics used by pirate fishing
vessels to confuse authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, a second suspect fishing vessel, belonging to the
same company, but not registered with the Fisheries Forum Agency,
was docked next to the Wen Teng. Unregistered ships will sometimes
fish anyway - transferring their catch to a registered ship, or a
refrigerator ship, to avoid regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josua quickly notified the rest in the Greenpeace Suva office,
we got the authorities involved, and the Wen Teng has been
detained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rampant piracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing is rampant in this
part of the world. Our ship, the Esperanza has spent the past weeks
working with local authorities in two Pacific Island countries to
hunt for pirate fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspectors from the Federated States of Micronesia and Kiribati
and Greenpeace boarded vessels that were consistently failing to
report through their vessel monitoring systems (VMS). Some had
almost certainly been transhipping at sea, making it impossible to
monitor or regulate the size of their catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Lagi Toribau, said while onboard the
Esperanza, "Foreign fishing fleets take advantage of the Pacific's
lack of resources in order to run amok. Kiribati has just one small
patrol boat to cover over three million square miles. Pirate
vessels are cheating Pacific Island people of income and food."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The real problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pirate fishing aggravates overfishing, which in the Pacific has
led to two key tuna stocks Bigeye and Yellowfin being in serious
trouble. Unless drastic action is taken to reduce fishing effort
they could face commercial extinction within three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nilesh Goundar co-ordinated the Pacific Island's leg of
Defending Our Oceans.  He emphasizes that it is time flag states
make greater efforts to deter and prevent pirate fishing on high
seas registered to their flag. According to Nilesh, "The Flag of
Convenience (FOC) system is very inexpensive and often a deliberate
means for fishing vessels on the high seas to evade the rules and
make enormous profits.  The oceans are being plundered and we must
defend it to the hilt."&lt;/p&gt;

	Port authorities here are taking action against five of the most notorious pirate fishing ships in Europe. When our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, arrived yesterday, we presented a dossier of evidence against this pirate fleet.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A notorious pirate fishing fleet in the harbour of Svetly in Kaliningrad. The ships are  blacklisted by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Russia is now doing what other countries should have done a
long time ago," said Frode Pleym, one of our oceans campaigners on
board the Arctic Sunrise. "By detaining the pirate fleet Russia is
setting an important precedent in terms of making illegal fishing
history, an example that other countries must follow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A year of ill gotten plunder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this fleet the "Rostock pirates", after a harbour in
Germany where we first confronted them.  The five ships in the
fleet are:  Rosita (formerly Okhotino), Carmen (formerly
Ostrovets), Eva (formerly Oyra), Juanita (formerly Ostroe) and
Isabella (formerly Olchan).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has tracked these vessels for over a year. In that
time they have been re-named and re-flagged after being blacklisted
by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries
Committee (NEAFC).  They operated under a Dominican flag, then were
re-flagged to Georgia.  Changing names and flags is a common tactic
for dodgy ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What other countries aren't doing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the "Rostock pirates" have been re-supplied
in Germany, Poland and Norway - all signatories to the NEAFC
agreement, which closes blacklisted ships to members' ports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia is promising action we have no intention of taking
the pressure off other countries who should have, and must act
against pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this morning we filed an official complaint with the EU
Commission, demanding it enforce Community fisheries law, which
Germany violated after officials assisted the pirate fleet during
their stay in Rostock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meanwhile, back on the high seas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has shown that, if they are enforced, existing laws and
international agreements can help stop pirate fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But, the majority of the high seas remain largely unregulated
by such agreements," said Pleym. "This needs to stop. The world's
governments have a chance to take the first step by establishing a
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling at the United Nations this
week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/2006/10/victory_russia_acts_on_trawler.html"&gt;Arctic Sunrise crew weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	During two months of joint surveillance with enforcement officials from two countries we've patrolled over 30,000 square miles of ocean.  In that time we’ve inspected 8 suspicious fishing vessels, found a warehouse full of de-finned shark carcases and spent a night fishing on a Longliner .  The situation in the Pacific is different to what we'd been expecting.   The pirate fishing here is much more subtle  than in West Africa. There are no rusting unlicensed vessels with demoralised crews fishing surreptitiously.  Instead, each of the vessels we’ve inspected has been in good condition, the crew well fed and in good spirits.  Nonetheless they are pirates, operating in a grey area between the legal loopholes and lax governance.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Dawn breaking over deck of a Korean longliner, the 'Shin Yung 51'. Yellow Fin and Big Eye tuna stocks are destined to be critically overfished within three years if the fishing of the two fish species continues unabated.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective fisheries management relies on up-to-date accurate
estimatesof the size of the target fish population, knowledge of
the fishesbiology, history of the fish stock and detailed knowledge
of thetechnology that has been used to find the fish.  Only then
can thescientists model the fish population accurately and have a
chance ofestimating how many target fish can be caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Effective management and enforcement is key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004 the first step in effective Pacific tuna fisheries
managementwas taken with the establishment of the Tuna Commission
(WCPFC).  Tunafish are highly migratory, and obviously do not
restrict themselves tothe territorial waters of any one country. 
The Tuna Commission isa step forward because they  manage the tuna
as one fish stock eventhough it ranges over the territorial waters
of  multiple countries and the HighSeas (the parts of the ocean
that are not under the jurisdiction of anycountry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25340/a-schoolgirl-from-pohnpei-disp.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Aschool girl stands in front of the Tuna Commission building in Pohnpeiwith tins of Skipjack - the only tuna we could find on the island. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Tuna Commission most countries licensedtheir waters
with no regard for the licensing arrangements of theirneighbours. 
Many of the Pacific Island Countries were in factcompeting to
provide distant fishing nations with the cheapest possiblelicensing
agreements.  Good for the distant fishing nations, badfor
sustainable fisheries management - and ultimately the PacificIsland
Countries relying on the tuna fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a practical level it is impossible for the Tuna Commission to
managethe fishery until it has accurate, timely data on the size
and healthof each tuna species' population.   At the most basic
level alllicences should be based on tonnage of fish caught - not
time spent atsea, as was the case with the vessels we boarded. 
Moreover,licences need to be strictly enforced.  We came across
vesselswhose licences had lapsed - but these were renewed without
penalty via aphone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is compounded by the fact that the vessels'
activities areonly partially regulated.  The Vessel Monitoring
System (VMS) thatis required by all vessels fishing in the
territorial waters of TunaCommission's member countries proved to
be unreliable.  Allvessels had the system installed but it did not
work consistently due toa &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/10/a_box_of_tricks.html"&gt;
number of loopholes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;&lt;span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'&gt;Bait and switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second problem in the regulation of fishing surrounds
thetransfer of fish to a larger factory vessel (reefer) - a process
calledtranshipping.   When done in port or in a country's
waters(EEZ) transhipping requires a licence for each transhipment
and ismonitored. This enables the Commission to record how much
fish has beencaught.  To avoid the licence costs and the costs
incurred ingoing to port many vessels tranship on the high seas. 
Currently,for Longliners, this is NOT illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing these governance and legal loopholes is not
rocketscience.  All that's needed is agreement from all members of
theTuna Commission and some money to set up and enforce the system.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25340/the-near-empty-hold-of-the-kor.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Thenear empty hold of the Korean Longliner 'Dong Won 117'.  The vessel hasbeen at sea for thirteen months without making any port calls, callinginto doubt the captains claims that the vessel has not made anytrans-shipments since it left its home port of Busan, Republic of Korea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transhipmentis further aided by lax regulations around
refuelling andresupplying (bunkering) at sea.  Most Pacific Island
Countriesallow vessels to bunker in their territorial waters and
there is noregulation around bunkering on the high seas.  If
bunkering at seais banned, vessels would need to go to port every
month - making iteasier for authorities to monitor their catches.
This would alsoprovide revenue for the host Pacific Island Country
in terms of portfees and resupply contracts. Currently this revenue
resides with thedistant fishing nations that supply the bunker
vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The costs of piracy and underpayment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money would not be an issue if distant fishing nations
recognised thatlicence fees need to reflect both the market value
of the fish and thecost of protecting the fishery. When this is the
case Pacific IslandCountries, most of which rely heavily on fishing
licenses for revenue,can collectively demand fair license fees. At
the moment the licencefees reflect neither the value of the fish
nor the cost of protectingthe fishery. In the Pacific up to US$400
million worth of fish isstolen by pirate fishing each year, more
than 4 times what the regionearns in licences.  This is much more a
reflection on the low costof licences that the extent of pirate
fishing in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these loopholes closed the reporting of all catch
figures(including all transhipments) and estimates of the size of
the tuna populationswill be greatly improved.  This would allow the
Tuna Commission toset realistic catch quotas for the tuna stocks. 
The quotas are likelyto be substantially lower than the
free-for-all allowed by the currenttime based licensing system.
However, if the Pacific tuna are to besaved from imminent
commercial extinction then this step must be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Next steps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December Greenpeace will be taking the findings of this
expeditionto the Tuna Commission's annual meeting.  We will be
recommendingmeasures that ensure all catch figures are reported,
that loopholes in the VMS are closed and that all transhipments and
bunkering atsea be outlawed.&lt;/p&gt;

            Linda, 21, a sexworker who says she spends days and nights on visiting purse seiners in the Tarawa harbour. Kiribati may be breaching international conventions on child protection since many of the sexworkers are only 14 and 15 years of age.   
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deck of the Taiwanese purse-seiner bustles with activity. At
anchor a few kilometres off Tarawa in Kiribati, tons of skipjack
tuna are lifted from a refrigerated hold up onto the sweltering
topdeck for transhipment to a ship moored beside it. Whistles blow,
nets of shimmering fish are raised and swung onto the mothership,
which will take its cargo to canneries in Papua New Guinea and
Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look closer and another small transhipment is also taking
place between the two rolling boats. A young girl is gingerly
easing herself down thick ropes from the mothership onto the
purse-seiner. It is a delicate balancing act 20 metres above water
and for a moment she looks like a trapeze artist, walking the
tightrope. She smiles at one of the Taiwanese crew as she drops
like a cat onto the deck and disappears into a nearby cabin. Here
in Kiribati she is known as a "korakorea" girl; a girl who spends
time with fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Not as romantic as it seems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific, the practice of sweet young girls paddling out
to foreign boats to introduce their charms to restless seamen is
nothing new, it is almost a cliché of Pacific history. European
sailors were fond of dropping anchor in places like Tahiti knowing
they would be "warmly welcomed" after long and lonely months at
sea. Such women helped cause mutiny on the Bounty, and much else to
inspire romantic notions in Europe that the Pacific islands were an
Eden of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the practice continues today, there is little romance
and far more dangers involved for the girls - the spectre of AIDS
and social/psychological consequences of girls as young as 12
involved gives the fishing industry a dark side that is rarely
contemplated when consumers open a tin of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, there are growing social consequences as a result of
a rapacious fishing industry worth an estimated US$2.7 billion per
year. More than half the world's tuna, about 2 million tons per
year, now comes from the Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why the world is coming to the Pacific for fish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific ocean holds the world's last great fish supply -
since many of the world's oceans have been substantially overfished
in recent decades. The EU, after enforcing a moratorium on cod
fishing in the Atlantic which put much of the European fleet on dry
dock, has recently signed a number of bi-lateral deals with Pacific
island states to fish in their waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe now sources much of its tuna from the Pacific - in
Germany, for example, half the tuna consumed there comes from
Kiribati alone. The EU fleet now joins China, Taiwan, Japan,
Russia, America, The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and others
who are ranging far into the Pacific, often unmonitored, to harvest
schools of fish (mainly tuna) on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Korakorea girls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25343/a-mother-and-her-child-wait-fo.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;As in most places, prostitution is
hardly a modern phenomenon.  In Kiribati, the term "korakorea" was
first coined to describe local girls who went aboard Korean fishing
vessels, but is now more generally used for girls going onboard
fishing boats from any country as well as being slang for "cheap
fish".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many do it because of poverty at home and the chance to earn
money, clothes and fish to take home. Some girls get pressured by
their families to do it. Others claim they do it so they can get
"drinking money for their friends" and because the foreign
fishermen treat them better than their local men do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no law against prostitution in Kiribati, which was
highlighted recently when 80 girls were rounded up and brought
before a local court before being released. Yet there is growing
concern that Kiribati maybe breaching international conventions on
child protection since many of the girls are only 14 and 15 years
of age. UNICEF is preparing to release a damning document relating
to underage prostitution in several Pacific countries, including
Kiribati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Kathy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One girl involved in the trade, "Kathy", claims girls as young
as 12 are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I know about one 12 year old girl who was taken out to a
fishing boat by her aunty and she has disappeared. Her family are
very worried since she has been missing now for 4 months".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy is a pretty 21 year old girl who lives with her father, an
unemployed former government worker, in a crowded settlement near
the Betio port on south Tarawa. She claims there are many local
girls involved in the trade and they all have different
motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It all depends because some they really need money to support
their families with food, so they feel some pressure. Other girls
need money to buy drinks for themselves and friends when they want
to go out to the bars".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy says that even though their have been crackdowns by local
authorities the girls are not scared of getting caught by police
because "their family are supporting them".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Taking advantage of history and attitudes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25343/baby-slum.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;This is what makes prostitution in
Kiribati and other Pacific islands a complex issue. For many
Pacific cultures it is not a big deal; sex, custom and fishing are
all intertwined, subject to tabus. Many islanders do not view such
exchanges as "prostitution". Fishing and sex have long been linked
to traditions that were, in itself, not necessarily a bad thing,
because everything was shared within communities and remote islands
needed "new blood" to prevent inbreeding and keep the tribe strong
to defend from raiding enemies. Ritual exchanges of things like
fish and women kept the peace among neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kiribati, as a recent UNICEF document points out,
prostitution is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In 1826 prostitutes were referred to as Nikiranroro, meaning
those who had lost their virginity or had eloped. Whalers were much
criticised and blamed for having increased prostitution in the
islands...and that venereal disease was said to have been more
widespread after whaling contacts".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Modern times&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25343/kiribati-dance.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;As President of the Kiribati National
Council of Women (AMAK), Mere agrees the korakorea issue is a
complex one, but believes that young girls should be in school and
better guided by their parents or guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is an issue here because it is against our culture and
tradition. In the olden days, at age 14 or 15, girls were kept in
the home doing work that assured your future life as a woman and
they were very restricted in their night time outings. But now
Kiribati is in the swell of globalisation and the issue of
korakorea...well, that's how things happen now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernity, a cash economy and the loss of tradition has created
new vulnerabilities for coastal communities of the Pacific. Legal
and illegal fishing by foreign vessels have introduced a range of
social problems apart from the environmental impact of depleted
fish stocks. Mere believes there is a "dangerous cycle" linking
alcohol abuse, violence, sexual abuse and disease that is
afflicting many Pacific nations including her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities that once shared everything now find a new rich/poor
divide is splitting them and AIDS is an ever present danger.
According to the HIV AIDS clinic at Tarawa General Hospital,
Kiribati (population 92,000) has 43 confirmed AIDS cases of which
26 have already died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'd say almost all the cases of AIDS here are related to the
fishing industry" claims one of the nurses testing blood samples.
"It is coming from both foreign fishermen and our own sailors
returning home".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;More enforcement tools needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25343/linda-taiwan-boat.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;David Yee Ting, Kiribati's Permanent
Secretary for Fisheries, claims that the government is getting on
top of the situation, saying, "Our new Police Commissioner has been
enforcing the laws to stop girls - and those who help them - go out
to the boats."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He confirms that the situation got so bad that for a period in
2003, Kiribati actually banned all Korean fishing boats from
entering Kiribati ports after reports in the Korean Herald that
30-50 girls, mostly underage, were servicing the Korean
fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he thought Kiribati was also getting ripped off on
its core asset, fisheries, Ting says "That's a bit harsh, but yes,
we could be getting a better return. We only have one patrol boat
and we don't have many trained fisheries officers who can be
stationed on boats to monitor catches."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But as Pacific states come together through regional bodies
like the FFA (Forum Fisheries Authority, based in Solomon Islands)
and the WCPFC (Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission,
based in Marshall Islands), I believe we will have more collective
power to get a better deal on our fish resources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ting is upbeat about the recent deal signed between the EU and
Kiribati, believing the EU will help develop the local industry
with more local employment and training. Other observers are not so
sanguine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we should have vessels from 5,000 miles away
fishing here. Why are they fishing here? Because they have stuffed
their own region and now they are coming down here to do it" is the
blunt assessment of Captain David Lucas, manager of Solander
Pacific Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've got purse-seiners from the European Union fishing in
Kiribati. Why should they be down here? What have they done to
their own? Who's next?"&lt;/p&gt;

	A surprise from the shores of Guimaras was brought to the doorsteps of Petron corporation’s headquarters in Makati City. Activists delivered a drum of spilt bunker fuel, highlighting the company's lack of urgency in retrieving the remaining fuel which continues to seep from the tanker chartered by the oil giant, which sank earlier this year.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace surprised Petron Corporation, when activists delivered a container drum of spilt bunker oil.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drum was hand-carried by Greenpeace activists who wore
protective gear used for handling hazardous materials. In Petron's
courtyard, Greenpeace volunteers laid down a banner with a replica
of Petron's logo and the words "Petron, stop the spill now!". The
banner was trod on by three other activists who left black
footprints leading to Petron's door, in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dragging their feet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our campaigner in South East Asia, Beau Baconguis, explains
why.  "From the start, Petron's response to the spill has been
extremely disappointing - initially they even shunned
responsibility for the spill," she said.  "Up to now, they have
failed to take urgent action on the pressing need to retrieve the
rest of the sunken oil. Were Petron genuinely concerned about the
well-being of Guimaras, its unfortunate residents, and the
environment, they would have guaranteed the costs to immediately
initiate the retrieval operation."&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/photosvideos/photos/in-a-surprise-protest-action"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25344/in-a-surprise-protest-action.jpg" alt="Activists deliver bunker oil to Petron" hspace="3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sixty days later&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems Petron is trying to distance itself from financial
responsibilities associated with the retrieval effort.  The company
has been more preoccupied in downplaying the extreme urgency of the
situation.  It is now 60 days after the oil spill, and the
responsible parties are still vacillating over the question of
money-with little thought to the dangers the excruciating wait
continues to pose on the environment and the well-being of people
in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Every day that passes means more bunker fuel leaks into the sea and onto unfortunate coastal villages."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the government, retrieval of the oil now depends on
whether the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) will
approve the compensation of the siphoning of the oil from the
sunken vessel. But the IOPC is not set to make a decision until
October 23. Even if approved, retrieval is expected to begin only
in December. Meanwhile, every day that passes means more bunker
fuel leaks into the sea and onto unfortunate coastal villages. The
contamination and suffering, as well as the health and
environmental risks continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/photosvideos/photos/in-a-surprise-protest-action-2"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25344/in-a-surprise-protest-action-2.jpg" alt="Activists trample the banner to lead black footprints to oil giant Petron's door" hspace="3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on Petron to hasten the retrieval of the oil by
guaranteeing the expected costs. Petron should also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately intensify relief operations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;commit to paying for the continuing clean up, rehabilitation,
and monitoring of the area, and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;compensate the communities for the lost incomes since August
11, for up to at least 1 full year after the oil has been removed
from underwater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If Petron thinks they can rest easy after their much-hyped cleanup... they can think again"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is no time to be protecting profits yet again to the
detriment of human health and the environment," Beau adds. "If
Petron thinks that they can now rest easy because of their
much-hyped clean-up, which in fact does little to address the
problem, they can think again. As long the source of Petron's oil
remains underwater, no PR blitz can erase the trail of destruction
that leads to their doorsteps." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action as an Ocean Defender&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/defenders?MM_URL=petron"&gt;Sign up as an Ocean Defender - it's free!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Birds Eye/Iglo still linked to illegal fishing</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/birds-eye-iglo-still-linked-to/</url><text>
	Last week the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCE) met in Dublin to discuss how the industry would handle the increasing amount of illegal cod ending up in our burgers and fishsticks.  The good news: they made some promising recommendations.  The bad news: these are only "guidelines", and not binding. Two of the biggest brands – Birds Eye and Iglo – have remained silent in public about their commitment to these guidelines.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/9/baltic-cod-ica.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/9/baltic-cod-ica.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist labels Baltic cod "STOLEN FISH" in a Swedish ICA supermarket. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines that AIPCE came up with were strangely familiar,
being pretty similar to our own recommendations.  However, they
only applied to Barents Sea cod and not Baltic Sea cod, which, as
we reported last month, is up to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/baltic-sea/"&gt;30
percent illegally caught&lt;/a&gt;.  The guidelines are also very
general, nevertheless they are a good first step and deserve to be
widely implemented. (If you're really keen you can &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/AIPCE"&gt;download
the AIPCE guidelines here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Ocean Defenders have recently asked the number one
frozen food brands in Europe, Birds Eye and Iglo, to make a public
statement on how &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;they&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would avoid pirate fish in their products before the Dublin
meeting. So far, they have remained silent.  Birds Eye and Iglo are
in the process of being sold to a company called Permira, so they
are in the limelight right now as the industry waits for the sale
to be finalised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Captain Birdseye strikes back&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in response to all this publicity, a debate has been
waged on the industry news website &lt;a href="http://www.intrafish.no/" target="_blank"&gt;Intrafish&lt;/a&gt;.  The
site summarised a letter from Unilever, current owners of Birds Eye
and Iglo, in response to our recent actions involving Ocean
Defenders:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unilever felt comfortable purchasing from the [Baltic] region,
given European Commission proposals that fishing continue there,
and added that withdrawing for (sic) fishing in that area would
increase the pressures in other fisheries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our oceans campaigner in Norway, Truls Gulowsen, was pretty
shocked at that statement.  Truls explains, "I hope I have
misunderstood. Do Iglo and Birds Eye really claim to continue to
source cod from the depleted Eastern Baltic, until its possible
collapse, as a measure to protect other fish stocks? Or is this
just another piece of marketing work trying to confuse the
audience?"&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Truls also pointed out that while the European Commission did
indeed propose that fishing continued in the Baltic Sea, this was
against all scientific advice including from their &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scientific advisory body!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Don't call us, we'll call you&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birds Eye and Iglo also said in their statement that while they
would like to meet with us, "the future leadership of Permira's
frozen food business[...]is not yet finally designated, so we
cannot guarantee their presence."  The Unilever letter added that
no decision on Permira leadership would be made before the
beginning of November, although the new CEO has been named.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"'We assume in the meantime...our brands would not continue to
be targetedin public by your organization [Greenpeace] on these
issues,' Unilever said."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We disagree - we think consumers have the right to know what is
ending up in their seafood, and what the brands they are buying
stand for - right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mega fish fingers – 100 percent fish, 30 percent illegal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, it's quite strange that apparently no decisions can be
made before November (and more meetings), but yesterday Birds Eye
announced a new product - Captain Birdseye Fish Finger Megas, a
product aimed at "reinvigorating" the fish finger brand. So it
seems it's business as usual at Birds Eye, at least on some
fronts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intrafish reported: "The new product uses a larger 100-percent
fillet, and a healthier coating, aimed at reinforcing the notion
that Birds Eye is increasing the quality of its products, and
bringing 'new and lapsed consumers to the brand'. "&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'd like to know what exactly that "100-percent fillet" is.  Is
it 100 percent legal cod? We doubt it.  We also would like to know
that Birds Eye is increasing the quality of their products - but in
our case, that means a public statement on how they and Iglo will
take real, concrete steps to ensure that pirate fish doesn't end up
in your Mega Fish Finger.  Otherwise there may be a lot more of
those lapsed consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;Tell Birds Eye and Iglo that you would like to know (and now!) how they will tackle illegal fish in their products. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Last week it was 37°C in Sydney and 19°C in London.  I’ve lived in both cities.  Sydney’s 33° south of the equator, London’s 51° north. These temperatures are unseasonably warm for both cities and that's wrong. When it’s hot in Sydney it should be cold in London, and vice versa. That’s supposed to be part of the fun of having two homes. Anyone who thinks climate change isn’t real, or isn’t significant or that it won’t radically alter their lifestyle needs their head examined.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A low lying Pacific island.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week we sailed past a couple of the atolls in the
GilbertIslands.  They were just over 10 miles away, but were so low
andflat, they didn't look like land at all, just wrinkles in the
horizon.Their fate has been sealed by our addiction to fossil
fuels.  Thebillions of tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the
atmosphere everyyear are adversely impacting the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates
theaverage global temperature will have increased by 6 degrees
by2100.  This may not  sound like much but the phrase
'averageglobal temperature' conceals a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average global temperatureduring the last ice-age, when ice
sheets covered most of Scandinavia,reached as far south as northern
Germany and covered most of Canada theUpper Midwest and New England
in America, was only 6 degrees lower thantoday's average global
temperature.  Even a small change hassignificant effects on the
world's weather systems, oceans andecology.  Four effects of
climate change will have massive impactson the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Sea level rise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most widely publicised effects of climate change is
anincrease in sea levels. Current estimates predict an increase in
sealevel of around 1.5 - 3 mm per year. This doesn't sound so bad,
and theIPCC conservatively predict that by 2100, global warming
will lead to asea level rise of  110 to 880 mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the ice sheets of Greenland and the Antarctic melt
then the sea level is expected to rise by a more drastic 68.3 m.
 No one knows whether these ice sheets will melt entirely but a
2005British Antarctic Survey found 87% of the Antarctic Peninsula
glaciershave retreated over the past 50 years.  In the past five
years,the glaciers have lost an average of 50 metres (164 feet) per
year. A&lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/greenland-glacier-melt/"&gt;
Greenpeace expedition to Greenland&lt;/a&gt; last year found  the Arctic
tobe in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of any sea level rise for the Pacific are
enormous.Rising sea levels will smother islands wholesale, drowning
mangrovesand coral reefs. The Gilbert Islands that we passed last
week are partof Kiribati, a country with a population of just over
105,000 peoplescattered amongst 33 low lying atolls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest point in thecountry is only 81 metres high and is on
the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/10/banabas_discarded_jewel_o.html"&gt;
decimated island ofBanaba&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kiribati people have a good deal comparedto their neighbours
in Tuvalu. There the population of just under12,000 people is
clustered on 9 atolls. The highest point is 5 metresabove sea
level.  When you add the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/king-tide-pummels-kiribati/"&gt;
effect of storms and high tides&lt;/a&gt;to the increase in sea level
most of the atolls of Tuvalu and Kribatiwill become uninhabitable.
Tuvalu already has a deal with the NewZealand government for all
its inhabitants to move there when theirhomes are drowned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25341/mangroves-of-pohnpei-fsm.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mangroves serve as nurseries to juvenile reef and pelagic fish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangroves may just look like muddy swamps but they are of
vitalimportance to island communities and marine ecosystems. 
Theyprovide communities with food; protect the coastline from the
sea, andserve as nurseries for many juvenile reef and open water
ocean marinespecies. The United Nations estimates that &lt;a href="http://www.unep.org/PDF//mangrove-report.pdf"&gt;13% of
mangroves will be drowned by 2100&lt;/a&gt;. Many Pacific Island
countries, including Samoa and Fiji, are expectedto lose half of
their mangroves; this is likely to have a devastatingeffect on
local communities and ocean ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Changes in ocean temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is warming the oceans. Changes in ocean
temperature willalter the distribution, migration routes and
breeding cycles of marineorganisms. For example, Albacore tuna
exhibit a strong preference forwaters between 16°C and 21°C,
whereas Yellowfin tuna only spawn in waterabove 25.5°C. Other
organisms, such as oysters, rely on thetemperature of the
environment to determine their sex.  Astemperatures increase these
creatures will have to alter their range,adapt or die. Their
decreasing population sizes, a result ofoverfishing, will also
reduce their ability to adapt to the rapidlychanging
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When temperatures increase coral bleaching occurs.  What wecall
coral is actually two co-dependent organisms, a coral polyp and
analgae, which live symbiotically. The algae photosynthesise
providingthe coralpolyp with nutrients while the coral provides the
algae with a safe andnurturing environment.  Temperature increases
cause the coralpolyp to expel the symbiotic algae, this causes the
coral to lose it'scolour (hence the term bleaching). If the coral
does not re-establishits relationship with the algae (or another
species of algae) it soondies.  A recent report suggests that &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn10068-most-corals-unable-to-adapt-to-warming-oceans.html"&gt;
three quarters of the world's coral reefs may suffer from climate
change related bleaching&lt;/a&gt;.  Some experts have gone so far as to
predict that &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4707"&gt;Australia's
Great Barrier Reef will lose 95% of its living coral by
2050&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Changes in weather patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceanic currents pump nutrients from the ocean floor to the
lightsub-surface waters, where they are used by phytoplankon. These
are avital part of ocean ecosystems. Salinity changes in
differentparts of the ocean, primarily caused by differences in
rainfall (e.g.El Nino/El Nina in the Pacific) or melting glaciers
(e.g. the Gulfstream in Atlantic) drive these currents. Climate
change is alteringthese patterns of rainfall and glacial melt, and
these alterations willinevitably change the magnitude, locations,
directions and seasonalityof these life-giving currents. A 2005
study, predicted that changes inocean currents caused by global
warming will reduce the supply ofnutrients, slashing the oceans'
productivity by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate modelling suggests that weather patterns will alter,
becomingmore extreme.  This is expected to result in more severe
storms,meaning severe weather events, such as hurricane Katrina,
whichdestroyed New Orleans, will become the norm.  In addition
tofloods, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19125714.400-changing-storms-increase-coastal-erosion.html"&gt;
changing storm patterns are expected to increase coastal
erosion&lt;/a&gt;  -  further exacerbating the effects of sea level
rises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ocean acidification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A less well known effect of climate change is ocean
acidification. Ouroceans are, and have been for millions of years,
slightlyalkaline.  Some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
dissolves inthe ocean forming a weak acid (carbonic acid).  As the
volume ofcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases so too does the
amountdissolving in the sea. Carbonic acid's handiwork can be seen
in manylimestone caves. It is the leeching of carbonic acid through
thelimestone that results in the formation of the most
fantasticstalactites and stalagmites. Its work in the ocean will be
much moredestructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25341/colourful-reef-fishes-clownfi.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coral reefs arevulnerable to climate change induced bleaching, ocean acidification andsea level rises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As the oceans acidify, marine organisms with calcium carbonate
in theirinternal skeletons (bones) and shells will be in trouble. 
At themoment their skeletons and shells are hard because the upper
layers ofthe oceans are supersaturated with calcium carbonate. As
the oceansacidify this concentration will be reduced.  This
meanstheir  shells and skeletons will become softer and, if the
level ofacidification becomes too high, their shells and skeletons
will startto dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will have massive impacts all over the marineecosystem.  It
will cause huge changes to the species compositionof the oceans
because key organisms at the bottom of the food web,critically some
phytoplanktons and most zooplankton, will no longer beable to
survive.  Different species of plankton form the basis ofnearly
all  ocean food chains.  Further disruptions willoccur because the
corals that create the structure and provide nichesfor an array of
marine ecosystems will also be unable to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2003 study calculated that increasing fossil carbon dioxide in
theoceans, could make them more acidic over the next few centuries
thanthey have been for 300 million years, excepting some rare
catastrophicevents.  A2005 study into such events showed that 55
million years ago, a releaseof 4500 gigatons of carbon caused the
extinction of huge numbers ofdeep-sea creatures. It took over
100,000 years for the oceans to returntotheir normal alkalinity. 
To put that time frame into perspective,&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Homo Sapiens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  - us - have been around for between only200,000  - 400,000
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is to be done?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all very depressing both for marine organisms and on a
moreselfish level, for us.  Overfishing and destructive fishing
hasalready impoverished most marine ecosystems, and left them
particularlyvulnerable to environmental changes.  The rapid changes
that humaninduced climate change will bring about will exacerbate
the problems wehave already caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change, overfishing and destructive fishing are more
than justpersonal responsibilities.  Their causes are endemic to
oureconomic and social structures.  These issues need to be
tackledon by every government, industry, corporation and
individual. Thenumber of collapsed fisheries around the world are a
dire warning toanyone thinking that politicians, self-interested
regulatory bodies andcorporations are an effective way to make
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be overwhelmed by the problems, there are still things we
can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk, cycle or take public transport&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Only fly when necessary&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;
Reduce your personal power consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reduce your consumption of fish and seafood&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/fun-stuff/e-cards/pacific-tuna-school"&gt;
Spread the word about over fishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	At around 3pm yesterday afternoon the team on the bridge of the Esperanza spotted a vessel on the horizon.  By 4pm we could see it was a Korean longliner, the Dong Won 117.  There are two fisheries enforcement officials from the Pacific Island of Kiribati onboard with us, and we went out with them to check out the boat. Richella King, our web editor on board the Esperanza, reports on what happened next and the shady world of Dong Won Industries.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Campaigner Lagi Toribau and Kiribati Law Enforcement Officer Taremon Korere in discussion with Captain Park Si-Joeng of the suspect Korean longliner 'Dong Won 117'. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Dong Won 117 is licensed to fish in Kiribati waters
theDong Won fleet is notorious for operating on the wrong side of
the law.Dong Won ships have been sighted acting illegally
throughout theEastern Pacific numerous times. We thought the ship
was worth a routineinspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dong Won 117 lived up to it's reputation on at least four
counts.  First, in what is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/dodgy-and-dodgier-pirate-fish/"&gt;
becoming characteristic of legal ships in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;,the Dong
Wong 117 has been reporting intermittently through it's
VesselMonitoring System (VMS).  The system allows the Foreign
FisheriesAssociation (FFA) and individual countries to monitor
fishing ships inthe Pacific region.  The FFA told the Dong Won
117's owners theirsystem was faulty, only last week.  Because of
this she shouldhave headed straight to the nearest port to get it
fixed, and phoned toreport her position every day until she got
there.  The Dong Won117 failed to do this, so there is no record of
where she has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly,her last recorded port of call was Busan, Korea, 13
months ago. Typically Longliners can stay at sea for between 3 to 4
weeks beforethey need to resupply.  Informal chat between our crew
and theirsshowed they had not been in port for a very long time -
the first andmost pressing bit of information needed was about who
won the World Cup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inorder to stay out at sea, the longliner must have been
resupplied by a'bunker' ship.  Bunkering is only legal if the
supply ship islicensed and each transaction documented.  Needless
to say theDong Won 117 hardly had any documents; the ones it did
showed it tohave bunkered with another boat with dodgy
reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even moresuspicious than sporadic reporting and patchy paperwork
was the lack offish.  If a longliner of Dong Won's size had been
fishing for 13consecutive months it should have run out of hold
space some timeago.  Instead her 300 ton hold was barely more than
halffull.  This suggests she was transhipping - offloading catch
atsea, a mostly illegal practice which fishing boats use to
avoidofficial monitoring or scrutiny of their hauls.  Because it is
soeasy for ships to launder their catches this way, we are calling
for aglobal ban on transhippping anywhere other than in port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterthe inspection we stayed with the Dong Won 117 through the
night,waiting for the Kiribati marine authorities' patrol boat
toarrive.  Early in the morning the Dong Won 117 hauled in her
linesand made a break for the high seas.  Orders to stop were
ignoredand she steamed off at high seas, very suspicious
behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheDong Won 117 is owned by a large Korean corporation, Dong
WonIndustries.  In addition to owning a fishing fleet Dong Won owns
distribution and logistics companies. Dong Won's stock price
islisted as a healthy US$54.  Kirbati, in contrast, is a
nationwhose gross domestic product per person is a mere US$800. 
DongWon has large ships, while Kirabati authorities have only one
boat topatrol their 3 million square miles of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems stems from the fact that Korea as a country
ispaying pathetic license fees.  In 2004 Korea paid Kiribati
US$3.1million for 135 longliners to fish in Kiribati. That amounts
to aboutUS$23,000 per vessel, the equivalent of about 23 tons of
skipjacktuna.  In the case of longliners they are after tuna with a
muchhigher value, so the amount of tuna they have to catch to earn
backtheir license fee is really a lot smaller.  For Kiribati it is
ofcourse a lot of money, but for Korea and her businesses it is a
veryfavourable investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help us make piracy history&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action/stop-stolen-baltic-cod"&gt;On the other side of the planet more pirate fishing is occurring - help us to stop the money trail and ask Birds Eye and Iglo to stop buying illegal fish!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Read the weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;More updates from the Esperanza in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Shark finning mystery</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/shark-fin-mystery/</url><text>
	This photo was taken in a warehouse less than 100 metres from where the Esperanza had been docked.  While most of the team had been busy on official Defending Our Oceans business, Alex had come across evidence of a lucrative shark finning operation.  Maarten and I joined him and we spent the remaining two and a half hours in Pohnpei trying to unravel what was going on. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna." src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/10/a-refrigerated-warehouse-in-po.jpg" alt="A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna." width="600" height="404"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei, FSM. To the left is a pile of finless shark carcasses, to the right a moonfish. In the background are frozen yellow fin tuna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerated warehouses in harbours are not unusual. Nor are piles of dead fish waiting for export. What was strange was the pile of frozen finless shark carcasses. Sharks are frequently an 'incidental' catch of the tuna fishing industry. Such sharks are termed 'bycatch', and for an incidental catch they're good luck. While the body of the shark is worth almost nothing, sets of shark fins sell for US$700 per Kg. That is 70 times the value of a kilo of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An expensive, tasteless tonic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fins are dried and sold for use in shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese dish which sells for upwards of US$100 a bowl. Hong Kong is the centre of the shark fin industry with 70% of the world's shark fins ending up there. As the Chinese economy improves demand for sharks' fins is increasing by 5% a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal shark finning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fishing boats with limited holds and long times at sea, shark carcasses are a waste of space. Sharks caught as bycatch can be legally stripped of their fins - so the bodies can be stored in a smaller space, and the valuable fins dried fresh while still at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Illegal shark finning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuse occurs when sharks are specifically targeted, their fins removed and their bodies thrown back into the sea. This practice, known as shark finning, is barbaric and wasteful. Often the shark is still alive, while its fins are hacked off with a sharp knife,leaving it in agony. The shark's finless body is then dumped overboard and, being unable to swim, it drowns or dies of starvation. Although shark meat is low value compared to its fins, it is still edible and its liver and skin are highly prized in certain parts of the world. Shark finning targets only 2-5% of the shark's body mass and wastes the remaining 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shark finning around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shark finning has been banned in the European Union since 2003, and is illegal in the US and Eastern Pacific. However, there are some serious loopholes in the legislation. The amount of sharks caught incidentally varies according to fishing method and circumstance. So, it is impossible to determine exactly how many sharks have been caught unintentionally. For Longline fishing vessels - which set a lineup to 100km long, baited with up to 3,000 hooks - incidental catch ranges from almost nothing to around 20%. For Purse-seiners 40-50% is typical. When fishing vessels come into ports such as Pohnpei, they must show their logbooks - a record how much of each fish species they have caught - to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the weight of shark carcasses is within the expected range for the fishing method, the haul is assumed to be incidental bycatch. A further loophole surrounds the issue of the fins being cut from the shark's carcass. Obviously, there should only be one set of fins per carcass. However, the assessment is made by weight, not number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Determining whether the finning is legal or illegal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight of the fins as a proportion of body weight varies between different species of shark. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimate shark fins comprise, on average, 2% of body weight. This means one would expect 20kg of shark fin for every ton of shark carcass. The US allows up to 5% total shark weight to be fins - this means that for sharks with a low fin to body weight, more than one shark could be illegally finned and dumped for each declared shark. Earlier this week the European parliament rejected a call by its Fisheries Committee to increase the EU's legal ratio of fins to carcasses form 5 to 6.5%. This would have allowed more than two-thirds of sharks caught to be undeclared - opening a back door to the shark finning industry. The European Parliament is now calling instead for a decrease in the ratio to a scientifically acceptable 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story in Pohnpei&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refrigerated warehouse in Pohnpei belonged to a Hong Kong based company called Luen Thai. In addition to over 60 finned shark carcases,the warehouse contained a few hundred frozen yellowfin tuna, 6 marlin and 2 moonfish. I spoke to one of the workers, who told me that the company runs 13 Longliners. Each stays at sea for about 3 weeks, catches around 300 tons of tuna and in the process 2 tons of shark. The products section of Luen Thai's website lists four species of tuna and eleven commercially valuable species of fish that are presumably frequently caught as bycatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25349/shark-fins-dry-on-the-deck-of.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mystery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal shark fining is brutal, but no more so than commercial fishing and with incidental catch rates of 0.67% it has little commercial value. Moreover, shark carcasses reek and are almost worthless - so, why keep over 60 of them in a refrigerated warehouse on the harbour front? Curiosity got the better of us, so we asked the guys working there what they were going to do with the sharks. Initially no one could come up with an answer, then they said the carcasses were going overseas somewhere, perhaps to be made into fish balls. With transport costs being as high as they are this didn't seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Maarten turned up with the video camera, the managers had arrived. They explained that the freezer was broken and that they planned to move the sharks. This made no sense, if the freezer in the warehouse was broken, why not rescue the high value tuna, moonfish and blue marlin? Instead the men set to work shifting over sixty worthless shark carcasses to a refrigerated van. The extreme responses to our cameras, suggest another motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the shark carcasses be resident incidental bycatch, always available to counted against fins caught illegally? Perhaps the 2 tons of shark was a reference to the weight of fins collected, and not total weight. This is not so unusual. Earlier this year twoSpanish Longliners landed 8 tons of shark fins in Suva, Fiji. With an estimated value of US $5.6 million this far exceeds the value of the tuna they would have caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexpected impacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal shark finning has a detrimental impact on ocean ecosystems; sometimes with a direct impact on fish stocks. Many sharks are top predators and as such their eating habits keep the structure and species composition of marine ecosystems in balance. Removal of sharks from an ecosystem can have complicated and unexpected results. For example, it has been found that the removal of tiger sharks from a tropical ecosystem resulted in a decline in the tuna population. The decline was because the sharks had kept populations of other predators of tuna in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradicating shark finning is humane, beneficial for sharks, for fisheries management and for all of us who depend on the health of our oceans. It is yet another example of the needless waste of ocean life, and the need for properly enforced marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Palm oil: Cooking the Climate</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/palm-oil_cooking-the-climate/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Once you pop, you can't stop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If, as you read this, you're tucking into a KitKat or dipping into a tube of Pringles, you might be interested to know that these products contain palm oil that is linked to the destruction of forests and peatlands in Indonesia. As our new report "How the palm oil industry is cooking the climate" shows, it's a recipe for disaster.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/palm-oil-plantation.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/11/palm-oil-plantation.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The sharp contrast between the pristine rainforest and the area destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations in Indonesia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturers of these products - Nestlé, Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble, and Unilever - are sourcing their palm oil from suppliers
who aren't picky about where they site their plantations. As the
volunteers at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/indonesia-forest-defenders-cam/"&gt;
Forest Defenders Camp in Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; have seen, this includes
tearing up areas of pristine forest then draining and burning the
peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's peatlands act as huge carbon stores so replacing
them with plantations them not only threatens the amazing
biodiversity, including the rare Sumatran tiger, it also releases
huge volumes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. They only
cover 0.1 per cent of the land on Earth, but thanks in part to the
activities of the palm oil industry they contribute 4 per cent to
global emissions. If expansion of the palm oil industry continues
unabated, that figure can only rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is a little unnerving as the three companies mentioned
above are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),
a group of retailers, manufacturers and suppliers who also include
multinational suppliers Cargill and ADM. The aim of the group is to
create clear standards for producing sustainable palm oil but at
present those standards are far too weak to ensure that forests and
peatlands are not destroyed to meet growing demand for palm
oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have more information about the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/palm-oil"&gt;problems with
palm oil&lt;/a&gt;, and if you still have questions try the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/faq-palm-oil-forests-and-climate-change"&gt;
palm oil FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. We will be asking retailers and food companies to
stop trading with those suppliers who are trashing the forests and
peatlands of Indonesia, and when that happens we will be asking for
your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Global problem, Global solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's to be done? The Indonesian government should urgently
introduce a moratorium on forest and peatland destruction, which
will provide a chance to develop long-term solutions and prevent
further emissions from deforestation. And our eyes are fixed firmly
on the UN climate meeting in Bali next month, where the next phase
of the Kyoto Protocol will be discussed. With deforestation
accounting for up to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/forests-and-climate-up-in-smok/"&gt;
a fifth of global emissions&lt;/a&gt;, including financing for forest
protection as a core part of the plan to tackle climate change is
essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At next month's UN climate conference in Bali, political
leaders must wake up to the fact that we need to make deep cuts in
greenhouse gas emissions, and make them fast," said Pat Venditti,
head of Greenpeace International's Forest Campaign. "Protecting
peatlands and other forest areas from destruction is one of the
most simple, cost-effective insurance options against global
warming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international scientific consensus on climate change is that
avoiding the worst impacts of climate change demands global warming
be kept as far as possible below 2 degrees Celsius. Emissions of
greenhouse gases need to have peaked globally by 2015 and then
begin a rapid decline.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need governments meeting in Bali to agree to negotiate a new
funding mechanism to protect the world's remaining tropical forests
as a critical component of the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol.
The resulting reductions in emissions from deforestation must be
additional to cuts in emissions from burning fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blog updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/blog?MM_URL=palmoil-cooking"&gt;Read updates from our activists at the Forest Defenders Camp in Indonesia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=palmoil-cooking"&gt;Greenpeace exists thanks to individual donors.

	Port authorities here are taking action against five of the most notorious pirate fishing ships in Europe. When our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, arrived yesterday, we presented a dossier of evidence against this pirate fleet.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/10/rostock-girls-1.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/10/rostock-girls-1.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A notorious pirate fishing fleet in the harbour of Svetly in Kaliningrad. The ships are  blacklisted by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee (NEAFC). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Russia is now doing what other countries should have done a
long time ago," said Frode Pleym, one of our oceans campaigners on
board the Arctic Sunrise. "By detaining the pirate fleet Russia is
setting an important precedent in terms of making illegal fishing
history, an example that other countries must follow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A year of ill gotten plunder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this fleet the "Rostock pirates", after a harbour in
Germany where we first confronted them.  The five ships in the
fleet are:  Rosita (formerly Okhotino), Carmen (formerly
Ostrovets), Eva (formerly Oyra), Juanita (formerly Ostroe) and
Isabella (formerly Olchan).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has tracked these vessels for over a year. In that
time they have been re-named and re-flagged after being blacklisted
by the European Union, Iceland and North East Atlantic Fisheries
Committee (NEAFC).  They operated under a Dominican flag, then were
re-flagged to Georgia.  Changing names and flags is a common tactic
for dodgy ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What other countries aren't doing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the "Rostock pirates" have been re-supplied
in Germany, Poland and Norway - all signatories to the NEAFC
agreement, which closes blacklisted ships to members' ports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia is promising action we have no intention of taking
the pressure off other countries who should have, and must act
against pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this morning we filed an official complaint with the EU
Commission, demanding it enforce Community fisheries law, which
Germany violated after officials assisted the pirate fleet during
their stay in Rostock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meanwhile, back on the high seas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has shown that, if they are enforced, existing laws and
international agreements can help stop pirate fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But, the majority of the high seas remain largely unregulated
by such agreements," said Pleym. "This needs to stop. The world's
governments have a chance to take the first step by establishing a
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling at the United Nations this
week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arctic Sunrise weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/2006/10/victory_russia_acts_on_trawler.html"&gt;Arctic Sunrise crew weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Eight of Europe's largest and most influential seafood companies, including McDonald's and Bird's Eye, are demanding better controls on pirate fishing in the Barents sea.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists take direct action to halt North Sea trawlers fishing cod towards extinction. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirate fishing is estimated to take approximately 25 percent of
the global fish catch annually. It's a  lucrative business worth
some US$9 billion a year. In the Barents Sea, it's estimated that
one in every five cod landed are caught illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the Norwegian government, the seafood majors
commit to adhere to voluntary industry guidelines adopted by the
European Fish Processors and Traders Association last September.
The guidelines were drawn up to avoid Illegal, Unregulated and
Unreported (IUU) Barents Sea cod and haddock. They also include a
commitment to refuse all fish from vessels blacklisted by Norway or
relevant regional fisheries management organizations like the North
East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;For Cod's sake, take action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the companies are also demanding tighter regulations to
ensure that the fish they buy are not illegal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 25px"&gt;An up-to-date
black-list with updated vessel information, clear legal standards
for listing and transparent criteria for de-listing would be a
valuable component of this effort. We therefore urge you to ensure
that a better list is created, that we and our suppliers can use to
ensure we are not purchasing from vessels fishing illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;We understand that avoiding fish from
black-listed vessels is part of the solution necessary to reduce
illegal fishing in the Barents Sea cod fishery. However going
forward we feel that the use of a "white list", or list of vessels
that are proven to operate legally, may mid to long term provide a
more comprehensive way to help eliminate illegal fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signatories include some of Europe's largest seafood
processors and purchasers such as restaurant chain McDonald's as
well as Espersen, Royal Greenland, Youngs Seafood and Iglo/Birds
Eye, Frosta/Copack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of action by the corporate sector which we
need.  Other seafood purchasers need to follow suit and make clear
commitments to avoid fish from blacklisted vessels as soon as
possible.  And the governments responsible for blacklisting vessels
need to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Norwegian Fisheries Directorate has not yet
published any of the Russian ships that were documented in illegal
and unreported activities in 2005 and 2006. As a result, fish
buyers have no official warning to avoid fish from these ships.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Greenpeace Blacklist: doing a job governments should
do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's part of the reason we've launched &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/"&gt;our own blacklist&lt;/a&gt; and
have &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/the-expedition/news/fishy-cod"&gt;
taken action against pirate fishing vessels&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/press-centre/press-releases/greenpeace-returns-pirate-fish"&gt;
seized illegal nets.&lt;/a&gt; Because unlike many governments, we're not
about to stand by while our oceans are plundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues such as over-fished and illegal Eastern Baltic cod,
destructive fishing techniques like bottom trawling and reliance on
severely depleted and often illegal tuna still cast dark shadows
over the future of the seafood sector, including several of the
letter-writing companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the situation in the Baltic Sea puts a
number of additional pressures on fish stocks: overfishing,
pollution, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment of the water caused
largely by agricultural run-off), climate change, oil spills,
bottom trawling and destruction of habitats have made a
catastrophic situation, further threatening the survival of cod and
other species.  Illegal fishing just makes a really bad situation
far, far worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pirate fishing can be stopped. Governments can outlaw flags of
convenience and refuse entry to fishing and supply vessels. It is a
matter of political will to deliver the kind of enforcement that is
needed to protect the marine environment and the communities that
depend upon it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us who buy fish, whether we're seafood conglomerates or
buying an evening's meal, need to ask if the fish we're buying is
illegal.  And governments like Norway need to make sure we can get
a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=IUUgetinvolvedlink"&gt;Online activism in the form of pressure on Seafood companies helped move this issue forward.

<item><language>en</language><title>An urgent message from PNG forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/an-urgent-message-070507/</url><text>
	Delegates of the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) received a surprise message today. Greenpeace activists unfurled a huge banner reading "ITTO Stop Forest Destruction" outside their hotel.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/5/greenpeace-activists-abseiled.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists send a big message to delegates of the 42nd International Tropical Timber Organization meeting.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists abseiled off the Crowne Plaza hotel in downtown Port
Moresby, hanging a banner for today's meeting of the 42nd
International Tropical Timber Organization committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As security guards tried to cut the banner down, a crowd
gathered outside the hotel, shouting, "Leave it up there!" No
activists were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/photo-stories/deforestation/activists-send-a-message-for-p" target="_blank"&gt;Viewtoday's action slideshow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is highlighting tropical forest destruction as
governments, including Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and New
Zealand, meet in Papua New Guinea's capital for the ITTO
conference. Most of PNG's timber is illegally logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ITTO faults PNG forest management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ITTO diagnostic report has found the PNG Forest Authority
focuses "almost exclusively on exploitation of the forest resource
for the primary financial benefit of the national government".
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also says, "Forest management is reduced to
monitoring logging operations at the expense of overall Sustainable
Forest Management."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the ITTO going to do about PNG's disastrous forestry
management? Based on their report findings, they must take
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Greenpeace Australia Pacific CEO, Steve Shallhorn,
"Greenpeace has taken action today to challenge the ITTO to protect
rather than trade away the planet's last tropical forests. They
must do more to ensure countries like PNG do something about
illegal and destructive logging."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Climate change and our disappearing forests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Panel on Climate Change says protecting large
expanses of rainforest is one of the most cost effective ways to
halt climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government wants to spend $200 million to combat
Indonesian illegal logging. However, some of the region's most
important tropical forests will disappear unless PNG's illegal
logging is addressed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Steve Shallhorn, "The best thing the Australian government
can do to protect our region's tropical forests, and keep forests
intact to combat climate change, is to urgently pass legislation
that ensures that illegal and destructive timber does not enter the

	Greenpeace activists have started construction on a  replica of Noah's Ark, 2,500 meters (8,200 feet) above sea level.  Many people believe that Mount Ararat is the place where Noah's Ark landed after the floods. The replica ark is designed to be a symbol of hope and dramatic plea to world leaders to take far-reaching and urgent action to avoid catastrophic global warming.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A caravan of 40 horses hauled twelve cubic meters of prefabricated wooden sections to an elevation of 2,500 meters, where work has now begun on constructing supports as well as the keel and ribs of the boat.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) confirmed the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate
change caused by human activity and detailed the possible
consequences if we fail to act immediately. While the picture they
paint is a dire one, there are concrete steps we can take now to
avoid the more nightmarish scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building the message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10m x 4m x 4m (32ft x 13ft x 13ft) wooden ship, being
constructed by Greenpeacevolunteers, will send a strong message to
leaders of all nations that we must act now to tackle global
warming and the impendingclimate change crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A caravan of 40 horses have hauled the prefabricated wooden
sections up Mount Ararat, where work has now begunon constructing
supports as well as the keel and ribs of the boat. Over the next 2
weeks, a team of 20 German and Turkish carpenters willcomplete the
construction of the boat, which will be turned over to thepublic in
an official ceremony on  May 31, 2007. A day before the ceremony,
activists will climb the 5,137 metersummit of Mount Ararat and call
on the leaders of all nations to makeclimate protection a
reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building towards a solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace recently launched the &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;, a
blueprintfor avoiding dangerous climate change and keeping global
warming tounder two degrees. &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;The Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;
sets out a detailed plan up to2050 showing how to make reductions
in greenhouse gases - which IPCCprescribes can be achieved using
current renewable energy technologyand energy efficiency measures -
without harming economic growth andtaking into account population
increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the upcoming G8 summit, many announcements will be madeon
climate protection, but they must be followed by real action,"said
Andree Böhling, a Greenpeace energy campaigner, "Otherwise, theG8
summit will pay only lip service to climate change and ahistoric
opportunity will be lost."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change could mean a future with huge coastal flooding,
drought,extreme destructive weather events and massive increases in
disease anddisplacement of hundreds of million of people. That's
why millions of people around the world are already mobilizing. 
They'relobbying politicians, changing what they buy and making
smart energychoices.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/brightidea?MM_URL=ararat-ark-start"&gt;Sign up to be part of this energy [r]evolution.

	We are cheering! Steve Jobs has decided to bring us closer to the greener apple that Mac users all over the world have been asking for.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Apple's site boasts "A Greener Apple" banner to announce a change in policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we saw something we've all been waiting for: the words "A Greener Apple" on the front page of Apple's site, with a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/"&gt;message from Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; saying "Today we're changing our policy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not everything we asked for. Apple has declared a phase out of the worst chemicals in its product range, Brominated Fire Retardants (BFRs) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) by 2008. That beats Dell and other computer manufactures' pledge to phase them out by 2009. Way to go Steve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while customers in the US will be able to return their Apple products for recycling knowing that their gear won't end up in the e-waste mountains of Asia and India, Apple isn't making that promise to anyone but customers in the USA.  Elsewhere in the world, an Apple product today can still be tomorrow's e-waste. Other manufacturers offer worldwide takeback and recycling. Apple should too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple hasn't gotten an actual green product to market, but no other electronics manufacture has either. That's a race worthy of the wizards of Cupertino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen the enthusiasm with which Apple fans have greeted our campaign to make Apple a green leader. They've made clear what they want -- an Apple which isn't just skin-deep green, but green to the core. One that creates products free from the most hazardous chemicals, that they can buy and return with a clear conscience, secure in the knowledge that Apple will re-use or recycle them responsibly, and that won't end up in scrapyards or add to the mountains of e-waste that the electronics industry has created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple must begin to address these growing problems to ensure that the workers and children of Asia and many developing nations no longer face the unnecessary environmental and health dangers posed by the high-techindustry's waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working with the new, greener Apple in future - toward the greening of the entire electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to all the Apple fans who have contributed their thoughts and blogs and creativity to this campaign, reach over your shoulder and pat yourself on the back. Put a happy tune on your ipod and do a happy dance. You've proven you can make a real difference. You convinced one of the world's most cutting edge companies to cut the toxic ingredients out of the products they sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's take it to the next level!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Apple green to the core!&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate fishing ships head for the scrap heap</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirate-fishing-vessels-head-fo/</url><text>
	Five blacklisted fishing trawlers that we have repeatedly exposed for illegal fishing in the North Atlantic are now heading for the scrap heap. For years, ineffective fisheries legislation allowed the operators of these vessels to plunder the high seas illegally without facing prosecution and continue to make huge profits out of a declining fishery. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/illegal-fishing-vessel-carmen.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Illegal fishing vessel "Carmen" blockaded in Polish port by Greenpeace activists.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The trail of the "trawler girls"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace documented the activities of these five fishing
trawlers (nicknamed the "trawler girls" by Greenpeace campaigners
due to the ships names all being women's names) since September
2005 while they illegally caught redfish in the Irminger Sea (an
area of the North Atlantic between Iceland and Greenland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships over-wintered in European ports and then returned to
their old fishing grounds. This happened despite the fact that all
five vessels were blacklisted by the European Union, Iceland as
well as the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (&lt;a href="http://www.neafc.org/"&gt;NEAFC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25441/rostock.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="padding: 3px; width: 424px; font-size: 0.8em; background-color: rgb(226, 235, 216);"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2005 and again in March 2006, Greenpeace activists
prevented four of these vessels from leaving Rostock harbor in
Germany and called on the German government to prevent them leaving
port. Prior to their arrival in Germany these trawlers were called
the Oyra, Ostroe, Okhotino, Olchan and Ostrovets. While they were
in Rostock harbour the owners registered the ships under a new flag
(Georgia) and changed their names to Eva, Juanita, Rosita, Isabella
and Carmen, a make-over commonly practiced by pirate fishing
vessels in order to disguise their identity and avoid inspections.
Following the Greenpeace action in Rostock harbour the German
authorities asserted that they would not re-supply the vessels but
despite breaking EU regulations, the ships managed to secure enough
fuel and supplies and were able to leave port at the end month. &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/the-expedition/news/halting-pirates"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25441/greenpeace-kontra-carmen.jpg" height="307" width="430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="padding: 3px; width: 424px; font-size: 0.8em; background-color: rgb(226, 235, 216);"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen, the fifth vessel in the blacklisted fleet had already
fled to Poland under the cover of darkness before we took action in
Germany.  But we found her in the port of Swinoujscie, wrapped her
in chains and hung a banner that read "Stop Pirate Fishing". The
Polish government ignored their obligation to prevent Carmen from
re-supplying despite their promises to do so. The vessel was
serviced, including a spell in dry dock and left port with a Polish
pilot on the 31st of March 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25441/activists-paint-the-blackliste.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="padding: 3px; width: 424px; font-size: 0.8em; background-color: rgb(226, 235, 216);"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again in March 2006 the same ships showed up in Lithuania along
with several other pirate fishing vessels. Their hulls were
promptly painted again and Greenpeace demanded that Lithuania
refuse blacklisted pirate vessels. &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/the-expedition/news/rostock-pirates-lithuania"&gt;
Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union member states like Germany, Poland and Lithuania
violated EU law by giving these pirate ships shelter, fuel, service
and assistance. The port of Klaipeda in Lithuania, where these
ships showed up, is notorious for poor reporting and registration
systems, which enables pirate fishing ships and
'flag-of-convenience' ships to unload illegally caught fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The last season of plunder in the Atlantic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having their crimes so widely exposed, the "trawler
girls" returned to the North Atlantic last year in April and spent
another five months fishing illegally. Iceland reported the
trawlers but the ships were still able to trawl in the Irminger
Sea,  where vulnerable cold-water coral (Lophelia) reefs
abound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were targeting fish species such as red fish, a species
which is showing signs of over-exploitation. Greenpeace visited the
region where the ships were fishing on an over-flight with the
Icelandic Coast Guard. We documented the 'trawler girls' fishing
side by side with some 50 other legal and illegal ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since November 2006 the ships were tied up in Kaliningrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/balticsea2006/2006/10/return_of_the_trawler_girls.html"&gt;
Arctic Sunrise informed the Russian authorities about their illegal
nature&lt;/a&gt; and the obligation of Russian authorities to stop them.
In the last  few weeks the ships have completed their final voyage
-- to the Lepaya scrap yard in Latvia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these ships being scrapped, nine others pirate
fishing ships are now being held by authorities in NEAFC ports.
Following this good news, NEAFC has just launched new blacklisting
and control procedures. We'll monitor progress carefully, since
NEAFC member states have failed to control fishing effectively over
the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too many boats, too little fish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is a global
problem that needs global solutions. It is primarily caused by the
huge over-capacity of the world's fishing fleets, the lack of
effective laws and the inability of many countries to police their
waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many states around the world are addressing the issue on a
national and regional level, they have not been able to deal with
the problem of a highly mobile pirate fishing fleet ignoring the
law all over the world. Local and regional solutions are simply not
sufficient if the international community is to deal effectively
with pirate fishing and the theft of marine life from honest
fishermen and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=RostockGirlsSignup"&gt;Online activists were a part of this victory.

<item><language>en</language><title>Chernobyl anniversary: French nuclear plant construction site shut down</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/chernobyl-anniversary-protest/</url><text>
	On this day 21 years ago a nuclear reactor near the Ukraine city of Chernobyl suffered a steam explosion and a nuclear meltdown.  Winds spread the radioactive fallout over thousands of square kilometres. Now, risky new nuclear reactors are under construction in Europe, but not on this day.  Not if we can help it.  Activists are occupying cranes and using trucks to block the entrance at the construction site of a dangerous new type of reactor in France.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/on-the-anniversary-of-the-cher.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/on-the-anniversary-of-the-cher.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            On the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, 30 Greenpeace activists from six European nations halt construction at the site of the Électricité de France’s (EDF) proposed new European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR).
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposed construction of such new reactors, which are
likely to be the most dangerous in the world, is an insult to the
memory of those who died in the immediate aftermath of Chernobyl,
and the hundreds of thousands of people whose lives continue to be
blighted by the disaster," said Frederic Marillier of Greenpeace
France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're occupying the construction site to highlight the risk to
all of Europe," said Marillier, "and we call upon the two
candidates for France's presidential election to cancel the EPR
project at Flamanville."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Not safe, not sensible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Flamanville reactor under construction in France and
the Olkiluto reactor being built in Finland are European
Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR) types. A recent independent study,
produced by John Large Associates for Greenpeace, shows that the
new generation of EPR reactors have an inherently higher risk of
serious radioactive contamination in the event of any accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/on-the-anniversary-of-the-cher-2.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.greenpeace.org/international/photosvideos/photos/on-the-anniversary-of-the-cher-2.jpg', 'item_1047779', 'height=482,width=465'); return false;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25449/on-the-anniversary-of-the-cher.jpg" alt="On the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, 30 Greenpeace activists from six European nations halt construction at the site of the Électricité de France's (EDF) proposed new European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR)." align="left" height="93" hspace="4" width="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The study,
found that for the Flamanville reactor the number of people
affected and requiring evacuation following the 'most likely' of
nuclear incidents would be about 660,000.  In a worst-case
scenario, the number of people requiring evacuation would increase
to more than 3 million. 135,000 people were evacuated following the
Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/secret-document-reveals-new-br/"&gt;
nuclear industry document&lt;/a&gt; leaked last year also raised concerns
that EPR plants are vulnerable to terrorist attack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Chernobyl's legacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only a part of history, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/chernobyl-deaths-180406/"&gt;
Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt; continues to be a nightmare for many.  There is
controversy surrounding how many have died, and how many will die,
from its nuclear fallout.  Attempts have even been made to &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/whitewashing-chernobyl-s-impac/"&gt;
whitewash&lt;/a&gt; over the true cost in lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/chernobylhealthreport/"&gt;
report&lt;/a&gt; we released last year used new data, based on Belarus
national cancer statistics, to predict approximately 270,000
cancers and 93,000 fatal cancer cases due to the disaster. The
report also concluded that on the basis of demographic data, during
the last 15 years, 60,000 people have additionally died in Russia
because of the Chernobyl accident, and estimates of the total death
toll for the Ukraine and Belarus could reach another 140,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But statistics never tell the full human story. For that, we
need to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/nuclear/nomorechernobyls/"&gt;
remember the victims&lt;/a&gt; as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

	Huge crop circles in maize fields in Mexico, Spain and Philippines have appeared as we launch a global campaign to protect the home of maize from genetic contamination.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists create a 60 metre "NO" crop circle in a maize field in Mexico demanding the Mexico Government reject the cultivation of genetically engineered maize in the country.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico is the birthplace of maize, also known as corn, and
around 200 different varieties grow in the country. Maize is one of
the biggest food crops in the world and feeds hundreds of millions
of people every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If genetically engineered (GE) maize is allowed to be released
into the environment in Mexico, it could contaminate the natural
genetic diversity of maize with unknown consequences. There has
already been GE contamination of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/the-end-of-organic-crops/"&gt;
organic maize in Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now increasing pressure on the Mexican Government from
GE companies to allow for the growing of GE maize in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Greenpeace campaign is demanding that:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governments around the world place a ban on the release of any
GE crop or seed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governments withdraw existing authorizations for both
commercial and experimental growing of GE crops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genetic contamination of crops must be cleaned up, with costs
borne by biotech companies such as Monsanto, according to the
"polluter pays" principle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>10,000 energy wasting lightbulbs crushed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/10-000-lightbulbs/</url><text>
	Energy wasting incandescent lightbulbs are so dangerously inefficient it's better for the climate (and your wallet) to smash even brand new ones rather than use them.  So we got a road roller and crushed 10,000 energy wasting lightbulbs at the Brandenburg Gate, while EU and G8 ministers were meeting in Berlin today.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/as-g8-and-eu-ministers-gather.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/as-g8-and-eu-ministers-gather.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            As G8 and EU ministers gather in Berlin to discuss energy efficiency measures, Greenpeace uses a mechanised road roller to crush ten thousand energy-wasting light bulbs at the Brandenburg Gate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've used this occasion to launch our campaign for tough
European efficiency standards for energy using products, and an
immediate ban on incandescent lightbulbs.  If EU governments are
serious about meeting their CO2 reduction commitments, they should
at least be able to act quickly on something as simple as
lightbulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Some lightbulbs are more cool than others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's debatable whether you can call compact fluorescent
lightbulbs (CFLs) "hip", but they're definitely more cool -
literally.  Incandescent bulbs waste over 90 percent of the energy
they use as heat.  CFLs use five times less energy - meaning less
global warming pollution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newer quality CFLs also produce mellow pleasing light, and come
on right away without flickering.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the International Energy Agency, electrical
lighting uses 19 percent of all electricity produced - more than
all energy produced by nuclear power.  Governments and even
lightbulb manufactures are already calling for an end to energy
wasting lightbulbs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;European Union situation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rough calculation:  Every (11 Watt) CFL saves 20kg CO2 per
year on average. So for Europe... 20kg CO2 x 1.6 billion bulbs sold
= 32 million tons CO2 potential savings per year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By just switching from old to new lighting technology in the EU
we could close down 25 medium sized power plants (2TWh/year), and
possibly save Europe 3-5 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the EU level there's a process called the Ecodesign
directive, which could eventually result in effectively banning
energy wasting lightbulbs, but so far it's just talk.  Rather than
waiting, EU ministers should instigate immediate national bans on
lightbulbs, and push for enforcement of an Europe-wide mandatory
efficiency standard on domestic lighting by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What you can do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and easiest thing is to replace your energy wasting
incandescent lightbulbs with modern CFLs.  It's better to throw out
even brand new energy wasting incandescent bulbs then use them. 
Switching to CFLs will reduce your personal energy use, prevent
pollution and save you some money - while sending a message to
politicians and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up for bright ideas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/brightidea"&gt;Sign up for our Bright Ideas email list.

	After three days of blockading the toxic tanker Probo Koala, we were pleased to hear that the Government of Estonia is investigating the ship, which is responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people in the Ivory Coast -- and the illnesses of thousands more, due to irresponsible dumping of toxic waste.

            The "toxic tanker" Probo Koala, blockaded for three days by the Arctic Sunrise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Helen Perivier explains, "The Probo Koala
is aninternational toxic crime scene and needs to be fully
investigated toestablish the full chain of culpability which led to
the tragic deadlyevents in the Ivory Coast," she said. "Only
through such aninvestigation can the guilty be brought to justice
and the lessonslearned in order to prevent this from happening
again."  We weredelighted to hear that the Estonian Authorities are
now taking suchaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dumping the West's waste ... in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thescandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties were reported
andprotests broke out on the streets of Abidjan against the
government,which was blamed for allowing the dumping.  Despite
this, theKorean-built, Greek-managed, Panamanian-flagged and
Dutch-charteredtanker was allowed to sail freely …until we blocked
it from leavingEstonia.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Banned: GE Rice Imports</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/banned-290906/</url><text>
	Just weeks after we uncovered US rice on supermarket shelves in Europe contained illegal genetically engineered (GE) rice, the scandal keeps growing with more illegal GE rice being discovered. In the latest blow for the GE industry, the world's largest rice processing company has stopped importing US rice into Europe due to the threat of contamination. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rice is life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebro Puleva, which controls 30 percent of the European rice
market, hasstopped importing US rice due to the presence of an
illegal GE ricestrain. The rice strain causing the contamination is
called LL601 andhas not been approved for human consumption
anywhere in the world. Thecompany responsible for the contamination
is Germany's Bayer who endedfield trials of LL601 in the US five
years ago. However, the LL601 riceescaped the field trials and has
now contaminated an unknown number ofconventional rice fields
across the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/contaminated-chinese-rice090506/"&gt;
Greenpeace investigations&lt;/a&gt;recently found another illegal GE rice
contamination outbreak. Thistime it is from China and is a variety
of rice called Bt63. Like the UShowever, Bt63 rice also escaped
field trials and has now been found inprocessed rice imports into
Europe. The extent of both GEcontaminations is still unknown with
new discoveries of contaminatedrice occurring almost daily across
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move by EbroPuleva to stop importing US rice follows a
summer of scandals, withillegal GE contamination found in rice
products all over Europe as wellas in Japan. As a result of Bayer's
recklessness, the global foodindustry is facing massive costs
associated with this contamination,including testing costs, product
recalls, brand damage, import bans andcancelled imports and
contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least three multi-milliondollar class action lawsuits have
been filed by US rice farmers againstBayer CropScience already, as
farmers struggle to protect theirlivelihoods from GE contamination.
To compound Bayer's legal problems,they may soon be in the legal
sights of Ebro Puleva too. The world'slargest rice company has
indicated that they expect to bring legalactions against Bayer as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By imposing a blanket ban onrice imports from the US, Ebro
Puleva has acknowledged how real andcostly the risk of GE
contamination is," said Jeremy Tager, GEcampaigner from Greenpeace
International. "With GE now as uneconomic asit is unacceptable,
governments in countries that grow or import GEmust stop placing
farmers, consumers, the environment and industry atsuch high
risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice scandal continues to ragejust as the WTO has
finally published a ruling on a case broughtagainst the EU by the
US, Canada and Argentina over Europe imposingrestrictions on the
importing of GE food. At its heart, the dispute isabout whether
trade laws trump environmental laws - and surprise,surprise, to the
WTO it is trade law rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The WTO is clearlyunqualified to deal with complex scientific
and environmental issues,and yet, when there is a conflict between
trade and environmentalconsiderations, it is the WTO that gets to
decide which rules rule;it's like putting the fox in charge of the
chickens," said DanielMittler, Trade Policy Advisor at Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thelatest GE contamination scandal shows that once GE organisms
arereleased into the environment, the consequences for consumers,
farmersand traders are enormous. The WTO has no place determining
what peopleshould eat and illegal GE rice has no place on the
dinner tables ofconsumers anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=ge-rice-wto"&gt;Sign up for our free activist newsletter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=ge-rice-wto"&gt;Help us continue to fight against GE contamination of our food.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In the decades between the 1950s and 1970s birch trees in Finland were considered 'flora non grata' by foresters as they weren't commercially useful. They were routinely cut down and poisoned to reduce their numbers. In some areas, the Finns even resorted to spraying the birch forests with the deadly defoliant Agent Orange, of Vietnam War infamy. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now however, the birch tree is commercially useful as pulp for
the paper industry. Not surprisingly after destroying so much birch
forest for decades, the Finns don't have enough birch forest left
for the requirements of their timber industry. So now they import
birch logs from Russia, many of which are illegally logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forest-crime-finland/"&gt;
recent investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed the extent of this trade in
illegal logs across the Russian-Finnish border. The response of the
Finnish Government to the illegal logging uncovered by the
investigation has been to shrug its shoulders:  no government
action required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an unacceptable response from a Government that
considers itself a 'superpower of forests'. Having abdicated its
responsibilities to control illegal timber coming across its
borders to industry, it doesn't even get involved when presented
with evidence of industry failure", said Sini Harkki, Greenpeace
Nordic campaigner. "We've decided to award Finland with the
infamous Golden Chainsaw award, which we reserve for the worst
forest crime offenders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent World Bank report cited the cost of lost revenues to
the market and governments due to illegal activity at US$10-15
billion annually. In the face of the massive trade in illegal
timber, the European Commission is currently considering
legislative options to tackle the problem of illegally logged
timber being imported into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ban on illegal timber being imported and sold in Europe has
strong support from Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the
business community. Greenpeace, together with over &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/controlling-timber-imports-int-2/"&gt;
160 NGO's&lt;/a&gt; and over 80 businesses, including IKEA, Homebase,
Castorama France, B&amp;amp;Q, Finnforest (UK) are all calling for EU
legislation to make it illegal to import illegally sourced timber
and wood products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's response to the problem has been weak,
claiming that voluntary measures are enough. Beyond that the
European Commission has been taking the slow road to action, with a
promised report on options on further legislation to stem the flow
of illegal timber due over two years ago. It is now time for action
from the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we are calling for is European-Union-wide legislation to
ensure that illegally logged timber does not end up on the European
market whether it is from Russia, the Amazon, Indonesia or
laundered from Asia and the Pacific through China", said Sue
Connor, Greenpeace forest campaigner. "Finland must start acting as
a responsible state body and support the call for EU legislation to
ban illegal timber."&lt;/p&gt;

	Some of the best-known laptops are contaminated with some of the worst toxic chemicals. Of the five top brands we tested Hewlett-Packard and Apple laptops showed the worst contamination levels.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/toxic-laptop-testing.jpg" title=""&gt;

            Dismantling laptop prior to testing for toxic chemicals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independant Danish laboratory tested for the presence of
several toxicchemicals, including brominated flame retardants
(BFRs), polyvinylchloride plastic (PVC), and even lead, in brand
new laptops from fiveof the world's leading manufacturers (Acer,
Apple, Dell, HP, Sony). HPand Apple laptops contained the highest
levels of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been pressuring leading electronic companies to ditch
toxicchemicals in favour of safer alternatives. The laptop tests
reveal ifthe top companies are matching nice green words with real
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical lies?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results for HP revealed high levels of a number of chemicals in
itscomponents, in particular the highest levels by far of PBDEs (a
classof Brominated Fire Retardants) including something called
decaBDE. &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/productdesign/materialuse.html"&gt;
HP's website claims&lt;/a&gt; it removed decaBDE fromits products years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either HP is lying or HP needs to ask itssuppliers some tough
questions. Lead was also found in the soldering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP has been downgraded due to these results on our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Guide to GreenerElectronics&lt;/a&gt;.  The guide ranks PC and mobile
companies on their chemical andwaste policies and practices. HP was
third but has slipped to sixthposition, with 4.7 out of 10, down
from 5.7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poison Apples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has recently launched its new range of MacBooks, but what
youalso get with a new MacBook is the highest level of another type
oftoxic flame retardant, tetrabromobisphenol A. &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/materials/"&gt;Apple claims&lt;/a&gt;
it islooking for alternatives but for now it appears to be using
far more of thistoxic chemical than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Brigden, of the Greenpeace Science Unit, was alarmedby
the results: "During the sampling process it was remarkable to
notethat, whether Mac or PC, once you by-pass the sleek and cool
design ofthese computers, hazardous substances are a component
common to all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/recycling-of-electronic-waste/"&gt;
Greenpeace research&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the same toxic
chemicalsfound in these tests are polluting electronic waste
(e-waste) scrapyards in China and India. These yards are often the
final pollutedresting place of computers thrown away in other
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brigden visited these yards to take samples in 2005:
"BFRs,especially PDBEs, were widespread in the recycling yards
andsurrounding environment in China and India where electronics
componentsare being scrapped. Lead was also found in many
locations, often atvery high levels."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because none of the large electronics players have a
comprehensivetake-back policy for their old products many old
computers end up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/"&gt;
dumped inAsia&lt;/a&gt; and recycled by hand in appalling conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronics is a fast moving, innovative industry that can
respondquickly to users' wishes and new trends. It's high time it
moved quicklyto make greener, longer-lasting products to help
reverse the growingtrend in toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

	Renewable energy and energy efficiency are vital. The next two decades are crucial.  Changing our energy use is less costly than changing our climate. These are findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report "Mitigating Climate Change", released today.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            SolarGeneration youth at a Buddhist temple in the small coastal village of Khun Samutchine, the first community in Thailand to suffer the direct impacts of coastal erosion caused largely by storm surges brought about by climate change. The temple, now beside the eroded coastline, was once located several kilometers from the beach.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the IPCC issued their &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ippc-climate-warning-020207/"&gt;
strongest warning yet&lt;/a&gt; on climate change and detailed the
possible &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/new-climate-impacts-report-fro/"&gt;
consequences&lt;/a&gt; if we fail to act.  The latest IPCC report reviews
what we can do to reduce our global warming emissions, keeping
global warming from becoming catastrophic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the final piece of the jigsaw in place the picture of our
options for the future is now in sharp focus," said Stephanie
Tunmore, Greenpeace International climate and energy campaigner in
Bangkok. "It is quite clear that immediate action to cut greenhouse
gas emissions is required. The longer the delay, the higher the
temperature increase and the greater the impacts; further
procrastination could have a devastating effect on the lives of
billions of people across the world".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Nuclear problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IPCC, nuclear power accounted for 16 percent of
the electricity supply in 2005 and could have an 18 percent share
of the total electricity supply in 2030, but "...safety, weapons
proliferation and waste remain as constraints."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, other research shows we can reduce carbon emissions
much more cheaply and effectively using renewable energy and energy
efficiency measures.  Dollar for dollar, investing in energy
efficiency is seven times more cost effective at reducing CO2
emissions then investing in nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it were safe or economical, it's also clear that nuclear
power capacity cannot be built rapidly enough to be much help. The
average construction time for nuclear plant completions 1995 - 2000
was 116 months (nearly 10 years).  As a contrasting example, the
first offshore wind farm in the UK took only eight months to
build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this makes the dangers of nuclear power a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Costs of climate change vs. costs of an energy [r]evolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projected costs of climate protection measures are far
outweighed by the costs of escalating climate impacts under
business-as-usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report stabilization between 450 and 550 ppm
would cost from 0.2 percent to less than 3 percent of global gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2030, or less than 0.1 percent per
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures for the cost of business-as-usual with no action are not
given by the IPCC, but according to the UK Government's Stern
report (October 2006) it could be 5-10 percent of global GDP and
under the worst case scenario it could rise to as much as 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Sven Teske, Greenpeace International climate and
energy campaigner, "Our own global energy concept means that the
investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a
range of 300-350 billion dollars per year - almost equal to the
amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To
shift this money, and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration
could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030,
which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;But will governments and politicians listen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Bangkok meeting IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri
was asked how the organization would make governments listen to the
report findings.  In reply he pointed out, "The IPCC doesn't have
any muscle, it has grey matter. The muscle will have to come from
somewhere else."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why millions around the world are already mobilizing. 
They're lobbying politicians, changing what they buy and making
smart energy choices.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/brightidea?MM_URL=ipcc_wg3_2007_wrap"&gt;Sign up to be part of this energy [r]evolution.

            Does this belong to you? Apple e-waste in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen the electronic graveyards in China and India where
old electronic devices end up, Macs included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'veseen children waist-deep in cables, keyboards and circuit
boardspicking through a soup of hazardous chemicals, including lead

We'veseen them breathing in dioxins as the PVC cables and casings
burnaround them, watched them stop drinking from local wells
polluted withheavy metals. Lives are being cut short for thousands
of children inthe developing world exposed to dangerous
chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not what Apple is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appleknows more about simple, "clean" design than any other
computermanufacturer on the planet. You'd expect Apple to be the
world leaderin clean environmental practice. But they're not.  Far
from it.Apple products contain hazardous substances which other
manufacturershave commited to stop using.  While Apple has
introduced a limitedtake-back policy in the US, other companies
have worldwide take-backand recycling programmes that are far
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/9/ilovemymac.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is going to make Apple change its ways?  You are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Think different: Green my Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wedecided to Think Different on this campaign.  We're not
hangingbanners off the Apple HQ or using our ships to blockade
their supplychain or bungy-jumping into the next MacWorld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we knowa force that Apple listens to, and which can make
Apple adopt cleanproduction policies and improve its recycling
programmes. It's Apple'scustomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple listens to the people who buy their product: it's one of
the things we all love about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andit's why we want you to run this campaign.  We want you to
createthe campaign T-shirt, pen the speech in which Steve Jobs
announces theGreening of Apple, shoot the Apple Ad that sets
Cupertino talking aboutclean production and take-back schemes. The
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple" target="_blank"&gt;Green my
Apple website&lt;/a&gt;has all the information and the raw materials you
need to get youstarted.  If you're creative, create. If you're
networked,network. There's plenty to do, and many hands make light
work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Come on, Steve. Be a hero for the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good products and good design ought to be good for theplanet.
That's an Apple kind of attitude, isn't it? So have a word

Appleproducts. Let him know you want Apple to provide a free
take-backprogram to reuse and recycle its products wherever they
are sold -- andnot just in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

	Actress Sigourney Weaver, star of Alien and Ghostbusters, has joined us at the UN in New York calling for a moratorium on high- seas bottom trawling.  Adding more weight to Team Ocean Defenders, the US government has also been supportive.  George W. Bush himself issued a  statement calling for an “end [to] destructive fishing practices,  such as unregulated bottom trawling”.  This week’s UN meeting may  be our last chance for real action to save the “aliens of the deep”.

            Actress and activist Sigourney Weaver speaks at the UN press briefing held to promote a resolution on high-seas bottom trawling.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Weaver said, "The oceans that millions of people around the
world depend on for sustenance and livelihood are being plundered
while the world sits by and watches. Some of the oldest ecosystems
on Earth are being destroyed.  Most people think somebody somewhere
is looking out for the deep oceans, but they aren't. These deep sea
trawlers are operating beyond the reach of the law. It's up to all
of us to change that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigourney Weaver joined us at a press briefing in New York
organised by the  Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, of which we are
members.  We were also joined by the UN Ambassadors from Australia,
New Zealand and Palau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25347/this-creature-is-transparent-s.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Aliens (of the Deep)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might not be quite as scary as the Aliens in one of
Sigourney's movies, but the deep sea creatures threatened by
bottom  trawling are unique and often previously unknown to
science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen Sack, our political advisor, said, "The UN has the power
to protect the irreplaceable ecosystems of the deep sea bed from
the  relentless march of bottom trawlers. If it fails to act, it
would  be closing its eyes and allowing these unknown worlds to be 
destroyed before we fully understand all the life they contain-like
blowing up Mars before we get there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Galaxy Quest&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/world-ocean-day-2006"&gt;
Team Ocean Defenders&lt;/a&gt; save these unknown worlds?  Australia,
Brazil, the  UK, South Africa, Chile,  the  Netherlands, Germany
and many Pacific Island nations are among  those that have called
for a halt to unregulated high seas bottom  trawling.  Canada,
Spain, Russia and Iceland lead the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the US became deep-sea defenders.  President Bush &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/white-house-memo/"&gt;
issued a  statement&lt;/a&gt;calling for rules based on sound  science
to  "end destructive fishingpractices such such as  unregulated
bottom trawling, explosives andchemicals that destroy  the
long-term productivity of ecosystems suchas seamounts, corals,  and
sponge fields". The US will be chairing thenegotiations which
commence at the UN today -  October 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Year of Living Dangerously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;
released a report&lt;/a&gt; calling for the establishment of 40 percent
of the world's oceans as &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
marine reserves&lt;/a&gt;.  Since then the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/un-bottom-trawling/"&gt;
UN itself recognised the need for a halt to unregulated high seas
bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, as the  UN talks, the bottom
trawling continues.  We hopethat this week  the UN will decide to
implement a moratorium on highseas bottom  trawling and pave a way
for a worldwide network of fullyprotected marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Deadly cargo dumped in the Ivory Coast</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ivory-coast-toxic-dumping/</url><text>
	Toxic waste from Europe openly dumped on the streets of an African capital city. Six people dead and thousands requiring medical treatment. The Ivory Coast cabinet resigns but still no one owns up to the dumping. How could this be allowed to happen?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties where
reported andprotests broke out on the streets against the
government, which wasblamed for allowing the dumping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the wastes are deadly. Four of the six
dead arechildren and 23 people have required hospital treatment so
far. Thefact that the toxic waste was dumped openly on the streets
of a city isshocking enough. The fact that the waste was delivered
by a shipchartered by Trafigura LTD (controlled by Dutch firm
Trafigura BeheerBV), who claimed they thought the waste would be
'properly treated' ina poor African nation raises serious questions
about why they sent itto Africa. The fact that international law
may have been broken makesit a serious scandal that such deadly
incidents still occur today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Back from the past?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We campaigned long and hard for an international ban on the
dumping oftoxic waste by rich countries in poor countries, which
resulted in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt;
Basel Ban in 1998&lt;/a&gt;.  So we want to know how the dumping
occurred, what was dumpedand who is responsible. A &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxic-waste-in-abidjan-green/"&gt;
full version of what we know to date&lt;/a&gt; isavailable but here is a
short summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 19 August, a ship called the Probo Koala unloaded a toxic
wasteshipment in Abidjan, the main economic capital of the Ivory
Coast.However it was not until the first week of September that the
incident came tolight. The Ivorian Ministry of Health announced an
extraordinarymeeting that led to the dismissal of its government on
6 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As international and/or local environmental laws may have been
broken,we are calling for a transparent and thorough investigation
by therespective international and local authorities. The facts
behind thisdeadly tragedy in the Ivory Coast remain obscured by the
vesselcharterer, Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to investigate the chain of events, but the lack of
transparency in the shippingindustry as a whole, and specifically
from Trafigura and various portauthorities, are hiding the facts
from the public.Official investigations on the national and
international levels areurgently called for to establish
liabilities, to indicate where nationsare failing to uphold their
international commitments and to make surethis deadly type of
export never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mystery movements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 2 the Probo Koala attempted to unload waste in
Amsterdam.Noting the strong-smelling nature of the waste and
probable toxic nature, harbour authoritiestold the ship that the
waste would be more expensive to dispose of. The ship refused to
pay extra treatment costs and leftAmsterdam. Where the ship went
between the 2 July and 19 August, andwhat it did with its toxic
cargo, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Abidjan the ship unloaded waste supposedly to be treated
by anIvorian waste handling firm. In fact the waste, which appears
toconsist of volatile hydrocarbons, was dumped at 11 sites in the
city.Symptoms reported by those who come in contact with the waste
includerespiratory problems, nausea, dizziness, vomiting (including
throwingup blood), burns and irritation from the toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will anyone take responsibility?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is established where the waste originated in Europe,
thatcountry could be liable to take back the waste. If the toxic
waste wasconsidered regulated under the Basel Convention and bound
for export,the Dutch Authorities could have prevented the ship
leaving with toxicwaste onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is obvious that the crisis could not have happened
without thelocal public and private complicity, the company
Trafigura clearlyshould be the centre of an investigation into any
attempt to takeadvantage of legal loopholes and grey areas to
assess if itdeliberately broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Globe warms: rainforests burn</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/going-up-in-smoke-120906/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Forest fires rage across Indonesia and Brazil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In what is becoming an annual event, increasingly frequent and more intense fires are sweeping through the tropical rainforests of Indonesia and Brazil. The burning of the rainforests not only threaten biodiversity in the affected areas but, by contributing towards climate change, they also put the entire planet at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/forestfires2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/forestfires2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace team has investigated and documented the forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia, which have now become an annual phenomenon, thanks to the effects of unsustainable logging, and are the cause of a thick smog-like haze over the entire region which threatens the health of millions of people and adds to the problem of climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tropical latitudes, months pass without any rain and in the
dryseason forests become susceptible to fire. These can occur
naturallyand would normally not pose a serious problem, but
clearing land as aresult of logging or to make way for plantations
is exacerbating theproblem and every year the fires spread faster
and further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeaceteams in both Indonesia and Brazil have recorded the
scale of theinfernos and are clear about the reasons why they are
happening. Muchof the forests in the Indonesian province of Riau in
Sumatra arepeatland forests, so normally protected from fire by
their boggy environment,but industrial activity has changed all
that. The forests are beingcleared for plantations of oil palms and
acacia pulpwood for paper,creating the perfect conditions for fires
at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oncethese peat swamps are exposed due to logging," Greenpeace
forestcampaigner Hapsoro explained, "they dry out like a wet sponge
exposedto sunlight and become extremely flammable. Once it starts
burning,it's very difficult to stop without heavy rain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects ofthe Indonesian fire also spread across the region.
Smoke drifts acrossSouth East Asia, clogging the air above the
Malaysian peninsular andincurring the wrath of neighbouring
governments, and Hapsoro urged theIndonesian authorities to take
urgent measures. "The Indonesiangovernment must seriously
reconsider allowing any type of land clearingto be done in these
areas to minimise the possibility of large anduncontrolled forest
fires," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Brazilian Amazon,fires have been witnessed in several
protected areas and the Greenpeaceteam sent to investigate also saw
rampant deforestation and illegallogging. In the Jamanzim National
Forest, using natural resourcesresponsibly is permitted, but
intense logging activity has beenobserved within protected
areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both regions boast some of themost diverse varieties of plant
and animal life anywhere in the worldbut fragile habitats, already
under pressure from human activities, arebeing pushed even harder
by the increasing number and scale of thefires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rest of the world suffers too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainforestsplay a vital role in regulating the global climate
and the more treesthat are felled, the more unpredictable the
climate will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropicaldeforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global
carbon dioxideemissions, a staggering amount that explains why 75
percent of Brazil'sown carbon dioxide contribution comes from
forest conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butwith drought plaguing many areas - such as last year's
catastrophicevent in the Amazon - the forests dry out and become
even moresusceptible to fire. This in turn releases more carbon
dioxide and smoginto the atmosphere, accelerating climate change
and the cycle ofdestruction continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem for Brazil andIndonesia but for the
whole planet. Concrete efforts must be made at alocal level to
protect rainforests from illegal logging and conversionto
plantations, but there must also be international support to
backthis up. Sustainable management of the forests allows local
communitiesto support themselves and make a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=forest-fires"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=forest-fires"&gt;Make a donation and help save the forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Facing down stick-wielding personnel, water-canon-spraying marine police,and gun-wielding navy seals, five Greenpeace activists in Thailand have delayed a shipment of Australian coal from being unloaded at a controversial coal plant in Maptaphut, Thailand.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in Thailand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five activists chained themselves to the pier bumper and
hung banners that read 'Coal = climate change, Clean Energy Now'.
They remained for two hours before being detained by police with
the help of Navy seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 170,00 tonne carrier, MV Star Europe, carrying a large
shipment of coal from Newcastle, NSW (the world's largest coal
exporting port) has been anchored a few nautical miles away,
waiting for the area to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coal plant, BLCP,  is jointly owned by Banpu and Hong Kong
based China Light and scheduled to open in October. BLCP is a
classic example of dirty international financing by the likes of
Asian Development Bank and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The BLCP coal plant will exacerbate the impacts of climate
change, which is already starting to exact a heavy toll on the
people and economies of Thailand and Southeast Asia. It does not
help that Australia is fuelling climate change in the region with
its coal exports," said Tara Buakamsri of Greenpeace Southeast
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thailand must stop any further use of coal and put a policy in
place for the massive increase of renewable energy and energy
efficiency projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1,434 MW BLCP coal plant will release nearly 12 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, and once in operation this
plant alone will cause Thailand's carbon emissions to rise by
almost 6 percent a year, according to Greenpeace projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, emitting 29 percent more
carbon per unit of energy than oil and 80 percent more than gas,
and contributing significantly to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal and coal-fired power stations have been strongly opposed
by communities in the region. However, the Australian government
refuses to take action on global warming while ignoring climate
impacts on its own citizens and other countries in Asia. The whole
region will be further threatened by the increase of investments in
coal power plants across Asia many of which will rely on the supply
of Australian coal." said Catherine Fitzpatrick, Greenpeace
Australia Pacific energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists and youth climate action group, the Solar Generation, stage a mobile exhibition inside the Asian Development Bank's Annual Meeting. Greenpeace is calling on the Bank to honour the Kyoto Protocol, stop investing in coal and start investing in renewable energy to reduce CO2 emissions in Asia, the continent that will suffer most from the effects of climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADB is supposed to help not harm.  Its mission is to fight
poverty.  It can (and does) wield great influence over energy
technology choices - its funding acts as a catalyst, attracting
additional private funding and its policies carry serious weight
with member countries.  They are ideally placed to fund an energy
revolution, but so far ADB has largely favoured coal and other
dirty technologies, while only putting a token effort into the
renewable energy projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 40th annual meeting of the ADB was held in Kyoto, Japan --
birthplace of the Kyoto Protocol, the only legally binding
international treaty that obligates a reduction of greenhouse gases
globally. This year marks the tenth year since the Protocol was
passed, and it wasn't a wild notion to think the ADB's conference
would attempt to measure up to the legacy of Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Kyoto with very specific demands for the ADB to
phase out coal, dramatically scale up its renewable energy and
energy efficiency initiatives and guarantee that the US$1 billion
annual clean energy pipeline that it put together would remain free
of coal. And certainly we had fun getting our message across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kimonos and 'love shirts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our request for space to hold an exhibition of climate
impacts was turned down, we decided to take the exhibition on the
road using the widest T-shirts ever designed, which gave ADB
officials a serious dilemma since it wasn't exactly a banner
protest and neither was it an exhibit. We dubbed the wide berth
T-shirts, 'love shirts' for their partnership-creating
qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/solargen/"&gt;Solar
Generation&lt;/a&gt; students also surprised the meeting when, at a big
dinner banquet hosted by the ADB president, they turned up as six
mysterious kimono girls in complete costume and with complete
makeup. They only revealed their identity when they stopped in
front of ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda and elegantly opened their
Japanese fans, which together read "Clean Energy Now! ADB Quit
Coal!" They stayed for the whole evening, charming and then
disarming the Bank's Governors who fell over themselves for the
photo op. The girls had taken 5 hours to get ready and couldn't
drink during the performance because of the difficulty of getting
out of the costumes. The response they received proved that it was
well worth it though as they engaged the Bank's highest officials
in debates about climate change and the clean energy solutions that
the Bank could enable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/solargen/"&gt;Solar
Generation&lt;/a&gt; students had also created beautiful bookmarks using
Japan's national flower, the cherry blossom, to symbolise the
impacts of climate change as the blossom was a lot earlier this
year due to the warmer winter. The bookmarks carried Solar
Generation's demands to the ADB and the students handed them out to
Bank delegates with helpful advice that they could read the
messaging when the meeting got boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's amazing to see the difference we can make inside such an
institution as the ADB. Our decision to combine a series of highly
visual direct communication activities with the expert policy
dialogue really had an impact on the decision makers at the
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Several steps backwards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the ADB had actually put together a series of
clean energy initiatives that held a lot of promise in response to
the pressure we had sustained. We made sure the ADB knew that we
welcomed the new measures and it seemed like our creative
enforcement of our demands in the opening days of the meeting were
working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the penultimate day of the ADB's meeting, however, things
began to fall apart. The Bank's Board Chair Koji Omi, also Japan's
Finance Minister, was pushing nuclear energy as a solution to
climate change as well as disgracefully dissing the Kyoto Protocol
- the only show in town when it comes to giving us a sustainable
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How unfortunate. The clean energy initiatives and funding
commitments the ADB unveiled in this meeting are clear steps
forward. But continued support for coal and tolerance for nuclear,
however, has taken the ADB five steps backward. The only pathway to
Asia's sustainable future is signposted 'renewable energy and
energy efficiency' and we call on the ADB to lead Asia down that
road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/campaigns/climate-change/asian-development-bank"&gt;Tell the ADB to stop funding climate change and start funding the solution, renewable energy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=ADB-AGM"&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions.

	The genetic engineering industry sank to a new low when it was revealed recently that US company Bayer's field trials of genetically engineered (GE) rice had contaminated rice exports. Japan moved fast and banned the US rice from coming into its ports. The EU quickly followed and placed import restrictions and testing regimes in place.  Now, Greenpeace research has uncovered a new example of contamination of the world's most important staple food. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Products found to contain illegal and untested genetically engineered rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently uncovered, and independently verified, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/IllegalChinaGErice"&gt;
that illegal GE rice from China has contaminated food products&lt;/a&gt;
in France, Germany and the UK. We've notified authorities that the
illegal GE rice poses serious health risks and we're calling upon
European governments to take immediate action to protect
consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace offices and Friends of the Earth in the UK tested
samples of rice products such as vermicelli, rice sticks and other
processed foods. Five positive samples were found containing an
illegal GE organism not approved anywhere in the world. However
this may only be the tip of the iceberg. Rice products are included
in everything from baby food to yoghurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level
responses", said Jeremy Tager, GE rice campaigner, Greenpeace
International. "Consumers should not be left swallowing
experimental GE rice that is risky to their health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice, genetically engineered to be resistant to
insects, contains a protein or fused protein (Cry1Ac) that has
reportedly induced allergic-like reactions in mice. Three
independent scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ScientistStatementHealthConcernsGErice" target="_blank"&gt;issued a statement backing the health concerns we
raised&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International is calling for immediate worldwide
recall, measures to ensure no further contaminated rice enters the
EU and the urgent implementation of a preventative screening system
for countries with high contamination risks. Demanding GE-free
certification for food from countries that grow and produce GE
crops is reasonable, cost effective, and necessary to protect
Europe's consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bayer's illegal GE rice in the US, this recent rice
contamination in China began with field trials; the rice is not
currently approved for commercial growing because of mounting
concerns over its safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innocent consumers again become the victims," says Tager. 
"Once illegal GE crops are in the food chain, removing them takes
enormous effort and cost. It is easier to prevent contamination in
the first place," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that
is grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens
biodiversity and poses unacceptable risks to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GE_rice_signup"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GE_rice_donate"&gt;In order to maintain our independence, we don't accept funding from governments or corporations.

	All drinks at the Olympics are on us, kind of. Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola today announced a commitment to use coolers and vending machines free of HFC gases in all official venues of the 2008 Olympic Games, demonstrating climate-friendly technology developed by Greenpeace. Getting to here has been an amazing journey over 20 years involving the most unlikely characters and situations -- even George W. Bush makes a last-minute appearance.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;CFCs to HFCs: frying pan to fire&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced
thebanning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration
industryswitched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). HFC's don't destroy
the ozonelike CFC's can. But they do cause global warming. Indeed,
some HFCgases are up to 11,000 times more harmful to the climate
than carbondioxide (CO2), your garden variety greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Solution: Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch from CFC's to HFC's
andshow how it should bedone, Greenpeace launched the concept of
Greenfreeze in 1992. We mettwoscientists who pointed out how to
avoid HFC's altogether. We found anold fridge factory, appealed to
our supporters to pre-order enoughunits to finance a refit, helped
build the market and Greenfreeze wasborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
andfuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never workand the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in theindustry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that was then, and this is now. Today there are over
100million Greenfreeze refrigerators in theworld, produced by all
the major European, Chinese, Japanese and Indianmanufacturers. It
is now available in most major markets with theexception of North
America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in
thedomestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued touse refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to theSydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such asUnilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors, to
live up to theguidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ More on the &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/"&gt;history of
Greenfreeze&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coke in the spotlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after a concerted online
campaign(CokeSpotlight.org)before the 2000 Olympics to buy green
refrigeration for new units.Before the start of the games all three
companies we had targeted&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/top-companies-ditch-climate-wr/"&gt;
announced phase outplans&lt;/a&gt; for damaging refrigeration
technologies by the time of the 2004Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Coke plans to install no less than6,350climate-friendly
coolers and vending machines in the Olymic Gamesvenues in Beijing
and six co-host cities throughout China. Calculatedbased on an
expected ten year life span of the units, they reducegreenhouse gas
emissions by approximately 4,500 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isthe first time that 100 percent of the coolers and
vending machinesprovided by Coca-Cola to all Olympics venues will
feature HFC-freeinsulation, and HFC-free natural refrigerant. For
good measure, Cokehas also added a proprietary technology called
Energy Management System(EMS) that improves energy efficiency by
more than 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thisinnovative approach of combining natural refrigerants and
energyefficient technology is a great example of how a business can
workwith other stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We
hopeCoca-Cola's efforts can accelerate industry-wide actions to
combatclimate change," said LO Sze Ping, Campaign and
CommunicationsDirector of Greenpeace China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's next for HFC's  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by Coca-Cola, the&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL1475766720070914"&gt;
Whitehouseis rumouredto beplanning an announcement&lt;/a&gt; at next
week's UN meeting on ozone depletingsubstances (the Montreal
Protocol), proposing aggressive targets tophase-out HFC gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, HFC's are expected tocontribute up to 5.2
percent of the world's global warming emissions by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take much more than publicpronouncements to tackle the
climate crisis. But as the Montreal Protocol comes to it's 20th
anniversary, and the story ofGreenfreeze demonstrates, creativity,
vigilance and a "can do!"attitude can transform even the most
familiar/dire characters andsituations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Coke-Olympics"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Earlier this month a group of Islamic scholars and clerics, the Ulamas of Jepara, issued a fatwa against a proposed nuclear plant in their community.  We've been supporting the thousands of locals already protesting against this plant. And yesterday, we took the protest to the energy company's own headquarters with one of our classic banner hanging actions.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists scaled the PT Medco Energi Internasional headquarters, to hang a 30-meter long banner proclaiming "Medco Hands off Nuclear" in central Jakarta.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The fatwa&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa"&gt;fatwa&lt;/a&gt; is a
religious ruling based on Islamic law.  Before issuing thefatwa
against the nuclear plant, the group of scholars and clericsheard
all sides of the argument.   They consulted scientists,
energyindustry experts, community leaders, environmental activists
and theQuran.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After long deliberation they issued their finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraam"&gt;haraam&lt;/a&gt;. The negative
impacts far outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is dangerous because of its radioactivity. Nuclear
poweris dangerous because there is no known way to properly deal
withnuclear waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority
nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The nuclear plant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is fast-tracking plans to build its first nuclear
reactor inJepara, on the island of Java, where an earthquake killed
more than2,735 people in May 2006, and where the Mount Merapi
volcano isthreatening to erupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear energy is an inherently dangerous option for our
country. Let's not forget that Indonesia is located in the main
volcanic chainof the planet, known as 'Pacific ring of fire' and at
the joints oftectonic plates, which makes it vulnerable to
earthquakes"said Energy campaigner Nur Hidayati of Greenpeace. "It
is a moral andethical obligation for the Indonesian government not
to put the livesof millions of Indonesian citizens and future
generations at risk, especially not forthe short sighted interests
of a handful elites."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company behind the plan, PT Medco Energi Internasional, is
askingfor US$3 billion to build a 2000 MW nuclear power plant
by2016.  But both the timeline and the (already large) price tag
areunrealistic.  Hardly any of the currently 435 commercial
nuclearreactors in operation world-wide have been built within the
plannedtime frames or budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why is Medco pushing hazardous nuclear and dirty coal, which
arenothing but obstacles for solutions to climate change and
energysecurity?" said Hidayati.  "Why is Medco overlooking the
abundance ofproven and safe alternatives for producing electricity
from renewablesources including geothermal, solar, micro-hydro,
wind and biomass?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What we're doing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The good news: The biggest environmental gathering of government leaders in many years showed the world is finally waking up to the urgency of climate change.  The bad news: Time is running out.

            View of the front of the Grey Glacier where it 'calves' or falls into the glacial lake. The glaciers of Patagonia are some of the fastest retreating glaciers on Earth. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, world leaders gathered in New York City for the
largest United Nations meeting on climate change since the Rio
Earth Summit in 1992.  Top officials from 150 countries (including
80 heads of state) plus big names like Al Gore and Arnold
Schwarzenegger were in attendance - and so were we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The time for doubt has passed," as UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon said in his opening address.  Ban sees the world's response
to global warming as something that, "will define us, our era, and
ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore told the world leaders, "We have to overcome the paralysis
that has prevented us from acting".  Governor Schwarzenegger called
for, "action, action, action".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one, heads of state stood up and essentially echoed their
sentiments.  Our own Lo Sze Ping, from Greenpeace China, told the
attendees that the world's worst per capita emitting countries need
to stop using developing countries as an excuse not to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo went on to call for an energy revolution with massive uptake
in energy saving and renewable energy technology world wide, and
real action by world leaders rather than more talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the climate negotiations in December, you must therefore
agree to nothing short of a Bali Mandate," he said. "Not a road map
to nowhere, not a wish list."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/climatechange/highlevel/index.asp?go=d070924"&gt;
Watch the webcast&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/un-lo-sze-ping-speech/"&gt;
Read his speach&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bali Mandate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting on climate change negotiations under the Kyoto
Protocol will take place on the island of Bali in December.
Greenpeace is pushing for world leaders to strengthen the Kyoto
Protocol at these meetings. Industrialized countries must begin the
process of negotiating emissions reductions of 30 percent by 2020,
and at least 80 percent by 2050 in order to prevent climate chaos. 
This is what the best and latest science tells us is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings in Bali must advance a negotiating agenda, a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;
Bali Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, to combat climate change on all fronts, including
adaptation, mitigation, clean technologies, deforestation and
resource mobilization. All countries must do what they can to reach
agreement by 2009, and to have it in force at the end of the
current Kyoto Protocol commitment period at the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;US remains isolated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President George W. Bush was not among the heads of state at
the high level UN climate change meeting.  He only showed up late
at the end of the day to dine with a select group.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Bush has scheduled his own &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/guide-to-major-climate-meetings/"&gt;
meeting&lt;/a&gt; for this Thursday and Friday in Washington, DC, limited
to the countries with the largest global warming emissions.  Bush's
meeting, imaginatively dubbed the "Major Emitters Meeting", is
widely seen as part of his strategy to avoid legally binding caps
on greenhouse gas emissions.  Instead, Bush is pushing for
voluntary, "aspirational" targets with no weight behind them. Bush
is just pretending to care. The world must not be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ban_ki-moon_leipold070920/"&gt;
our meeting with Ban&lt;/a&gt;, last Wednesday, Greenpeace USA executive
director, John Passacantando, reassured the UN Secretary General
that people in the US are ready to tackle climate change, and
dismissed the Big Emitters Meeting as a diversion tactic from a
president no one is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=UN-climate-meet07"&gt;Take the future into your own hands.  Join the 7 steps and we'll help you challenge governments and business to join the energy revolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=UN-climate-meet07"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	People took to the streets in more than 50 locations around the world for the Big Blue March, voicing their support for the world's whales, and calling for an end to commercial whaling. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) opens in Anchorage, Alaska on the 28th May, and more than 70 nations will attend, to discuss the fate of whales throughout our oceans.

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week or so, a "migrating human whale" has been
making its way up America's west coast - from Mexico to Canada and
finally to Alaska. After a Big Blue parade to Anchorage's Captain
Cook Hotel - venue for the IWC - Greenpeace supporters took the
green Alaskan grass to form a human humpback whale.&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest edition of our quarterly Guide to Greener Electronics shows that major electronics firms have made large, green strides since the guide was first launched in August 2006. Nokia still leads, closely followed by Sony Ericsson, Dell and Lenovo.

            Dismantling of laptops to enable testing of individual components and materials for a range of hazardous substances.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; has been our answer to getting the
electronics industry to face up to the problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt;
e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. We want manufacturers to take responsibility for the
unprotected child labourers who scavenge the mountains of cast-off
gadgets created by our gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide ranks the 14 top manufacturers of personal computers
and mobile phones according to their policies and practice on toxic
chemicals and recycling. In the first edition of the Guide from
August 2006, the average score was 4/10. Now every company scores
above 5/10. Click on the version numbers to see how the rankings
have changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Race to the top&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company ranked bottom of previous editions have made
improvements to move up. Lenovo was bottom of the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/Previous-editions/how-the-companies-line-1/"&gt;
first guide&lt;/a&gt; but rapidly improved its chemicals policy and
launched a global takeback program. Apple was bottom of the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/Previous-editions/how-the-companies-line-3/"&gt;
next two editions&lt;/a&gt; but pledged in May to improve its chemical
policy and increase its recycling rate. Sony was bottom of the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/apple-greener-nokia-first-260607/"&gt;
June 07 edition&lt;/a&gt; but has since launched in the US the most
advanced takeback and recycling programme of any company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest movers in the latest guide are &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-so-5/"&gt;
Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-lg-5/"&gt;
LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Both have had their penalty points lifted for
leaving a US industry coalition that lobbies against producer
responsibility for recycling discarded products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International Toxics Campaigner, has
been amazed at the progress the Guide has helped create: "There is
still a long way to go for some, but the momentum is extremely
encouraging. What is very exciting is that while the guide focuses
on brand leaders, the improvements can be seen industry wide".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even companies not featured in the ranking have improved
policies in the race to be greener. PC maker Asus has improved it
environmental policies and an Indian edition of the ranking has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/press/releases/greenpeace-commends-hcl-s-gree"&gt;
lead to improvements&lt;/a&gt; from the two biggest Indian computer
companies, WIPRO and HCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-hp-5/"&gt;
Hewlett Packard&lt;/a&gt; (HP) is the only company who has fallen in each
ranking - over taken by competitors, and weakening its support for
a strong takeback policy. It also still needs to provide concrete
timelines for the complete elimination of hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-pa-5/"&gt;
Panasonic&lt;/a&gt; now languishes at the bottom, despite launching some
products free from the most hazardous chemicals; they fail to deal
with old products responsibly. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-ap-5/"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt;, while not losing points, has dropped to 12th position.
Its newly launched iPhone, and new iMac and iPod lines, still
include the worst toxic chemicals - allowing its competitors to
race ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as driving improvements in company policy there are many
improvements in company practice since the first ranking. More
companies now have free take back programs making it easier to
recycle your old electronics. More products are available without
the worst toxic chemicals like PVC (vinyl) plastic and brominated
flame retardants (BFRs). Motorola and LG have joined Nokia and Sony
Ericsson in selling phones without these toxic chemicals. Sony has
a wide range of products including models of the Walkman,
camcorders and a digital camera that are partially BFR and PVC
free. Panasonic lists examples of PVC free products that include
DVD players, home cinemas, and video players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly comparing the performance of these companies has proven
a highly effective way to bring about quick improvements in their
environmental policies. However, we are still waiting for the
companies to act on their promises to market a computer completely
free of the worst toxic chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/greencomputerchallenge?MM_URL=5thRankingaction"&gt;You can keep the pressure up by writing to the CEO's of the top computer firms to challenge them to produce a greener computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=5thRanking"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite. Not accepting corporate donations means we rely entirely on people like you to help keep us going. Some of our corporate targets spend in a few hours what we spend in an entire year. Please help with anything you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jaguars are tree climbers, but there is no federal law to protecting their forest - so our activists have taken to the trees themselves.  Dressed as jaguars, they're camped in the treetops of the Yungas in a bid to block the bulldozers until a federal law can be passed.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists camp in the tree tops, demanding the implementation of the "law of the Forests".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six days now, the activists have continuously occupied trees
inside a part of the Yungas forest that's a UNESCO Biosphere
Reserve. They'll stay there until "la Ley de Bosques" [the Forest
Law], legislation to protect Argentina's remaining forests, is
agreed by the Argentinean congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Argentina is calling for 1 million signatures to help
get the law passed, and has already collected over 600,000. If you
are Argentinean and have not yet signed, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/cyberacciones/bosques.html?MM_URL=GPI-feature"&gt;
please help by signing now&lt;/a&gt;.  While support from all is welcome,
we need signatures from Argentineans to get this law through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees the activists are living in are up to 25 metres high. 
A 'land team', camping on the forest floor, supports the activists
in the trees, and all of them are trained in jungle survival
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Argentinean forests going fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina's forests are in crisis. Forests are being chopped
down at a rate 8 times faster than the world average, clear cutting
a massive 300,000 hectares a year. To put that figure into context
- Argentina destroys an area of forest the size of 40 football
fields, every HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear cutting means just that; giant bulldozers with anchor
chains knock down all vegetation. Any "debris" is then cleared with
fire, in a matter of days ancient ecosystems are lost - forever.
The land is then used to grow genetically engineered soya, or for
cattle ranching. Jaguars are just one of endangered species, facing
extinction as a result of Argentina's rampant forest destruction,
others include armadillos and giant anteaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is also one of the biggest sources of greenhouse
gas emissions. Worldwide deforestation is second only to the energy
sector as a contributor to climate change - responsible for up to
one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Law will establish a moratorium on forest conversion
for agriculture land, until a legitimate scheme for sustainable use
of Argentina's remaining forests is established. This needs to be a
transparent process, including indigenous and campesinos (peasant)
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reserva de la Biosfera de las Yungas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yungas rainforest is considered an international hot spot
for biodiversity by international bodies. Back in 2002, UNESCO
declared an area of the Yungas rainforests in Argentina as
'Biosphere Reserve' because of its rich and unique biodiversity.
The official name of the reserve is 'Reserva de la Biosfera de las
Yungas'. Greenpeace volunteers have chosen to occupy trees inside
this reserve, to highlight how even protected areas, are under
threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 34,000 people live in the Reserve and it is home to some
203 different bird species, including the eagle and the military
macaw; its 89 mammal types include the jaguar and the tapir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the UNESCO classification is to contribute
towards sustainable development and conservation. The expansion of
genetically engineered soya cultivation in Argentina makes a
mockery of Las Yungas Biosphere Reserve status, destroying its
unique ecosystems and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers will remain in the treetops until the Argentinean
senators takes urgent action to give green light to the forests law
and protect what's left of Argentinean forests.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are Argentinean please don't forget to join the hundreds of

<item><language>en</language><title>Island contaminated by illegal GMO</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/island-contaminated-050907/</url><text>
	Environmental activists today placed an entire island under strict quarantine after finding illegal genetically modified (GMO) soya being grown there. 
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/9/greenpeace-activists-put-brail.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists put Braila island, on the Danube river, under quarantine, after Greenpeace field investigations revealed that illegal Genetically Modified (GMO) Soya, is being grown and harvested there.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bralia Island in Romania is normally a quiet farming area on the
Danube river but now it is the site of a huge environmental
contamination by soya that has been genetically modified by the
agricultural-chemical company, Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful action in Romania began early in the morning when
30 Greenpeace activists from across Europe set up a
'decontamination station' at the ferry harbour area on Braila
Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All vehicles leaving the island were decontaminated by being
thoroughly washed to prevent the genetic contamination from
spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for member states of the European Union (EU) which
includes Romania, to cultivate GMO Soya. Greenpeace is calling on
the Romanian government and the European Commission to act
immediately to locate and destroy all of the illegally cultivated
GMO Soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have taken action to protect the rest of Romania from
contamination by these illegal GMO crops, which pose massive risks
to the environment, biodiversity and human heath. Romanian people
have overwhelmingly rejected GMO," said Gabriel Paun, Greenpeace
Romania, GMO campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not the first time Greenpeace has discovered illegal
GMO production in Romania, the situation is out of control. The
Government must immediately locate and destroy all of the crops
before they enter the food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as activists were decontaminating Bralia Island
in Romania, more activists were busy taking action against another
site of GMO contamination in France. 20 volunteers painted a field
of illegally grown GMO maize (corn) bright red, in order to expose
its location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMO maize, known as MON810, is another genetically modified
product being pushed onto consumers by Monsanto. The GMO maize is
being illegally grown, as either the farmer, or the French
government have failed to inform the public of its presence as
required under French law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By failing to take control, the Romanian and French governments
are allowing biotech companies such as Monsanto, to run riot over
their environment and ignore the wishes of European people;
contaminating their food and their fields" said Myrto Pispini,
Greenpeace International GMO campaigner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Get your free e-zine to keep up to date on how you can protect the environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Help keep our food GMO free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After officials from 158 countries meeting in Vienna agreed the next steps for negotiating phase two of Kyoto, the world now turns its gaze southward towards the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Sydney to see if some of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases can rise to the challenge.

            Newcastle, Sunday 2nd September 2007. Greenpeace activists enter the world's biggest coal port at Newcastle and paint the message "Australia Pushing Export Coal" on the side of a coal ship.The message was part of a peaceful protest to expose the Australian Government's real APEC agenda: to protect Australia's coal export industry by undermining the Kyoto Protocol.(c)Greenpeace/Morris.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE Sept 8th: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/news-and-events/media/releases/climate-change/apec-declaration-a-sydney-dist"&gt;APEC declaration a Sydney distraction from action on climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vienna climate change meeting agreed that a cut in
greenhouse gas emission in the range of 25-40 per cent below 1990
levels, by 2020 provides a useful initial parametre to set future
emission reductions by industrialised countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the agreement, some countries were pushing for smaller
reductions targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Russia and Switzerland tried to
introduce lower emission reduction ranges that, if adopted, would
lead to higher greenhouse gas levels, and a much greater risk of
dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positions supported by these countries could lead to a 4ºC
global mean temperature increase or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep climate change from spiralling out of control, we need
to see emission cuts which keep global temperature rise as far
below 2ºC as possible, compared to pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia too has been trying to weaken global emissions targets
by refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol along with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the APEC meeting in Sydney began, Greenpeace activists warned
the many heads of state at the meeting of Australia's real climate
policy by painting the message "Australia Pushing Export Coal" in
two metre high letters along the side of a coal ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Australia's climate policy is to 'Push Export Coal' and to hell
with the consequences for the planet," says Ben Pearson, Greenpeace
energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Real action on climate change means moving away from coal and
shifting to clean, renewable energy - and we don't have the luxury
of time for expensive talk-fests that have no concrete
outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During week long APEC meeting, Australia will export more than
four million tonnes of coal, resulting in over 11 million tonnes of
CO2 emissions - equivalent to the annual emissions from 800,000
average Australian households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factoring in the costs of climate change impacts, as detailed in
the Stern Review, Australia's coal exports will result in more than
AUS$1.2 billion (US$1 billion) of damage during the APEC week
alone, and AUS$64 billion (US$52 billion) annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the world more Greenpeace activists blocked
a Canadian coal shipment. The activists painted the words "No Coal.
No Nuclear. Clean Energy." on the freighter's hull to press
politicians in Ontario to commit to renewable sources of
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UN Secretary General to Greenpeace:  "We need you to mobilize public opinion"</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ban_ki-moon_leipold070920/</url><text>
	Ban Ki-Moon knows a thing or two about climate change and, as head of the UN, the world’s top diplomat knows a thing or two about politics.  When our own executive director, Dr. Gerd Leipold, got in the lift at the UN bound for the 38th floor, he came to ask Ban for strong leadership at the UN climate change meeting on Monday (24th).
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon meets with Greenpeace.  From left to right: Daniel Mittler, Athena Ronquillo, Gerd Leipold, Ban Ki-moon, Jamie Choi and John Passacantando.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Secretary General has real moral authority. We hope that
Ban Ki-moon will use it to call for a "Bali Mandate". What's that?
It's what we need to get out of the biggest climate negotiations in
over a decade that will take place in Bali, Indonesia at the end of
the year. It's a rescue plan for planet earth, which will result in
a strengthened Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ban and Leipold discussed climate change -  both agreeing about
the urgency of the situation and moral imperative of taking
concrete action based upon equity to protect people and the planet
from runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Secretary General laid it out for us: "We need you,
Greenpeace, to mobilize public opinion and enable politicians to do
the right thing." Putting the ball squarely in our court and that
of our supporters. Strong leadership is only half of the equation;
public pressure is the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Greenpeace delegation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Greenpeace staff joined in the meeting.  To show our
diversity, and to deliver their own messages:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;John Passacantando&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, ably represented those
in the US that do not endorse the position and intransigence of the
Bush administration. Passacantando told how people in the US are
already addressing the climate emergency.  He also urged the
Secretary General to ignore Bush's "big emitters" conference next
week, dismissing it as a diversion tactic from a president no one
is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jamie Choi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, a young Korean activist working for Greenpeace China,
described how the energy revolution is already underway in Asia. 
Adding that many young people have grown impatient with slow moving
governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Athena Ronquillo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Mittler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, two of our policy experts, who've been first hand participants
through years of climate change political meetings, were also
there.  Ronquillo gave a quick outline of what we'll be doing in
the next few months to ramp up the pressure on politicians on the
Road to Bali and how we will push for a meaningful mandate to
tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Two climate meetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meeting with the General Secretary is a prelude to the UN
'informal' Climate Summit on Monday, September 24th, in New York,
with some 80 heads of state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this meeting next week, we are again among the speakers
addressing delegates and heads of state. Greenpeace China campaign
director Sze Ping will talk about our work there, and how China can
be part of the solution to climate change.  And he will deliver the
message of our energy revolution: We have to technology we need. We
just need to use energy smarter and ensure a massive uptake of
renewable energies and we can still avert climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later next week, the Bush administration will host its own
climate change meeting, scheduled to start September 27th in
Washington, DC.  This is the so-called "big emitters" meeting since
it's for the 16 countries that account for 90 percent of global
warming emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush is expected to keep pushing the idea of "aspirational
targets".  They are nothing legally binding or meaningful. At best,
they are a random wish list - that will still result in a cooked
planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be at the meeting too, providing analysis,
comment and opposition to this distraction from the real task.  We
need real commitment at the next climate talks. Not more fluff.
"The clock is ticking", Ban Ki-moon told us yesterday. There truly
is no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not have an invitation to the UN, but you've got an
invitation from us.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=Ban-meet"&gt;Join the 7
steps programme.&lt;/a&gt;  We'll send you seven emails over seven weeks
with simple ways you can put the heat on politicians and business
leaders. We need your help over the next few months to increase
political pressure on the road to Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

	Back in April, at the World Bank's spring meeting, there was much talk about the plight of the Congo rainforest. We'd just published a big report detailing how in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) logging titles were being granted in breach of a moratorium that the bank had been instrumental in establishing. The report launch was so high profile, we were able to force DRC's rainforest high onto the agenda of the World Bank meeting and have also managed to secure another session at the upcoming autumn meeting. 
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/8/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Illegal logging under way.  It only takes ten minutes to cut down trees like this one, which can be as old as 200 years. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this, you might be surprised to learn that the World Bank
is investing in a company that is dealing in illegal timber from
the rainforest and has also obtained land in breach of the
country's moratorium. But that's exactly what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank's website says that "the Bank does not fund
logging anywhere in Africa and our main advice to the Government of
DRC is not to expand industrial logging". Yet the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank Group, has
invested heavily in Singapore-based trading group Olam
International to the tune of millions of dollars over the past four
years - at the end of the financial year for 2006, IFC held US$11.2
million in the company's loans and guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks ago, we heard that the DRC provincial authorities
had seized illegal timber shipments from Olam due to non-payment of
local taxes - the barges were carrying $500,000 of illegally-logged
rainforest timber. The area's forest minister CoCo Pembe accused
the company of trading in illegal timber, cut by local companies
whose logging permits have expired. Yet the World Bank denies that
IFC is doing anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have clear evidence that Olam has purchased
logging titles in breach of the 2002 moratorium which expressly
forbids the allocation of more land for logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Right hand not talking to left?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that the left hand of the World Bank doesn't know
what the right hand is doing, and it's not just this distant and
impersonal institution exhibiting double standards - some high
street banks are also funding forest trashing activities. Take
HSBC, whose recent advertising campaign would lead you to believe
it was the greenest bank around. Its 'Forest Land and Forest
Products Sector Guidelines' state that it "will not provide
facilities and other forms of financial assistance [for] logging
operations that are in violation of local or national laws in
respect of illegal logging". And yet, along with the Royal Bank of
Scotland, they provide financial services directly to Olam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When questioned by our campaigners about the relationship with
Olam, HSBC CEO Stephen Green said that he was unable to comment
further on the relationship for "legal and regulatory reasons"
although he was keen to reassure us that "where issues are brought
to my attention they are thoroughly investigated and acted upon if
they are found to be in conflict with our environmental standards
and policies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All well and good, Stephen, but surely the point of having a
sound environmental policy is to prevent HSBC getting into bed with
dodgy companies in the first place. Especially companies like Olam,
whose activities directly contradict HSBC's own forest policy. Mind
you, it's not just HSBC - both Barclays and Prudential are
shareholders in Olam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If financial institutions put their money quite literally where
their mouth is, they can force companies to adopt more responsible
practices - without investment, companies like Olam can't continue
to make vast profits from environmental destruction. The World Bank
could look a bit more closely at its own guidelines and make sure
its funds are used to increase forest protection and alleviate
poverty instead of funding rainforest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it's always worth looking more closely at what your
own bank gets up to - without our hard-earned cash, they can't
function either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=Congo-WorldBank"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and join the thousands of people who take action to protect our environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Congo-WorldBank"&gt;With your support, we can continue to protect ancient forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our planet's oceans are in deep, deep, peril, says a new report from the Worldwatch Institute.  The only road to recovery may be to declare 40 percent of the world's oceans off-limits to human exploitation to ensure the restoration of life in depleted areas.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth's surface is 70 percent covered by ocean, and
three-quarters of humanity live in coastal areas. We are hugely
dependent on marine resources - yet our oceans are facing threats
that include overfishing, toxic pollution, climate change and
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 160%; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;
Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5352?utm_campaign=oceans_in_peril&amp;amp;utm_medium=link_exchange&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace.org" target="_blank"&gt;new report from the prestigious Worldwatch
Institute, Oceans in Peril: Protecting Marine Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;,
calls for these marine reserves - areas where all extractive and
destructive activities, including fishing are prohibited - while
giving an alarming snapshot of the shocking state of the world's
oceans. It's a wake-up call that should jolt the complacency of
policy makers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written for the Worldwatch Institute by a team of experts - this
time from the Greenpeace Science Unit in the UK's Exeter University
- Oceans in Peril updates an earlier study by the same team in
1998. They have been staggered by the scale and rate of destruction
that has taken place in less than a decade in every ocean on
Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science Unit provides crucial scientific expertise to our
campaigns, and has a long history of working on oceans issues,
including whaling, toxic pollution, climate change and
overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recent studies such as the one which shows how 90 percent of
the world's large predatory fish, which include the sharks,
swordfish and tuna, have disappeared due to overfishing since the
1950s have helped expose what has been happening under the waves
and have therefore been out of sight and out of mind to most
people", says Paul Johnston, Greenpeace's chief scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril details new and emerging threats, such the
increasing acidification of the world's oceans, and underscores how
the race for ever-diminishing resources is forcing marine
ecosystems to the point of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report illustrates how 76 percent of the world's fish stocks
are fully or overexploited, an estimate borne out by figures from
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which
suggest that 158 million tons of fish were harvested worldwide in
2005 - a seven-fold increase since 1950.  Catch records between
1950 and 2000 show the "collapse" of 366 out 1,519 fisheries
worldwide, most famously the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/no-cod-blame-the-seals/"&gt;
Grand Banks cod fishery&lt;/a&gt; off Newfoundland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25292/a-good-catch-of-orange-roughy.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;©Greenpeace/Grace Orange Roughy and
bycatch in the Tasman Sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril also details the pitfalls of fish farming, the
supposed magic bullet of marine resources with alarming statistics:
producing carnivorous animals such as salmon or marine shrimp
requires 2.5 as much fishmeal as the amount of saleable fish
eventually produced. For tuna caught in the wild and fattened in
"ranches", the weight of fish fed to the tuna is a shocking 20
times more than what is actually produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage to thousands of marine animals and entire ecosystems
by the likes of longlining and bottom trawling, as well as
overfishing off the coast of developing countries, is exacerbated
the estimated 20 percent of the global catch that is illegal,
unregulated or unreported, and worth somewhere between US$4-9
billion a year. While countries with enough resources to control
their own waters stand some chance of putting measures in place to
protect resources, there's little or no regulation of any kind of
marine harvesting in international waters - an issue that needs to
be urgently addressed at an international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not all doom and gloom - there is a beam of sunshine in
the report, including a comprehensive package of measures that if
implemented could reverse current trends, restoring the former
productivity of our planet's oceans. That solution is the
establishment of comprehensive marine reserves all over the world, 
protecting vulnerable species and habitats, enhancing fisheries
beyond the reserve boundaries, and buffering the worst impacts of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine reserves are the single most powerful tool available for
arresting and reversing the decline of our oceans and are equally
applicable to the high seas as they are to coastal waters. The
oceans have immense powers of regeneration and wherever in the
world marine reserves have been established marine life is
flourishing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The nuclear industry recently launched a multi-million dollar campaign to try and revive the most expensive, dangerous, and polluting way to boil water ever invented. Spain is having none of it. The nation's president has confirmed that the country's 8 operating plants will be phased out in favour of clean, renewable energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For the same investment, wind generates 5 times the jobs and 2.3 times the power as a nuclear reactor.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry lobby groups have been trying to sell 10 new nuclear
plants inSpain, and have fought hard for legislation that would
allow existingplants to operate past their planned retirement
dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ButPresident José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has confirmed the
government'scommitment to the phase-out in his State of the Nation
address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Zapatero has shown true leadership in preparing the phase out
of this dangerous and polluting problem and phasing in safe
renewable energy sources," said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace
International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All across the world the nuclear industry is drowning in debt,
controversy and its massive waste issues. It is only kept afloat by
the likes of Blair and Bush who are pouring billions of dollars of
public money into an industry which reached the end of its life
over a decade ago."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a national coalition of environmentaland
civic groups which on May 20th unanimously petitioned thegovernment
to deliver on election promises of "safer, cleaner, cheaper"energy.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zapatero agreed not only to the phase-out, but toa widely
consultative process to find a solution to what to do withexisting
radioactive waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to resurrect a failing industry, regular claims of a
nuclear power revival have been made - the most recent using
climate change as an excuse to spend further billions to build more
reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But renewable energy is now taking the lead, with a single
source such as wind energy adding more than 6,000 megawatts to the
European grid every year, the equivalent to two large nuclear
reactors. In only a few years, wind power in Spain has grown to 8
percent of the national electricity production. In 2005 alone, some
1680 megawatts of new wind power were installed, generating four
times as much electricity as the Zorita nuclear power plant which
Spain closed last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain joins Sweden, Germany, Italy and Belgium as the fifth
European country to abandon nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=SpainAdiosNukesStoryAction"&gt;Get our free monthly e-zine to find out how you can take part in the energy revolution, substituting safe, clean, renewables for nuclear and fossil fuels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=RadChampaignDonate"&gt;Donate and become a member today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Blix calls for removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/blix-to-us-nukes-out-of-nato010606/</url><text>
	A new report from the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission to the UN makes some surprising recommendations - among them the removal of US nuclear weapons from NATO countries. It also fundamentally challenges the Bush Administration's nuclear weapons programme and policies of pre-emptive attack. There are 480 US nuclear weapons currently stationed in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, Italy, and the UK.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-activists-use-barre.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2004/9/greenpeace-activists-use-barre.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            US nuclear missiles in Europe are a provocation to proliferation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, Weapons of Terror, is authored by a commission
chaired by former International Atomic Energy Agency head Hans
Blix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report criticizes all countries involved in the
proliferation debate. Iran is not excluded for its continued
obfuscation nor the US for its illegal doctrine of pre-emption and
its more than 5,000 nuclear weapons, which are described as a major
provocation to further proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace received the report a day early when Greenpeace
Policy Advisor Felicity Hill stumbled upon a copy accidentally
released at the &lt;a href="http://www.wmdcommission.org/"&gt;WMDC
website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was available for several hours before being withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the world watches with concern at the heated political
negotiation over Iran's nuclear programme and holds its breath to
see what the US will do next, Blix and his team have produced a
state-of-the-art report on all of the pressures and problems
surrounding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," said
Ms. Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report clearly states that the nuclear weapon states are in
breach of their Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) commitment to disarm
and "no longer seem to take their commitment to nuclear disarmament
seriously - even though this was an essential part of the NPT
bargain, both at the treaty's birth in 1968 and when it was
extended indefinitely in 1995."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of thing we have been saying for decades - but
which rarely features in the UN Security Council, dominated as it
is by the five permanent members, all of whom possess nuclear
weapons.  Far from disarming, they're actually upgrading their
arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also observes: "While the reaction of most states to
the treaty violations was to strengthen and develop the existing
treaties and institutions, the US, the sole superpower, has looked
more to its own military power for remedies. The US National
Security Strategy of 2002 made it clear that the US would feel free
to use armed force without authorization of the United Nations
Security Council to counter not only an actual or imminent attack
involving WMD but also a WMD threat that might be uncertain as to
time and place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question remains: will the US continue to undermine
international diplomacy, or heed Blix's call to, in effect,  lead
by the force of its example rather than the example of its
force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One ghost of Blix's former job of promoting nuclear power pops
up when the commission recommends providing nuclear fuel to Iran in
a "managed safeguarded and controlled" manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reject the notion that supplying nuclear fuel to anyone will
help reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation.  Having the means
to make nuclear energy means having the means to make  nuclear
weapons. It is the most expensive, unsustainable and dangerous ways
to boil water ever invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only sensible way to combat proliferation is to remove the
sources of proliferation and that includes nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having correctly identified the problem the WMDC reaches the
wrong conclusion. In recognising that nuclear power and nuclear
weapons are inextricably linked the only rational conclusion is to
reject nuclear power. Instead the world should urgently take up the
challenge of developing and deploying renewable energy sources
which have the benefit of being both climate-friendly and have no
weapons utility whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No notion of controlling and safeguarding the production,
transport and use of nuclear weapons materials can ever be one
hundred percent guaranteed, and the only way to eliminate the risk
of diversion or theft by terrorists is to eliminate the materials
themselves which means no nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/nuclear/disarmament/us-nuclear-warplans-against-ir?MM_URL=NATOactionFromBlixStory"&gt;Tell NATO to say "NO" to US Nuclear weapons in Europe.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUBlixNukestory"&gt;We don't accept donations from corporations or governments, so we can name and shame and bring you stories like these without being compromised.

	The Paradise Forests weblog features contributions from international volunteers at the Global Forest Rescue Station in Lake Murray, a remote area in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea.Our campaigners and activists on board our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, also sent through blogs, as they sailed around the region on 'Forest Crime Patrol'.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/sep-galeva-of-the-kuni-tribe.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/sep-galeva-of-the-kuni-tribe.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sep Galeva, of the Kuni tribe, invited Greenpeace and other organisations to help the people of Lake Murray establish eco-forestry projects. Sep is pictured as the first eco-timber shipment is loaded onto a barge.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, we set up a China Forest Rescue Station, as most of
theillegally logged timber from the Paradise Forests is sent to
China forprocessing into cheap wood products, then exported or sold
to thegrowing domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG landowner Brian Barring contributed blogs as he travelled
throughEurope and the UK, spreading the word about the situation in
hishomeland. The UK and EU countries are also big consumers of
illegallylogged timber products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weblog brings the fight to save the Paradise Forests to
life. Itdraws us in to the Lake Murray community. We share the
commitment ofthe volunteers and the joy of the landowners as their
shared dream - toestablish sustainable, small-scale, eco-forestry
projects - became areality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Lukautim Bus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Lukautim Bus' was the Pidgin slogan for our campaign. It
means'Protect Our Forest' or, using a more literal translation,
'Look AfterOur Bush'. The slogan was unveiled on the Rainbow
Warrior, as itarrived in Port Moresby to a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/02/lukautim_bus.html"&gt;
traditional welcome&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign had officially kicked
off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the GFRS, our first lucky volunteers were trying to get the
hang oftheir new way of life. Europeans Flo and Klaas were
determined to mastthe art of canoeing, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/ahunting_we_will_go.html"&gt;
hunting&lt;/a&gt; and fishing, so they could become part of the group -
"&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/02/boy_bilong_grup_1.html"&gt;
boy bilong grup&lt;/a&gt;" in Pidgin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flo and Klaas became so adept at their new hunter-gatherer
lifestyle,they even took on the task of providing food for the camp
themselves - &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/tall_tales_from_the_fireside.html"&gt;
or so they say!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Setting sail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After holding &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/dancing_from_png_to_panama.html"&gt;
open day&lt;/a&gt; for the public, the Warrior &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/out_to_sea.html"&gt;
farewells&lt;/a&gt; their new Port Moresby friends and sets off. The next
stop is Jayupura, in Papua, where the ship receives another &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/arrival_in_jayapura.html"&gt;
colourful welcome&lt;/a&gt;. The local campaigners hold an &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/forum_guests_favour_community.html"&gt;
eco-forestry forum&lt;/a&gt;and many influential people attend, including
the Governor of Jayapura,the Provincial Forest Minister,
spokespeople from NGOs and leaders ofmore than 15 Papuan
tribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/manokwari_welcome.html"&gt;
Manokwari&lt;/a&gt;, the campaigners and crew held a similar forum at the
&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/cool_school_the_panel_discussi.html"&gt;
local university&lt;/a&gt;, which actually had it's own forest out the
back! After so long at sea, it was a welcome sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Stop trashing my forest!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Brian saw &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/everything_is_covered_with_sno.html"&gt;
snow for the first time in his life&lt;/a&gt;. Battling the cold weather
- and adjusting to a European diet of bread,bread and more bread -
Brian took his message to the media, civilservants and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/its_so_cold.html"&gt;
politicians&lt;/a&gt;as he made his way around Europe. In the UK he
delivered an impassionedplea to Alchemy Partners, whose company,
Montague L Meyer, sellsplywood made from Bintangor and other
tropical species.  Brian'smessage was simple and direct: "&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/post_1.html"&gt;
Stop trashing my forest!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A taste of Paradise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Brian, the volunteers at the GFRS were coming to terms with
beingfar, far from home. Life at 'Camp Kewe' gave them a new
appreciation ofjust how much the forest means to the people of Lake
Murray. It reallyis their 'supermarket'. They go there to find
everything they need -not just &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/a_taste_of_the_rainforest.html"&gt;
food&lt;/a&gt;, but all the materials they need for shelter and transport
(&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/the_dugout_canoe_highway.html"&gt;
dug-out canoes&lt;/a&gt;) too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new lifestyle bought with it certain dilemmas. Flo and
Klaasencountered a dangerous snake (a death adder) which they
implored thelocal boys &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/a_forest_dilemma_and_a_farewel.html"&gt;
not to kill&lt;/a&gt;. Their regret is relayed through the blog; while
writing it, theyreached a new understanding of the realities of
forest life. They,after all, had never lost a friend or relative to
a snake bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Merel's conscious effort to avoid any
offensive thatturning down a local delicacy (turtle soup) would
cause, led her to a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/the_benefits_of_being_a_vegeta.html"&gt;
chance meeting&lt;/a&gt;with some local women - one of whom needed a lift
to the local hospitalwith her newborn baby. Of course, the GFRS
team were happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of soup, the Warrior, en route to Jakarta, came across
&lt;a href="%20http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/a_bowl_of_soup_from_papua.html"&gt;
shark fisherman&lt;/a&gt;whose plight reminded Hapsoro that poor
communities aren't just rippedoff for their forest products.  These
fishermen worked hard tocatch sharks in open water. Their spoils
are sold at well below themarket rate, because the demand for cheap
marine products drives pricesdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Getting down to business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volunteers at the GFRS were there to work, and work they
did. Together with the landowners and foresters from the Foundation
forPeople and Community Development (FPCD), they set about marking
theboundaries of the land owned by the various clans at Lake
Murray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While small teams of volunteers were off boundary marking,
othersjoined landowners for training days in eco-forestry. The
trainingincludes &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/putting_theory_into_practice.html"&gt;
field trips&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the landowners and volunteers to put
their new skills into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As word spread around the lake, more and more clans wanted to
join theeco-forestry project. In order for the clans to set up
theireco-forestry business, they had to map out their land, and
designate ause (hunting, sago plantations, eco-forestry, etc) for
different areas.A local NGO (non-government organisation) called
Barefoot heldworkshops to help with the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/why_is_greenpeace_here.html"&gt;
mapping out&lt;/a&gt;  process, using  sticks, string and different types
of leaves to represent the various areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barefoot also encouraged debate about sustainable
communitydevelopment, and initiated discussions on how each clan
could use theproceeds from eco-forestry to benefit their
village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cause for celebration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People from all over the lake came to see the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/celebrating_the_arrival_of_the.html"&gt;
arrival of the sawmill&lt;/a&gt;. This portable piece of equipment, used
to mill trees into timberon-the-spot, thus causing minimal damage
to the forest, was welcomed tothe region with a traditional 'sing
sing'. FPCD will lease sawmills tolandowners on a buy-back scheme
as their eco-forestry business takesshape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lake Murray received its &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/03/our_first_orders.html"&gt;
first order&lt;/a&gt; - a handwritten note requesting 43 pieces of
eco-timber (around 2 metrecubed). Sep, the leader of the Kuni
tribe, which invited Greenpeace andour partners to Lake Murray,
arranged for a sunken barge to be &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/a_rescued_boat_and_a_dream_com.html"&gt;
refloated&lt;/a&gt;, to transport the eco-timber out. Everything was
falling into place …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bearing witness to forest crime &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out at sea, the crew of the Warrior were confronted with the
realitiesof illegal logging, when it encountered the MV Ardhianto,
a huge cargoship loaded with a slice of the Paradise Forests. It
was being loadedup with timber from the Kayu Lapis Indonesia mill -
known to trade indestructively and illegally logged timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists, including Hapsoro, a campaigner from Indonesia,
hung twobig "Stop Ancient Forest Destruction" banners, as they
watched frominflatables, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/02/hapsoro_forest_campaigner_indo.html"&gt;
bearing witness to the forest crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hapsoro was present again a month later, when the Ardhianto
arrived in Yokohama, Japan, to unload its &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/a_beautiful_tuesday.html"&gt;
devastating cargo&lt;/a&gt;. This time, activists unfurled banners that
asked, "Is this timber legal?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Technology and tradition meet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out in the forest, the boundary marking was coming along in
leaps and bounds, thanks to the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/the_foresters_and_their_gps.html"&gt;
foresters and their GPS&lt;/a&gt;.  FPCD had only recently started using
the Global Positioning Systems. In the past, they used a long tape
measure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Campe Kewe, 18-year-old Susan, of the Yongom tribe, sat down
with Merel, one of the GFRS volunteers, and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/a_blog_from_susan.html"&gt;
wrote a weblog&lt;/a&gt;.  It was the first time Susan had ever used a
computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amele, a forester from FPCD, also contributed a blog, about &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/04/amales_blog_my_life_in_the_lak.html"&gt;
gender equality&lt;/a&gt; on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Behold, eco-forestry!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/05/the_felling_of_the_first_tree.html"&gt;
felling of the first tree&lt;/a&gt;  was a "sombre and dramatic" landmark
in the project. A few days later, when the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/2006/05/behold_ecotimber_the_first_shi.html"&gt;
first shipment&lt;/a&gt;  of eco-timber was loaded onto the barge, Lake
Murray was buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years of planning went into the eco-forestry project. In 2006,
afterthree months of lessons, practice sessions and planning
meetings, thepeople of Lake Murray - and their posse of
international friends -could finally say, "Em Nao: Eco-Timber!"
("Behold: Eco-Timber!").  &lt;/p&gt;

	After two years of investigation, we’ve uncovered a string of illegal soy production that is destroying the Amazon rainforest, and can be traced to a large American corporation: Cargill.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/amazoncargill.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/amazoncargill.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cargill: cutting down the Amazon to feed chickens.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of climbers from our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, shut
downCargill's illegal soy facility in the heart of the Amazon
rainforest.Our activists unfurled a banner on the conveyor belts at
Cargill'sfacility, but angry Cargill employees nearby blasted the
sign down withhigh-powered hoses.  Police arrived on the scene and
arrested 16 of ouractivists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise itself blockaded the Cargill port, preventing
exports of soy from leaving the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nearby city of Santarém, a group of Cargill's
supporterssurrounded the police station holding our activists, but
were dispersedby military police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police securedthe Arctic Sunrise as well, but an angry mob
boarded our shipdespite the police presence, and painted graffiti
along the sides.Fireworks were also aimed at our ship and
activists, even hitting anactivist in the chest, but fortunately
leaving him unharmed. Meanwhile,police used pepper spray toforce
the crew to open the radio room, and took them into custody.
Therest of our activists were put in lockdown within the ship. 
Cargill tug boats pushed our ship out ofthe dock, dragging it and
our anchor out into theTapajos river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal soy Cargill is producing has been linked to a
massive fast food chain, including &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/nothing-yummy-about-amazon-des"&gt;
KFC&lt;/a&gt;'s European restaurants. These fast food chains are
literally eating up the Amazon, and we've detailed exactly how in a
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press/reports/eating-up-the-amazon"&gt;
recent report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers want  to prevent soy fromthe world's most
precious rainforest being exported to Europe to feedchickens, pigs
and cows -- and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/takeaction/kfcaction.html"&gt;
you can help support them by writing to KFC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cargill, based in the United States, is the largest soy producer
andexporter in the Amazon, operating 13 silos in the heart of the
Amazonrainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soy is now a leading cause of rainforest destruction in the
BrazilianAmazon. In total, an estimated 12,000 square miles of what
was oncerainforest has already  been destroyed, mostly illegally,
to growsoybeans. Cargill makes no secret of helping establish soy
farms in theAmazon, some of which are complicit in other illegal
activities such asland grabbing and slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations like Cargill must stop seeing the Amazon as a place
toexpand their soy businesses, and recognise it as the world's
greatestrainforest  in need of urgent protection, not exploitation.
We're calling onCargill, and their fast-food industry customers, to
ensure that thesoy and animal feed they buy does not contribute to
thedestruction of the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/takeaction/kfcaction.html"&gt;Tell KFC you don't want the Amazon cut down to feed chickens.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUkfc"&gt;Help keep us in action: Donate today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Ahhh, a fine Champagne. A delicate nose. Full body. Great colour. And that indescribable sensation when you raise your glass of having your tongue tickled by .... TRITIUM???
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/radionucleotides-might-feature.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/radionucleotides-might-feature.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Will future vintages contain radioactive waste?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raise a toast to the French nuclear industry, whose low-level
radioactive waste is leaking into groundwater less than 10
kilometres (6 miles) from the famous Champagne vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems at a radioactive waste dumpsite in Soulaine were
reported by its operator, ANDRA, to the French nuclear safety
authority on May 24th, 2006.  According to their report "the wall
of a storage cell fissured" while concrete was being added to a
recent layer of waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980's, ANDRA stated categorically that their
dumpsite would not release any radioactivity into the environment.
But that was when they were seeking planning permission. Today, the
French nuclear authority is saying "This event revealed a flaw in
the conception of the storage cells of the site."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/5/champagne-map.jpg" style="margin: 4px; float: left;"&gt;The waste dump, Centre
Stockage l'Aube (CSA) in Soulaine, contains nuclear waste both from
France and abroad. More waste is trucked into the site every week.
Once full, the dumpsite will be one of the world's largest with
over 1 million cubic meters of waste, including plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace research released last week showed levels of
radioactivity leaking from another dumpsite run by ANDRA in
Normandy  -- at  up to 90 times above European safety limits. That
waste has seeped into underground water used by farmers, with
contamination spreading into the countryside and threatening dairy
production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Champagne site will receive a total of 4 thousand
terabequerels of tritium -- more than three times the amount of
tritium waste as the dumpsite in Normandy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;A nuclear waste crisis out of control&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have been told for decades that nuclear dumpsites will not
leak and that the best standards are being applied. In reality the
dumpsite in Normandy is a disaster, and radioactivity is already
leaking from the dumpsite in Champagne," says Shaun Burnie, nuclear
campaigner at Greenpeace International. "The authorities know they
have a problem in Champagne already, with mistakes in the design.
This is only the beginning of the problem, the bigger picture is
that France has a nuclear waste crisis out of control that is
threatening not only the environment and public health but also the
economy of the Champagne region."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="champagne" align="middle" height="375" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the low and intermediate waste site in Soulaine,
a new high-level waste dumpsite is being planned in Bure -- also in
the Champagne region -- in which the most radioactive material in
France would be deposited. Plans to build a high level waste
facility in the Rhone Valley were scrapped a few years ago after
strong opposition by wine producers due to the threat to their
vines and wine production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Champagne producers are facing two nuclear time bombs - one
already leaking at Soulaine, and one planned at Bure. The wine
producers in the Rhone region stood up to the nuclear state in
France and won. The Champagne region needs to act fast before it's
too late," said Fred Marillier of Greenpeace France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The French Government must stop this madness. The new facility
must not accept any more waste, and an immediate investigation
launched into how to stop further contamination of ground
water."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;1,200 tons each year and no place to go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having a nuclear waste crisis the French electricity
providers Electricite de France (EdF) are seeking approval to build
a new reactor at Flamanville, which will increase the amount of
high-level waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today EdF's nuclear reactors produce 1,200 tonnes of highly
radioactive waste every year. The waste expected from the new
reactor would be the most hazardous waste ever produced in a French
nuclear power reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France needs to end its love affair with nuclear power, and
raise a glass to safe, clean, renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=RadChampagneStoryAction"&gt;Get our free monthly e-zine to find out how you can take part in the energy revolution, substituting safe, clean, renewables for nuclear and fossil fuels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=RadChampaignDonate"&gt;Help keep our activists in action and our researchers researching.

	With the strongest warnings yet from the international scientific community on the threat of dangerous climate change just published, it's clearly time to match strengths of scientific warnings with determined action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/2/effiel-tower-claime-action-ipcc.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We highlight the fact that taking action now is vital to prevent dangerous climate change. An increase of global temperature over 2°C is predicted to cause catastrophic climate impacts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest report on the science of climate change from
theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting in
Paris,concluded that continuing polluting business-as-usual
practices islikely to increase global average temperatures between
1.1°C and 6.4° Cabove 1980-1999 levels by 2095, leading to more
droughts, heatwaves,floods and stronger hurricanes, rapid melting
of ice-sheets and rapidlyrising sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=IPCCstoryact" class="act"&gt;Join the energy [r]evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace climate campaigner who was atthe
meeting in Paris said, "The good news is our understanding of
theclimate system and our impact on it has improved immensely. The
badnews is that the more we know, the more precarious the future
looks.There's a clear message to Governments here, and the window
for actionis narrowing fast. If the last IPCC report was a wake up
call, this oneis a screaming siren."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main findings of the IPCC report are summarised below.
Further reports will follow this year on at the probableimpacts of
climate change, options for adapting to those impacts, andpossible
routes to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's a few degrees?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While temperature increases of a few degrees might not sound
sodramatic it will have dramatic effects on our climate. That's why
isvital that action is taken now to reduce emissions and keep
warmingbelow 2°C to prevent catastrophic climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there is a blueprint for how to do this - the
energy(r)evolution. It shows how to halve global CO2 emissions by
2050, usingexisting technology and still providing affordable
energy and economicgrowth. In short - a revolution in energy policy
and an evolution inhow we use energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=5,0,0,0" height="400" width="430"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2007/1/energyrevolutionintro.swf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can have reliable renewable energy, and use energy more
smartly toachieve the cuts in carbon emissions required to prevent
dangerousclimate change. Crucially this can be done while phasing
out damagingand dangerous coal and nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the science of climate change becomes ever more clear and
alarming,public concern is increasing rapidly. One of the few
things notmatching the warning is the scale of real action from
governments toreduce emissions. If this stark warning goes unheeded
futuregenerations, enduring a warmer world of our own making, will
not lookkindly on lack of action at the start of the 21st
Century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Summary of major findings of the IPCC
report&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human impact on climate has now been attributed with a
90percent confidence, higher than in earlier assessments, and has
beenfound in all world regions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An increase in thetheoretical climate 'sensitivity', i.e., how
the climate will respondto a doubling of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere compared topre-industrial levels. Previously, the best
estimate for warming inrelation to GHG doubling was 2.5 degrees
centigrade, and now that hasincreased to 3 degrees centigrade.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Broad confirmation that therange of warming expected by 2100 if
emissions are not reduced is 1.1°Cand 6.4°C by 2095 over 1980-1999
levels (1).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The intensity oftropical storms is likely to increase, a
finding that was not possiblein the Third Assessment Report (TAR).
Observed increases in intensityare highly correlated with increased
sea surface temperature.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TheAntarctic and Greenland ice sheets contributed a substantial
amount(around 15 percent) to the observed increase in sea level
over the1993-2003 period. However, the models say that the
Antarctic ice sheetshould in fact be growing, due to increased
precipitation, meaning thatas yet the models cannot explain the
increase in the discharge of iceespecially from Antarctica, and
don't fully account for the rapidmelting and discharge of ice from
Greenland. So, while it's known thatsea-level rise will probably be
greater, it is still difficult toquantify precisely by how
much.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A warming of 1.9 to 4.6°C abovepre-industrial levels, (well
within the range expected for the 21stcentury) would lead to the
virtual elimination of the Greenland Icesheet, if that warming is
sustained for thousand years or more. Thatwould raise sea level by
between 6 and 7 metres. The report also foundthat future
temperatures projected over Greenland are comparable tothose from a
warm period 125, 000 years ago, when sea levels were 4-6metres
higher than they are today.&lt;/li&gt;

	The island of Hawaii'i, also known as the Big Island. An island filled with contrasts - lush tropical rain forests, grassy rolling hills, dry deserts, sunny beaches and snow capped volcanic peaks ...an alluring and exotic tropical island.   And the world's largest open-air genetic engineering laboratory.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists deliver thousands of contaminated papayas to authorities in Thailand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Island contains the world's greatest concentration of
climate types in one relatively small area. Hawaii has 11 of the
world's 13 climate zones in just over 4000 square miles of terrain.
In the midst of this beauty agro-chemical conglomerates have
exploited this special place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has run more than 4,000 GE field trials to date -- more
 than any other location in the world per square metre.  Corn, soy,
wheat, sugarcane (biopharmaceuticals), orchids, lime tree, sorgum,
cotton, barley and coffee have all been exploited in GE field
trials by a well-funded and greedy agro-chemical industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one GE crop is approved for commercial purposes: the
Papaya. A &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/FailureGEPapayainHawaii" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by Greenpeace demonstrates how it
has devastated the Hawaiian export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/5/papaya-decline.gif" title="Papaya decline" alt="Graph of Papaya market decline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Papaya - fruit with a long history, uncertain future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papaya has been grown in tropical regions of the world for as
long as history has been recorded. This brightly coloured and
unique fruit that we have enjoyed for centuries is under threat, in
Hawaii successful papaya growing and stable export markets were
flourishing up until the commercialisation of genetically
engineered papaya in 1998. Then things changed. Several years after
the GE industry got control over papaya farmers and the papaya they
grow the export market for Hawaiian papaya flatlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii is the only place in the world where GE Papaya is grown
commercially and most of the countries importing Hawaii papaya -
including the EU, Japan and China - have an aversion to GE crops
and foods. Doors started closing on Hawaii's papaya exports and
prices went into free fall. Organic and conventional farmers were
earning up to three times as much for their GE-free papayas. But
the organic exports  are on the downturn now as well,  as it is
harder to guarantee GE-free fruit due to contamination from
neighbouring GE strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"GE papayas are a big issue on this island, science put them
here and now with the help of volunteers and local farmers we are
taking them away," said Terri Mulroy, organic papaya farmer on
Hawaii Island commenting from a recent decontamination event at her
farm. "Once the GE papayas are removed I will be happy again and
hope that all of my remaining papayas are GE-free."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/5/papaya-activist.gif.jpg" style="margin: 4px; float: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Will Thailand learn from Hawaii's mistakes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Thailand, Thais will invite you to partake in one of their
favourite foods - somtam - the green papaya salad eaten daily
throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This traditional dish and Thailand's own papaya export markets
are under threat from the US GE papaya industry as they stretch
their tentacles into South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Thai papaya farmers tainted by GE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although GE Papaya has not been commercialised in Thailand,
mounting pressure is been applied to Thailand by the US
agro-chemical companies and government, which are threatening
current genetic engineering bans. Already, due to a Thai Government
agency's role in the illegal distribution of GE-contaminated papaya
seeds, contamination issues for conventional and organic growers is
an ongoing problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;We don't want it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand has existing bans on the field trial, commercial
planting of GE crops, but this has been under constant assault from
the US and agro-chemical industry, led mainly by US interests. The
GE papaya which caused the ongoing contamination of Thai farms was
developed by the same scientist who introduced Hawaii's problematic
GE papaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Thai Government has attempted to lift the genetic
engineering ban under pressure from the US government and the
agro-chemical industry. However, Thais oppose GE crops because we
don't want to lose the market for our farm crops, like what
happened to Hawaiian papayas, as well as our status as the world's
kitchen," said Patwajee Srisuwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiian and Thai Governments and industry need to pull back
from this economically, environmentally, and export-damaging
technology. They need to look closely at the evidence provided from
both regions and then move towards supporting and nurturing the
conventional and organic papaya growers upon whom, ultimately, the
burden of GE contamination will fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=PapayaStory"&gt;Help us stop the release of genetically engineered organisms in the wild.

	Here's the text of a speech that Greenpeace International Executive Director Gerd Leipold gave at the Public Eye Award ceremony at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The Public Eye on Davos grew out of a public demonstration first organised in 1997 to voice opposition to the WEF and denounce the negative effects of globalization.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist (and International Executive Director) Gerd Leipold. Greenpeace shut down the Esso station in Wasserbillig, on the border of Luxembourg and Germany, as part of a nationwide protest. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Public Eye 2007 in Davos&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Gerd Leipold, International Executive Director, Greenpeace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next four days, we will hear amazing speeches in Davos,
and you might be tempted into thinking some sort of mass conversion
has taken place. Company after company, politician after politician
will lament climate change, express their deep concerns and claim
again to move away from business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: What might have been said at the World Social Forum a
few years ago, has now become the language of the World Economic
Forum. It seems like an astonishing step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's not be naive. Climate change progressed whilst it was
being denied, and it continues to progress,  now that is has been
acknowledged. While the chimneys keep blasting greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere, the hot air from conference rooms will not
make any difference to the real world, no matter how worried the
powerful of the world seem to be, no matter how many crocodile
tears they shed - here in Davos or in the pages of so-called
'sustainability reports'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the world is changing. And that's not
because the powerful acknowledge it, but because the exploitation
of planet Earth continues. We dredge fish out of the oceans faster
than they can reproduce, using destructive industrial fleets which
empty the waters where local fishermen once made their living
sustainably. We cut down ancient forests to grow soya and to
produce disposable wood and paper products such as toilet paper and
plywood. Our immense thirst for burning fossil fuels is saturating
the Earth's atmosphere with greenhouse gases causing glaciers to
melt, sea levels to rise and storms to become more destructive.
Wars are being fought to secure access to oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And make no mistake: Many of the people who indeed have changed
this planet in this way - and continue to do so - will meet and
talk here in Davos this week. But talking's not enough. They have
to take full corporate, political, and personal responsibility, and
act accordingly now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens here at the WEF is no longer a private meeting. As
business leaders see themselves as the promoters of public debate
and decision maker, and as politicians from all over the world
participate, the WEF is no longer a private meeting. Agenda setting
at a private meeting is a predemocratic model. Therefore, we need
openness not just in a few public fora but for all forms of
creative protests of civil society here and elsewhere..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can I justify my participation on behalf of Greenpeace
.in the World Economic Forum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because it is important that the agenda setting is not
left to the powerful. It is because those relatively few delegates
affect the lives of billions of people who are neither present nor
represented at the WEF. It is because someone needs to mention that
good intentions for the future do not replace the responsibility
for the past. It is because those corporations which make genuine
steps forward deserve acknowledgement and support - and those who
only want to do greenwashing, must hear on the spot that they will
not get away with it any longer. It is, because business dominates
so much of people's lives, that we cannot leave it to business
people only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world experiences its biggest environmental crisis and
even the corporations slowly but surely become aware of it, we as
members of civil society face a huge task. It is up to us to create
the pressure that turns their words into actions. It is up to us,
to keep raising the demand for corporate accountability, it is up
to us to compare promises with actions, it us up to us to
distinguish real solutions from window dressing. We have to expose
exploitation and destruction and, by the same token, support
genuine change. We have to insist on and participate in the
democratic debate. We have to claim the space for those who are not
listened to and suffer the most from the environmental damage
caused by the actions, or inactions of those in corporate and
political spheres. In short: It is up to us to put rights over
power, care over money, peace over war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Public Eye stands for. This is the message,
which it has spread for the last eight years very effectively.
Today this symbolic index finger right next to the world's biggest
business is more important than ever. I am more than happy to carry
this message over to the WEF.&lt;/p&gt;

	Tackling dangerous climate change is the biggest challenge facing us all. Fortunately there is an answer to this challenge. Our report: ‘Energy [R]evolution’, details how to halve global CO2 emissions by 2050, using existing technology and still providing affordable energy and economic growth. In short - a revolution in energy policy and an evolution in how we use energy.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Developing countries like China can develop and grow using renewable energy to avoid the mistakes of old climate-changing energy economies of developed countries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate about climate change is over. Solutions are needed now. The Energy [R]evolution is the road map for how to provide power foreveryone without fuelling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't need to freeze in the dark. We don't need to build nuclear power plants. We don't need to cripple economic growth. We can make asafe and sustainable world energy scenario a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Doomsday Clock Ticks Closer to Midnight</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/5-minutes-190107/</url><text>
	The spectre of a nuclear war 60 years ago was what created the "doomsday clock," the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'(BAS) cold war chronometer. The closer the clock to midnight, the closer the world was creeping toward disaster. These days, the superpower polarisation of the world may be gone, but the threat of nuclear conflict remains. And added to that, a new doomsday force is moving the clock hands: global warming.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The 'Doomsday Clock' is now at 5 minutes to midnight.  (Image: Bulletin of Atomic Scientists) 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the six decades of existence, the clock has swung backwards
andforwards between 17 minutes to midnight and as close as 2
minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witheach new nuclear threat, it ticked closer to twelve. With
each new armsreduction treaty or weapons ban, it moved back from
the brink. Now boththe resurgent threat of nuclear weapons and
climate change have movedthe hands of the clock two minutes closer:
to only 5 minutes away frommidnight, the figurative end of the
world as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Withthe end of the cold war, the clock was at an historic 17
minutes awayfrom midnight in 1991. But since then is has moved
steadily closer tomidnight with new nuclear threats and now with
the addition of climatechange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New nuclear threats are sending the clock back towardsthe dark
days of the nuclear standoff between the US and USSR. Theseinclude
the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/north-korea-nuclear-test-091006/"&gt;
nuclear test&lt;/a&gt; which made North Korea an official member of the
nuclear weapons club and the incorporation of nuclear weapons into
&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/don-t-nuke-iran/"&gt;
strategic military planning&lt;/a&gt; for a possible US strike against
Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Asscientists, we understand the dangers of nuclear weapons and
theirdevastating effects, and we are learning how human activities
andtechnologies are affecting climate systems in ways that may
foreverchange life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As citizens of the world, we have a duty to alertthe public to
the unnecessary risks that we live with every day, and tothe perils
we foresee if governments and societies do not take actionnow to
render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further
climatechange."&lt;/p&gt;

Hawking, a BAS sponsor, professor of mathematics at the University
of Cambridge, and a fellow of The Royal Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addedto the increase in nuclear tensions is the acknowledgment
that climatechange now represents a new threat that must be faced
with the samedetermination as ending the possibility of nuclear
war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"TheDoomsday Clock can go backwards as well as forwards and a
massiveuptake of renewable energy sources along with energy
efficiency andconservation would help us tackle both the climate
threat and thethreat of spreading dangerous nuclear technology
around the world",said Steve Sawyer, Greenpeace climate
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce thethreat of nuclear war requires all governments of
the world to listento their citizens who overwhelmingly reject the
use of nuclear weapons.As the world warms and severe weather
becomes more frequent across manyparts of the world, the solutions
to climate change are within thereach of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein said that with the splitting ofthe atom everything
changed except the way we think: the challenge nowis to change the
way we act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;The 12 steps you can take to stop climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Twenty-four Greenpeace activists from Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK were arrested this morning after staging a protest at NATO’s Brussels Headquarters. Their demand: removal of the 480 US-owned and controlled nuclear weapons from Europe. The action occurred as NATO Defence Ministers are preparing for a high-level meeting on the future of NATO.

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen years after the end of the cold war, 480 US Nuclear
weaponsremain in Europe. They are currently stationed in Germany,
Belgium, Italy,the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK. Each of these
nuclear weapons has adestructive capacity of up to ten times that
of the bomb whichdestroyed Hiroshima, and have a combined power
capable of wiping Europeoff the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week a report released by the Commission on Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMDC) chaired by Hans Blix called for the 480 US-owned
and controlled nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe and
returned to US soil. The &lt;a href="http://www.wmdcommission.org/sida.asp?id=1"&gt;WMDC report&lt;/a&gt;
provides great detail on the dangers of US nuclear weapons. The
Commission also explains how these weapons impede international
efforts to negotiate further nuclear reductions with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments of NATO countries have a direct role in shaping
NATO policy and can insist that these weapons be removed from their
territory. The US has taken their weapons home several times
before: Canada, Greece, Denmark (Greenland) and Iceland are all now
free of US nuclear bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we released opinion polls showing that 70 percent of
Europeansliving in those countries which host US nuclear weapons
want to live ina nuclear-weapons-free Europe. The polling data also
demonstrated thata  solid majority of Europeans -- 65.5 percent --
in the six countries whichhost US nuclear weapons are unaware of
their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With all the debate over Iran's nuclear intentions, countries
must accept their own responsibility for escalating nuclear
tensions in the Middle East. By removing US NATO nuclear weapons
European leaders have the opportunity to begin to address the
concerns of their citizens, to strengthen the position of Europe in
negotiations with the Middle East and Russia and take a real step
towards achieving a nuclear weapons free more peaceful future"
concluded Mattfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/nuclear/disarmament/us-nuclear-warplans-against-ir?MM_URL=NATOactionFromMinister"&gt;Tell NATO to say "NO" to US Nuclear weapons in Europe.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=SUMinsisterNukestory"&gt;We don't accept donations from corporations or governments, so we can name and shame and bring you stories like these without being compromised.

	The international body charged by the UN with protecting the whales is about to be taken over by the world's most consistently and aggressively pro-whaling government.  How could this happen?  In an environmentally aware world, why are we seeing a roll back of 20 years of progress on such a fundamental issue?  The answer lies is in a tangle of politics, economics and international bureaucracy, and reveals there might be hope for the future of the whales after all.
&lt;div&gt;

            Humpback whale and calf 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The reality of vote buying&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason behind this reversal is the Japanese
government'sdetermined, and expensive, vote buying program.  Japan
has one ofthe world's largest economies (third globally by
purchasing power), andit is no secret Japan leverages foreign aid
for political gain. As reported recently in the &lt;a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/06/02/2003311320"&gt;
Taipei Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year it [Japan] pledgedmore than US$1 million to
the Pacific island of Tuvalu, a pro-whalingIWC member, and has
reached similar deals with Nauru and Kiribati andother desperately
poor countries in the Pacific. Last week it isbelieved to have
offered a large aid package to other Pacificcountries. It has also
invited the heads of state of seven Africancountries and eight
Caribbean and Central American countries to visitTokyo in the last
year. All are expected to vote with Japan at St Kitts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least US$300 million was given last year to Antigua,
Dominica,Grenada, Panama, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines,
and St Kittsand Nevis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Friday, Jun 02, 2006)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's whalers are so certain their control of the IWC is
assured,last whaling season they increased their self allotted
Antarctic quotato a maximum of 945 whales - including 10 endangered
fin whales (secondin size only to blue whales).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2007/8 it goes higher as they up the number of fin to 50,
andadd another 50 endangered humpbacks on top of that.  The
whalersalready catch so many whales there isn't room on their
factory ship forall the meat, and a refrigerated cargo ship is sent
to the Antarctic totake boxes of whale meat back to Japan.  Even
still, they dumptons of whale overboard - taking home only the more
profitablecuts.  After all, why not?  Who is there to tell
themotherwise?  Up till now, the IWC has regularly condemned
Japan'sso called "scientific" whaling, but with the whaler's in
control itwill more likely pat them on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Governments stand up to whaling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the governments that helped enact the Southern Ocean
WhaleSanctuary (1994) and moratorium on commercial whaling (1986)
have, infact, tried to protect these gains. This past year 17
nations(including Brazil, Australia and the UK) issued a strongly
wordeddiplomatic demarche pointing out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Japan is now killing more whales inthe Antarctic every year
than it killed for scientific research in the31 years prior to the
introduction of the moratorium on commercialwhaling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments further expressed "grave concerns" that the
ongoinghunt, "will undermine the long-term viability," of both fin
andhumpback whales.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it looks like this strong diplomatic action, and ministerial
levelvisits to some new IWC members, will not be enough to keep
Japan fromtaking over.  The reality is that the Japanese government
haschosen to spend more money and political capital on whaling
thangovernments in favour of protecting the whales.  There is on
somelevels probably a disbelief that the whalers can win back
control ofthe IWC - intuitively it just doesn't make sense
considering the messthey made of it before sanity prevailed in the
early eighties. But for years now the warning signs have been
clear.  No matterwhat happens at this year's meeting, it should be
a wake up call forthe conservation minded governments of the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;So who is there left to stop whaling?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly the people reading these words.  From here on it's
largelydown to us.  And around the world individuals are banding
togetherin common cause to defend the whales.  During the last
whalingseason we took on Nissui - one of the world's largest
seafood companiesand also a one-third shareholder in Kyodo Senpaku,
which owns andoperates the whaling fleet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the planet, Nissui subsidiaries heard from angry
shoppers. Organizations like the Humane Society and Environmental
InvestigationsAgency joined in. Greenpeace Ocean Defenders sent a
total of 100,000emails to Nissui-related companies. And Nissui lost
seafood supplycontracts in Argentina after Ocean Defenders placed
stickers denouncingwhaling on Nissui products in supermarkets and
sent more than 20,000emails.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the whaling season was over, Nissui had decided to get
out ofthe whaling industry because, as reported in the Nikkan Kugyo
Shimbun(Daily Industry):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overseas subsidiaries are having bigproblems. As our business
has globalized, whaling has become a hiddenrisk", said Mr. Naoya
Itagaki, the president of Nissui which takes thebrunt of the
criticisms against its involvement in whaling because oftheir share
holding position in Kyodo-Senpaku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(June 8th 2006, morning edition, Greenpeace translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Nissui's move was simply good business sense. 
Asidefrom international pressure, demand for whale meat has
plummeted, evenin Japan.  Stockpiles of whale meat there have
nearly doubled overthe last decade to 5,000 tonnes.  There's so
much unwanted whalemeat that it's being sold as doggie treats, and
an expanded schoollunch program is in the works - with the hope of
getting Japanese kidsused to eating it.  The whaling industry in
Norway is experiencingsimilar difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would Japan's take over of the International Whaling Commission
be adisastrous setback for the whales?  Yes.  But would it be
theend of the story?  We will see about that.&lt;/p&gt;

	The good news is the polar bear is likely to given extra protection under US law. The bad news is its home is disappearing faster than ever. With 2007 predicted to be the warmest year on record it looks like they'll need all the protection they can get.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar bear on iceflow.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2006 the US Fish and Wildlife Service officially
listed the polar bear as a 'threatened' species, due to the
meltdown of its sea-ice habitat caused by global warming.
Unfortunately it took a lawsuit by Greenpeace and the Natural
Resource Defense Council (NRDC) to force the US administration to
put the polar bear on the list and even now its listing is a
proposal so could take another year to be made official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the implications of the listing go far beyond just the polar
bear. Listing under the Endangered Species Act will provide broad
protection to polar bears, including a requirement that US federal
agencies ensure that any action carried out, authorised, or funded
by the US government will not jeopardise the continued existence of
polar bears, or adversely modify their critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The United States has failed to lead the world in tackling
global warming. With under five percent of the world's people, we
generate more than 20 percent of the global warming pollution,"
said Kert Davies, Greenpeace research director. "We must start
cutting greenhouse gas emissions or the Polar Bear will be pushed
to the brink of extinction within our lifetime."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the policy news for the polar bear was good, news from the
Arctic was distinctly bad. What used to be the Ayles Ice Shelf has
broken off from Ellesmere Island, Canada. The shelf was the size of
Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on
the sea ice. A growing body of evidence shows that the Arctic ice
is vanishing much faster than previously expected. The thick
multiyear ice has been shrinking eight to 10 percent per decade,
with some climate models predicting that the Arctic could be
ice-free in summer as early as 2040. In some polar regions, the sea
ice season has shortened as much as three weeks, and scientists
have discovered that the polar ice caps are melting at an alarming
rate - losing an area the size of Colorado - more than a million
square miles - in just the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear and the melting of the Arctic are probably the
most charismatic and dramatic indicators of our changing climate.
It's going to take a lot more than the Endangered Species Act to
save the polar bear and stop dangerous global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the talk about taking action to tackle global warming
increased in 2006, there was still too much talk and too little
action from world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carbon up, temperature up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide emissions, the biggest cause of global warming,
are now rising at more than 2 percent a year. The longer measures
to reduce carbon emissions are postponed the more drastic those
measures will need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As surely as carbon emissions are rising so are global
temperatures. It has already been predicted by the UK Met Office
that 2007 is likely to be one of the warmest years on record. This
is partly due to El Nino and also due to increasing carbon
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's needed in 2007 is action -- from governments,
corporations, but from all of us as well -- to cut carbon emissions
and slow rising temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you leave a light burning unnecessarily, think about
the polar bears.  The next time you buy a product, look at its
energy efficiency and think about the polar bears. And next time a
politician isn't crystal clear that the planet has a problem that
needs fixing, vote with your paw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/"&gt;Give the polar bears a helping hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	True to form, Asia's biggest logging company, Rimbunan Hijau (RH), intimidated and detained six of our activists who attempted to present them with a ‘Golden Chainsaw’ award for forest destruction.

            Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Sam Moko talks to Rimbunan Hijau security guards while attempting to deliver Rimbunan Hijau with the Golden Chainsaw Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists were harassed inside RH's Port Moresby compound
and hadto lock themselves into their vehicles for their own
safety.  Acameraman was assaulted while attempts were made to seize
his film andhis camera was broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RH is the largest logging company in PNG today. A 2003/2004
review ofexisting logging concessions documented numerous
allegations of abuseof local landowners, including rape and
physical violence, by eitherlogging company officials or police
associated with the loggingcompanies. Allegations were also made by
a former officer of an elitePNG police taskforce that RH paid local
police officers to intimidateand beat landowners who complained
about breaches to their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, our personnel and people from the media were prevented
fromleaving the compound for 45 minutes.  The cars and windows
werepounded on and verbal threats made.  The situation came to an
endafter police arrived and escorted Greenpeace staff and
volunteers,along with senior management from RH, to the local
policestation.  No charges were laid.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to peacefully present the company with the award - to
mark 30years of forest destruction - and leave. RH's over-reaction
reflectsits belief that it is above the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred as delegates from around the world arrived
inPort Moresby for the African, Caribbean and Pacific - European
Union(ACP-EU) ministerial meeting to discuss trade and development.
We willbe asking EU delegates to urgently implement legislation to
stopillegal timber from companies like RH from entering the
Europeanmarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RH controls logging concessions in many parts of the developing
world.It operates with impunity in PNG, directly controlling 40 per
cent ofall log exports. It was recently granted a new 791,000
hectareconcession in Kamula Dosa by the PNG government. This
concession islocated in one of the largest pristine forest areas
left in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Golden Chainsaw award is reserved for the worst
forestdestroyers in the world.  It has been awarded twice before,
tocompanies in Brazil and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the award, we released a "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/RH-30years-forest-plunder"&gt;
Forest Crime File&lt;/a&gt;"highlighting RH's continued involvement in
large scale forestdestruction and questioning the legality of its
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report states that unless brought under control, timber
giants suchas RH will continue to "plunder the world's ancient
forests, destroyingcultural diversity, biodiversity, stealing from
some of the world'spoorest and most vulnerable people and degrading
the environment onwhich we ultimately depend".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also points to the close ties RH enjoys with the PNG
government.  Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ex-Deputy Prime Minister was criticised by the PNG
Ombudsmanfor pressuring the National Forest board to favour RH with
an illegaltimber permit extension.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In 2004, Minister for Internal Security, Mark Maipakai was
theshareholder and director of a company, Gopera Investments Ltd,
holdinga timber permit sub-contracted to RH.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A National Intelligence Organisation report alleged that
aprovincial Governor and two Members of Parliament were on
RH'spayroll. &lt;/li&gt;

	Acer and Lenovo are the latest of the top computer makers to commit to stop using the worst toxic chemicals in their products. Along with Motorola these companies are the biggest movers in the latest version of our Guide to Greener Electronics. Disappointingly for Mac fans, Apple has dropped to last place.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Boy recycling electronic waste by hand in India. Companies with good scores in the ranking are part of the solution to the growing e-waste problem. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first released our  'Guide to Greener Electronics' in
August2006. The guide ranks the 14 top manufacturers of personal
computersand mobile phones according to their policies on toxic
chemicals andrecycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thepublic ranking has been successful in spurring many companies
toimprove, and the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/green-guide-to-electronics-se/"&gt;
second edition&lt;/a&gt;, released today, shows good overall industry
progress and some major individual improvements in rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are witnessing a global shift towards greener PCs, with Acer
andLenovo, two major producers, committing to eliminate the use
ofthe most hazardous chemicals from their products range," said
IzaKruszewska, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner, "Most
companiesnow score above average points on the ranking guide, with
only fivecompanies failing to score even the average of five
points."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Full Ranking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/copy-of-how-the-companies-line"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/12/ranking-guide-dec.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranking is important because the amounts of toxic e-waste
isgrowing every day. It often ends up dumped in the developing
world.Reducing the toxic chemicals in products reduces pollution
from oldproducts and makes recycling safer, easier and cheaper.
Companies withgood recycling schemes help ensure that their
products don't end up inthe e-waste yards of Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

Click here to see the full ranking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Green Movers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia continues to hold the top spot in the ranking, with
progressivepolicies on both its chemicals policy as well as
disposal ofelectronic waste. However, the company is yet to outline
cleartimelines for phasing out the toxic plastic PVC (vinyl) in all
itsproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola has been the fastest mover in the ranking guide. From
secondworst in the first version of the guide, it has made strong
commitmentsto moved up to fourth place. Lenovo has also made strong
policycommitments, to jump from the bottom to 8th place.
Fujitsu-Siemens andAcer made substantial progress and are now
ranked 3rd and 7threspectively, moving up from their earlier 10th
and 12th positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Must do better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has made no improvements in its policies and is now bottom
of theranking. While its arch rivals make progress, the world
leader ininnovation and design is falling further and further
behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'd expect an innovative company which takes pride in
'thinkingdifferent' to be top of the ranking - which was why we
launched the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple"&gt;Green
myApple campaign&lt;/a&gt;which has mobilized Mac fans worldwide to tell
Apple how much they lovetheir products: and how badly they want
them to be environmentallysound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGE, Samsug and Sony have lost points for failing to act on
theircommitments to take responsibility for their waste; instead,
thecompanies are supporting regulation in the US that would place
theresponsibility for product recycling on consumers instead of
producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2006, HP had one point deducted from its overall
scorewhen analysis of an HP laptop revealed the presence of a type
of toxicchemical that HP claimed it no longer used. HP was quick to
respond andinvestigate. They went public with an explanation on
their website, andthe penalty point was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By turning the public spotlight on top electronics companies
andchallenging them to outrank their competition, the guide has
succeededin motivating many companies to improve their policies on
chemicals andwaste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butultimately, companies only respond to issues that matter to
theircustomers.  If you're a Mac or iPod user, join the growing
ranksof Apple users &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/mact.html"&gt;telling Steve Jobs
that the back of the pack is just no place for Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            The iconic Apple store on 5th Avenue in New York is bathed in green light to highlight that Apple should go green.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Apple products still &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/itox.html"&gt;contain toxic
chemicals&lt;/a&gt; and itdoesn't have a global recycling policy. While
other competitors likeDell and HP have cleaned up their act Apple
has been playing theenvironmental scrooge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there's no place like New York to light up the night with
aholiday wish. More than 60 activists took to the streets of New
York toturn Apple's iconic 5th Avenue store green, while thousands
of busyholiday shoppers looked on. Our holiday wish list is simple.
All wewant from Steve Jobs is a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/about.html"&gt;green
Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25485/apple-store-green2.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shine a green spotlight on Apple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know a force thatApple listens to, and which can make Apple
adopt clean productionpolicies and improve its recycling
programmes. It's Apple's customers.Apple listens to the people who
buy their product: it's one of thethings we all love about them.

	It's official. The European Union Commission has admitted that we were right about illegal timber in the commission's own headquarters.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            She doesn't work for the EU. So why is her forest home in one of its buildings?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-and-a-half years ago, we roped off the European Commission's star-shaped Berlaymont building as a "Forest Crime Scene." We had discovered that timber stolen from the forest homes of orang-utans was being used in the construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contravened Commission rules that the wood be sourced from well-managed forests, such as those certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, a spokesman for the commission, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1214471,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;quoted in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, rejected the charge of double standards, saying the commission had been assured that only environmentally sound wood would be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Commission Vice-President Kallas has confirmed to us that uncertified plywood was used to renovate the 13th floor, where Commission President Barroso's own office is located.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The plywood was used despite the fact that the Commission required the contractor to use only certified timber," said Sebastien Risso of Greenpeace European Unit. "This story illustrates the extent to which the European market is saturated with illegal and unsustainable timber."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Offices for EU officials or homes for orang-utans?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forests of Indonesia, home of the orang-utan, are under threat from illegal and destructive logging, and land clearance. At the time of the Berlaymont works, up to 80 percent of logging in Indonesia was estimated to be illegal. Huge volumes of timber were being smuggled into Malaysia and China, where they were processed into wood products for export to consumer markets including Europe. Law enforcement by the Indonesian government has clamped down on illegal logging since 2005, but the situation remains fragile, and illegal and destructive activities are far from eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspart of its own programme to tackle illegal logging and its related trade, the European Commission has said that it will launch a public consultation on legislative options to combat the problem. This was promised in 2004 and has been repeatedly delayed since. So far, the Commission has limited its plans to setting up &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.eu/downloads/forests/LawlessNov06.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;voluntary partnership agreements&lt;/a&gt; with timber-producing countries. Greenpeace, together with over 16 NGOs and over 80 companies, has called for additional legislation to tackle illegal timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Pirate DVDs? No way. Last tree from the rainforest? OK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, it's easier to get illegal timber into the EU than it is to bring in pirated music or movies. We think that's an example of misplaced priorities, when the law is better at protecting the pocketbooks of entertainment executives than it is at protecting the last remaining habitats of nearly extinct species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offending contractors in this case were, it's only fair to say, fined. But the sum probably won't discourage further infractions. It was a tiny 750 Euros (US$ 993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the European Commission wants to show that it is serious about preventing forest ecosystem breakdown, it must put forward legislation to ensure that all timber products on the European market come from legal sources and responsibly managed forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has to create an environment in which their own contractors can't flaunt the regulations right under their noses. &lt;/p&gt;

	Scientific tests, arranged by Greenpeace, reveal that Apple's iPhone contains hazardous chemicals. The tests uncovered two types of hazardous substances, some of which have already been eliminated by other mobile phone makers.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, due to our successful &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;
Green my Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; Steve Jobs, the boss of Apple, claimed:
"Apple is ahead of, or will soon be ahead of, most of its
competitors" on environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched closely when the iPhone was launched in June for any
mention of the green features of the phone from Apple. There was
none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we bought a new iPhone in June and sent it our Research
Laboratories in the UK. Analysis revealed that the iPhone contains
toxic brominated compounds (indicating the prescence of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#bfr"&gt;
brominated flame retardants&lt;/a&gt; (BFRs)) and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#pvc"&gt;
hazardous PVC&lt;/a&gt;. The findings are detailed in the report, "&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25275/iPhones-hazardous-chemicals.pdf"&gt;
Missed call: the iPhone's hazardous chemicals&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been thousands of media articles about the iPhone.
Few of them have discussed the phone's environmental credentials.
Check out our video of the disassembly of the iPhone and what the
tests revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent scientific laboratory tested 18 internal and
external components of the iPhone and confirmed the presence of
brominated compounds in half the samples, including in the phone's
antenna, in which they made up 10 percent of the total weight of
the flexible circuit board. A mixture of toxic phthalates was found
to make up 1.5 percent of the plastic (PVC) coating of the
headphone cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Steve Jobs has missed the call on making the iPhone his first
step towards greening Apple's products," said Zeina Alhajj,
Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "It seems that Apple is
far from leading the way for a green electronics industry as
competitors, like Nokia, already sell mobile phones free of
PVC".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Santillo, Senior Scientist at the Greenpeace Research
Laboratories, commented, "Two of the phthalate plasticisers found
at high levels in the headphone cable are classified in Europe as
'toxic to reproduction, category 2' because of their
long-recognised ability to interfere with sexual development in
mammals. While they are not prohibited in mobile phones, these
phthalates are banned from use in all toys or childcare articles
sold in Europe. Apple should eliminate the use of these chemicals
from its products range."&lt;/p&gt;

	Good news: the world's first and second largest exporters of rice have agreed to shun genetically engineered (GE) varieties. A recent agreement between rice traders from Thailand and Vietnam protects half the crop traded on the world market from the dangers of GE, and will put mounting pressure on other rice-producing nations to commit to a GE-free rice supply.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/11/ge-rice-threatens-biodiversity.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/11/ge-rice-threatens-biodiversity.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rice is life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our campaigner Jeremy Tager, the decision resulted
from a  "massive backlash against the GE industry following recent
scandals." Illegal and unapproved GE rice varieties from the US and
China have contaminated the global rice supply, with disastrous
results for many growers, distributors, and traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a historic meeting between the powerful Rice
Exporters Association of Thailand and the Vietnam Food Association
resulted in the joint announcement of a non-GE rice production
policy. More than 30 of the largest rice producers and traders in
Thailand and Vietnam were present to endorse the agreement. Only
days earlier in India (the world's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;third&lt;/span&gt; largest
exporterof rice), the representative body for India's rice
exportersannounced they too were supporting a ban on GE rice field
trials because of the threat they pose to their GE-free export
markets.  The Indian government has yet to take action to ban field
trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand has shown the world that it can lead in rice production
without GE rice. As a key agricultural producer, Thailand stands to
benefit more if it stops all open-field GE crop trials and declares
a GE-free policy once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p style=""&gt;Rice production accounts for11 percent of the world's
arable land, or 500 million hectares, 90percent of which is
produced on Asian farms of less than onehectare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;We are eating the GE industry's experiments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping field trials is important because the results of GE
rice experiments don't seem to be containable: they keep turning up
where they're not welcome. Even as news of the Thailand Vietnam
accord was breaking, we uncovered yet another major contamination,
this time in the Philippines, where rice is the staple food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer's LL601 has contaminated rice products coming from the US,
which are currently on sale in Manila. So far in 2006, this
unapproved and illegal variety has been found in at least 24
countries. Last week contamination was announced in several
countries in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer ended field trials of the LL601 variety in the US five
years ago. The global food industry is now facing massive costs
associated with GE contamination, including testing costs, product
recalls, brand damage, import bans and cancelled imports and
contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least five multi-million dollar class-action lawsuits have
been filed by about 300 US rice farmers against Bayer, as they
struggle to protect their livelihoods from GE contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice has been part of our staple diet around the world for over
10,000 years, it is cultivated in 113 countries - in China alone
there are 75,000 varieties. Studies of the potential ecological
risks of GE rice show that there is a high risk of 'transgene
escape' (gene flow) from GE rice to non-GE rice varieties. Research
also shows that GE rice out-crossing may threaten wild rice
varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Importers are banning it too&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest rice processing company, Ebro Puleva  has
stopped all imports of rice from the US and is expected to bring
legal action against Bayer as well. Ebro Puleva controls 30 percent
of the EU rice market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move is only one of dozens by traders, millers, exporters,
producers and retailers to protect themselves and their customers
from unwanted GE foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that
is grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people access to safe and nutritious
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted technology
that contaminates the environment, threatens biodiversity and poses
unacceptable risks to health.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Hazardous substances reduced but not eliminated from laptops</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hazardous-substances-laptops/</url><text>
	Our investigation into hazardous materials in laptops shows that manufacturers have phased out use of some of the most toxic materials over the past year but still have a long way to go in eliminating others, such as PVC, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and phthalates.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/laptop-motherboard-toxic-test.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/laptop-motherboard-toxic-test.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Motherboard of a laptop during testing for hazardous substances.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We purchased 18 laptops from Acer, Apple, Dell, HP, Sony and
Toshiba in 14 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia and sent
them for analysis by an independent laboratory and at our Exeter
Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, "Toxic chemicals in computers - Reloaded", show
bromine being present in over 40 percent of the components tested,
at concentrations of up to 10 percent by weight. Of the components
tested, Sony laptops were found to have the lowest number
containing bromine, Dell laptops had the highest number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PVC was found in 44 percent of all plastic coating internal
wires and external cables that were tested. Phthalates were found
in the power cables supplied with all laptops, with the highest
levels in those of Acer and HP laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new report follows up our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toxic-chemicals-in-computers/"&gt;
investigation into toxics in laptops&lt;/a&gt; sold in Europe in 2006,
before EU legislation on hazardous substances in electronic
equipment, known as RoHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the implementation of RoHS, computer manufacturers have
significantly reduced their use of lead, cadmium, mercury,
hexavalent chromium and certain brominated flame retardants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is these changes have been implemented by all
companies and not only for the European market where it is a
minimum legal requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows that, for almost every component found to
contain either bromine or plastic PVC, an equivalent component free
of these chemicals can be found in another laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First computer free of the worst toxic chemicals?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, by combining components from different machines, the
industry could already almost produce the first computer free of
the worst toxic chemicals. The question is, which company is going
to be the first to go the whole way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/greencomputerchallenge?MM_URL=laptoptestreport" class="act"&gt;Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While levels of certain toxic chemicals in the laptop
components tested do not exceed current European standards, other
hazardous chemicals found in laptops are not yet covered by
European regulations," said Zeina Alhajj, Greenpeace International
toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace's goal is for computer manufacturers to eliminate
the use of toxic materials completely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The results demonstrate that legislation in one region can have
an influence even in countries where it does not yet apply.
However, even where they do exist, current laws fail to regulate
all hazardous chemicals in laptops, or in other electrical
equipment, "said Dr. Kevin Brigden from the Greenpeace Research
Laboratories who oversaw the sampling analyses and produced the
report. "Laws which aim to protect human health and the environment
must ultimately address all hazardous substances," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who's making the most progress?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working since 2004 to push all the computer
companies mentioned in the report to eliminate the worst toxic
chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have all published plans to drop these chemicals in 2008/9
(with the exception of HP) from all their products. These plans
form part of the companies' scores in our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ranking guide also scores companies on whether they have
already computer models free of PVC and BFRs on the market. Based
on this criterion, out of the computer companies whose laptops we
tested, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-so-5/"&gt;
Sony&lt;/a&gt; scores highest followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-to-5/"&gt;
Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of this test, it seems Sony is closest to the goal
of eliminating toxic chemicals from computers. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-ap-5/"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt; is making progress since the last test but &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-de-5/"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-hp-5/"&gt;
HP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-ac-5/"&gt;
Acer&lt;/a&gt; still have the most work to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/greencomputerchallenge?MM_URL=laptoptestreport"&gt;You can keep the pressure up by writing to the CEO's of the top computer firms to challenge them to produce a greener computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=laptopdonate"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite.

	Nicolas Sarkozy, France's President,  yesterday called for an environmental "revolution".  Among other measures, he promised to outlaw energy wasting lightbulbs by 2010, ban commercial growing of genetically modified food and feed crops, and use the precautionary principle for all future government decisions.  If yesterday's words become laws, and those laws become deeds, it could be the spark that changes the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-12.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hang a 12 by 3 metre banner reading “Ban GMO’s NOW” on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris urging the French government to ban genetically modified organisms. The government is expected to decide in the next few days on the future regulation of genetically modified, or genetically engineered, crops. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Genetically engineered crop ban&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France - the EU's biggest agricultural producer - is the sixth
government in Europe to ban genetic engineered crops. (Austria,
Germany, Greece, Hungary and Poland are the other five.) The only
genetically engineered crop currently grown in France is Monsanto's
genetically engineered maize (MON810).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not clear if what was announced is a permanent ban, or a
temporary measure.  Sarkozy did cite three good reasons to avoid
growing genetically engineered crops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doubts about their usefulness.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Doubts about their benefits for health and the
environment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Concerns about their uncontrolled dissemination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're calling on other governments inside and outside of Europe
to follow this positive example," said Greenpeace campaigner Geert
Ritsema. "And to put the interest of citizens and the environment
before the interests of a handful of multinational corporations
such as Monsanto, Bayer, and BASF that produce and sell genetically
engineered crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Saving energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightbulb manufactures themselves are calling for an end to
energy wasting lightbulbs in Europe by 2019.  Sarkozy scores
considerably better with his target of 2010.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compact fluorescent lightbulbs use one-fifth the energy of
traditional incandescents lightbulbs.  Switching to energy saving
bulbs in the EU alone, would save 20 million tonnes of CO2, equal
to shutting down 25 medium-size dirty power plants.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sharon Becker said, "We hope that this
measure will open the eyes of other EU countries and that the
energy efficiency standards needed to ban these bulbs, will pave
the way for a broader spectrum of standards, for example for
electronics and appliances."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarkozy also called for more use of train transport, and better
fuel efficiency for cars.  Following through on the promise of cars
which emit on average 120 gram of CO2 per kilometre by 2012 would
have a knock-on effect globally by fully commercializing existing
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Nuclear - lack of progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Sarkozy gushed about renewable energy, it's clear
France is not quite ready to give up its nuclear addiction.  France
has 59 operating nuclear reactors, and is building a new one based
on what is called the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) design.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is also marketing its nuclear technology to countries
like the UK, US, China, Canada, Brazil and Morocco.  Already there
is an EPR nuclear plant under construction in Finland - years
behind schedule, over a billion euros over budget and plagued by
more than 1,000 documented quality problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good that Sarkozy agreed to phase out energy wasting
bulbs," said Greenpeace campaigner Jan Beranek.  "But by saying A
he should also say B, which is that thanks to plans for improved
efficiency, there is no need for additional reactors in
France."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Sustainability first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on in France, the burden of proof must be placed on
ecologically destructive activities, according to Sarkozy.  Rather
than environmentalists having to show that there's a better way,
companies and people proposing ecologically destructive decisions
need to prove there is no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important idea put forward by
Sarkozy.  It's very similar to the precautionary principle
championed by Greenpeace and other environmental groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precautionary principle is a moral and political principle
which states that if an action or policy might cause severe or
irreversible harm to the public, in the absence of a scientific
consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on
those who would advocate taking the action.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the precautionary principle is the route to
sustainable economies and a healthy planet for future generations. 
Applying it thoroughly would be a true revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 steps - join&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=sarkozy"&gt;Join the revolution by taking your own 7 steps.

	The corporate braumeisters of Anheuser-Busch have let genetically engineered rice contaminate their Budweiser beer, independent laboratory testing has revealed. Tests show rice used in Anheuser-Busch's east coast US breweries is contaminated with genetically engineered rice varieties outlawed in most of the world.

            Budweiser beer made with genetically engineered rice. True.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budweiser is an international brand exported to 60 countries
worldwide.  Anheuser-Busch controls 50 percent of the US beer
market and is the largest single purchaser of rice in America. They

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="more_story" name="more_story"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The contamination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, over 30 percent of the US long grain rice crop was
contaminated by multiple strains of genetically engineered (GE)
rice. It is still not clear how this happened.  We do know that
these GE rice strains, called "Liberty Link", came from Germany's
Bayer CropScience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot thickened when it was revealed the GE rice that
eventually ended up in Anheuser-Busch's brewing mix was supposed to
be confined to test sites only. This GE rice was never cultivated
or marketed for sale. The US Department of Agriculture
retroactively approved the use of the Liberty Link rice strains,
but their sale is still outlawed in most of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contamination wreaked havoc with US rice farmers and
processors. It is estimated in a class action lawsuit filed against
Bayer that 63 percent of the US rice industry's export trade was
disrupted. Orders and contracts were cancelled, products were
removed from shelves, shipments were halted and recalls ordered.
Testing and certification requirements were imposed. There was
extensive brand damage and a large loss of market share for US
producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Anheuser-Busch's responsibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Anheuser-Busch did not cause the genetic contamination
of the rice, the company has a responsibility to their customers.
It should have refused to purchase or use any rice contaminated by
the GE strains. Tests conducted for Greenpeace show Anheuser-Busch
let the ball drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch has made a commitment to use only GE free
ingredients at its brewery in Wuhan, China, but has to date refused
to make the same commitment to American and European consumers.
Whassup with that?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the makers of Budweiser,
Anheuser-Busch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a global commitment - for itself, its partners and
subsidiaries - that it will be GE free in all its beer
ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;B)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To actively oppose the growing of GE rice including current
fields in Arkansas being cultivated by Bayer CropScience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a letter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/wassup?MM_URL=bud-ge"&gt;Ask wassup?!

<item><language>en</language><title>Indonesia:  Forests and climate up in smoke</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/indonesia-forests-climate/</url><text>
	Never has the threat to the world’s forests been more acute nor the risk of dangerous climate change so imminent. With  about one-fifth of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions being caused by forest destruction we are highlighting how Indonesia is at the heart of this problem.
&lt;div&gt;

            Local children on a wooden raft surrounded by smoke from tropical rainforest on fire in Indonesia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesian forests are being destroyed faster than any other
major forested country, for logging and oil palm plantations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This destruction has obvious, immediate consequences for the
unique plants, animals and people who call the Indonesian forests
home. These forests contain between 10 and 15 percent of all known
species of plants, mammals and birds that make up the world's
treasure chest of biodiversity. Orangutans, elephants, tigers,
rhinoceros, more than 1,500 species of birds and thousands of plant
species are all part of the country's natural legacy. But many of
these unique forest-dwelling animals, including the orangutan and
the Sumatran tiger, are on the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the loss of forests is bad enough, there's a double blow
for the environment from forest clearance in Indonesia. Beneath
most of this forest are thick layers of peat that lock up millions
of tones of carbon. Once the forest is cleared the peat swamp is
drained and often also burned to make the soil more suitable for
palm oil plantations. Burning of the forest and peat results in
huge amounts of greenhouse gases making Indonesia the world's third
largest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter, with up to 75
percent of its emissions coming from land conversion and
deforestation mainly in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;More emissions than transport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally deforestation and forest fires account for
approximately 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's
more emissions than the world's entire transport sector. If global
deforestation is left unchecked it will continue to accelerate the
rate of global warming.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This urgent global problem needs a global solution. We have
launched a Forest Defenders Camp on the boundary of forest clearing
in a region of Sumatra. In the coming weeks we'll be highlighting
scale of the destruction and who's responsible. But also in
Indonesia lies the start of that global solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia will be hosting the next round of international
climate talks in December. Governments from around the world will
gather in Bali to negotiate about extending the Kyoto Protocol, the
only international agreement containing legally-binding limits on
greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to ensure that deforestation is included in the next
phase of the Kyoto agreement extending beyond 2012. The decisions
that governments make in the near future are critical for securing
the financing and capacity needed by countries to safeguard their
tropical forests and to allow them to make a serious contribution
to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stabilising the world's climate depends on countries agreeing to
deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and
industrial sectors and completely halting deforestation. And, above
all, ensuring that this is firmly written into the revised Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the camp&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/working-in-paradise/forest-defenders-camp?MM_URL=indo-for-clim"&gt;Read more about our Forest Defenders Camp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=indo-for-clim"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Tracking whales from space</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tracking-whales-from-space/</url><text>
	Every year humpback whales migrate thousands of kilometres from the warmth of the South Pacific to their feeding grounds in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. It is a journey full of danger, as the whales must now contend with numerous threats along the way. From entanglement in fishing gear to the effects of climate change. And this year, for the first time in 20 years they will arrive in the sanctuary and have to contend with the whalers' harpoons.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/rarotonga-cook-islands-18-se.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Humpback whale swims past the Cook Island whale research boat, enjoying the warm water and the protected reefs of Rarotonga (Cook Islands). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a journey that has until now been a mystery. We know where the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/%20"&gt;whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; breed, in the warm waters of the South Pacific and where the whales feed, in the iceberg filled waters of the Southern Ocean. The journey the whales take between these two distant places however, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery may finally be revealed this year because we are collaborating with scientists from Opération Cétacés in New Caledonia and the Center for Cetacean Research and Conservation (CCRC) in the Cook Islands to find out where the whales go on their epic migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/map/"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/whaletrailmapbanner/2007/10/gwtmapbanner430px.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists at Opération Cétacés and CCRC have placed satellite tags on 20 humpback whales and we are now receiving regular updates from the satellites on the whales locations as they travel along the 'Great Whale Trail'. The satellite data isn't just for the scientists though, you can follow the whales with our interactive google map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map already raises some fascinating questions, for real and amateur scientists alike. The whales from the Cook Islands are heading in a westerly direction, not south as you might expect. Some of the whales are even swimming away from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they are swimming towards a current that sweeps across the Pacific Ocean to the east coast of Australia before turning south. Maybe there is another other ocean feature they are heading for that we don't know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales from New Caledonia are also showing some fascinating behaviour with most of them heading south as expected but fanning out over a huge area, not staying together. One of the New Caledonia whales is heading west to the Australian coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the map of the whales migration and profiles of the whales, you can also sign up for your free 'Whale Mail' which gives regular updates on the whales migration, threats they face along the way and all other whale related action, and you can also be part of a competition to name some of the whales!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By collaborating with Opération Cétacés and CCRC, we are supporting important, non-lethal research into the migration of humpback whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the satellite data with other non-lethal research like biopsy darts (small pieces of skin and blubber that can be DNA analysed) and scientific observation, the final mysteries about the lives of humpback whales can be unravelled without harming the whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research, is in stark contrast to the unnecessary, fake research that the Japanese Fisheries Agency carries out each year by killing around 1,000 whales in the Southern Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After swimming thousands of kilometres to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary the whales should be safe. The whales we are tracking however, could be in the sights of the whalers in just a couple of months time.&lt;/p&gt;

	Eight Greenpeace activists trapped in a Brazilian environmental protection agency (Ibama) office, for nearly two days, have finally managed to escape. Our team was forced to seek refuge in the Ibama Amazon base, after loggers blocked them from transporting a dead Brazil nut tree we had government permission to collect and use. [UPDATED]
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/brazil-bulldozer-tree.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/brazil-bulldozer-tree.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Deforestation is responsible for three quarters of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, and makes the country the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;300 loggers, with eight trucks, ten vans, and 15 motorbikes
surrounded the building. Then, last night, Brazilian police
escorted our team to out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intended to use the Brazil nut tree as part of a public
exhibition exposing Amazon destruction and its contribution to
global warming. The tree was taken from land that had been
illegally cleared and burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 3px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 26 October -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the governor and the mayor of Sao Paulo have joined our
call for zero deforestation in the Amazon.  (&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/10/mayor_and_governor_of_sao_paul.html"&gt;
read more&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Government Sides with Loggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Brazilian government gave in to the loggers,
and revoked Greenpeace's license to remove, transport and exhibit
the valuable and protected Brazil nut tree, now in custody of the
loggers. Despite the government back down, many loggers continued
to surround the building with our activists inside. It was not
until police committed to escort them later that night, that the
Greenpeace team was able to make it to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loggers were undermining basic constitutional rights such as
security and freedom of movement. It is the second time in two
months that Greenpeace has been &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/08/threats_and_intimidation_down.html"&gt;
harassed like this&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;All this fuss over a tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That a mob of 300, many of them involved in illegal
deforestation, was allowed to stop eight activists from collecting
one dead tree shows how out of control the situation is in this
part of Brazil - and how special Brazil nut trees are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1994, the Brazilian nut tree (Bertholettia excelsa) has
been protected by law from burning and logging, but is still
endangered by illegal land clearing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can grow to over 50 metres tall, live for 500 years and are
integral to the rainforest ecosystem.  Brazil nuts grow in canon
ball like clusters about the size of grapefruits, which can reach
deadly speeds as they fall from the canopy.  Its fruit (nuts) are
extremely high in protein - eaten in the region and exported to
countries like the UK, Germany and Italy. The nuts are one of the
main non-timber forests products in the Amazon.  About one million
people depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this one tree is a symbol.  On this, even the illegal
loggers and the activists they blockaded agree.  The loggers have
said they will build a memorial with the tree in the town square.
For us, this is a memorial showing the lack of governance in the
Amazon - that the ones in charge aren't the government or the
people of Brazil, but the loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Brazil: World’s fourth largest climate polluter &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for three quarters of Brazil's
greenhouse gas emissions, and makes the country the fourth largest
climate polluter in the world. Our exhibition using the Brazil nut
tree to highlight this has wide support across the country.
Governors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have already confirmed
their attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil wants to be recognized as a serious player on the
international stage, yet can't even uphold its own constitution in
the Amazon.  Greenpeace is calling for including deforestation in
the post-2012 Kyoto climate regime to be discussed in Bali,
Indonesia this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Marcelo Maquesini, one of the team trapped inside the Ibama
office said, "If Brazil is to be taken seriously by the
international community in negotiations on climate, biodiversity or
human rights, then they need to be able to enforce basic law and
order in the areas where forests are being destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amazon deforestation must end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government should allow us to take the Brazil nut
tree as agreed. Tackling deforestation is an urgent issue, and
people in Brazil (and around the world) have a right to see first
hand the consequences of land clearing in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, in cooperation with nine other groups, two weeks ago
launched a proposal for a national agreement to end Amazon
deforestation at an event attended by the Brazilian Minister of
Environment and State Governors. The proposal seeks a broad
commitment from the Brazilian government and civil society to
create measures protecting the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=amazon-para-trapped"&gt;Sign up for our regular ezine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=amazon-para-trapped"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Since Monday, activists have taken action against the construction site for the Boxberg new coal-fired power plant in eastern Germany. Their demand is simple; the owner company, Vattenfall, must stop building dirty coal plants and instead invest in clean renewable energy technologies.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists climb on seven cranes at the coal power plant building site of Vattenfall in Boxberg. They hang a huge Banner from the crane reading: Vattenfall: Stop building! Climate protection instead of brown coal! Smaller banners at the other cranes read: Stop CO2!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 34 activists camped in cranes on the site, and hung a giant
banner relaying this to Vattenfall, and small banners with the
message "Stop CO2" were hung from six cranes on the site. On ground
level the message was clear "Climate change, powered by
Vattenfall."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Wednesday update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, three days later, 11 activists remained perched on
one of the cranes, while 20 volunteers painted "Stop CO2" onto the
side of the smoke stack under construction. Vattenfall has refused
to meet with Greenpeace to talk about climate change and how the
Boxberg plant will contribute to the global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is number one climate killer, and the coal they are
planning to burn at Boxberg is lignite, or brown coal, the dirtiest
type possible. The emissions from Block R alone, where the blockade
is happening, would discharge 4.4 million tonnes of CO2 a year,
equivalent to the entire CO2 emissions of Costa Rica over the same
time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Germany repeatedly attempts to establish itself as a climate
protection leader on the international stage, yet continues to
build filthy lignite power plants. This makes a mockery of
Germany's climate commitments. The German government and Vattenfall
must immediately stop construction of coal plants, and invest in
renewable energy instead" said Gabriela von Goerne, Greenpeace
Climate and Energy Campaigner, at the Boxberg site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Policy and science reality check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN scientific findings dictate that industrialised countries
must cut their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent by
2050, to keep global mean temperature rise as far below 2°C,
compared to pre-industrial levels, as possible, urgently needed to
prevent climate change from spiralling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, governments across the world continue to invest in coal -
the dirtiest power source in the world. If new coal-fired power
plants, across the world, continue to be built at their current
rate, this outdated technology will account for an enormous 43
percent of global CO2 emissions within 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vattenfall is one of the biggest power companies in Europe,
active in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Poland, Denmark and the
Netherlands. A massive 63 percent of the power they produce in
Germany is generated through brown coal, despite this the company
is aggressively marketing itself there as climate protection
aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What dialogue?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, given their refusal to meet with Greenpeace,
Vattenfall is running a massive advertising campaign in German
newspapers calling for dialogue to build trust in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is exactly what Greenpeace is offering them -
dialogue. Perhaps it's the terms that are scaring them so much.
Greenpeace want to talk about the relationship between coal and
climate change, Vattenfall want to be considered "climate aware"
while investing heavily in brown coal, the largest contributor to
CO2 emissions possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volunteers are heading down from the cranes now, but their
demand for concrete answers from Vattenfall about their climate
change policy remains. The three day continuous presence at the
Boxberg site is just the beginning for this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 3px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 4 October 2007 -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protest is over, fornow.  The activists on the crane stayedthere
for over 60 hours, even through horrendous rain. The protesters
(from Poland, Denmark, Swiss,Czech and Germany) have now left the
site. But our energy revolution continues.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate fishing blacklist</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirate-fishing-blacklist/</url><text>
	Today we launched the world's first global online database of blacklisted, Illegal Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing vessels.  This database will help regulators, port officials, fish buyers, coastal communities and others keep track of pirate fishing vessels. It also exposes how shamefully little official bodies have done to curb pirate fishing on a global scale.
&lt;div&gt;

Chinese fishing boats Lian Run 24 and Lian Run 29 illegally transshipping frozen fish boxes onto Binar 4 Panama reefer. 
Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice Foundation are working in partnership to expose the scandal of pirate fishing, as part of the year - long Greenpeace Defending Our Oceans expedition to highlight a range of threats to the oceans.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we had to publish a global database of &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/"&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; illegal
fishing vessels demonstrates clearly just how little concrete
action states have taken to stop the pillage of our oceans," said
oceans campaigner Sari Tolvanen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern commercial fishing is a global business.  When a ship
gets into legal trouble it can often change its flag state or name,
then show up in another port.  Information sharing using a global
database will help with tracking suspect ships wherever they go. 
Supply vessels, refrigerated cargo ships and the companies and
owners behind them may also be in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database will initially contain information from official
sources; at a later stage it will also become an interactive tool,
where coastal communities and fishers can report information about
irresponsible vessels and their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meeting in Rome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blacklist was launched in Rome today, where a biannual UN
Food and Agriculture Organisation's Fisheries Committee meeting is
taking place. At the meeting, the issues of blacklist databases and
licensed fishing vessels databases is on the agenda once again. We
also brought our new report to the meeting exposing just how little
has been done in the last five years to stop IUU fishing,
particularly in regions like West Africa. Our investigations in
Guinea  last year found that almost half of the 92 fishing vessels
we encountered in Guinea's waters were fishing illegally, or linked
to illegal fishing activities. It has been estimated that
sub-Saharan Africa loses around $1 billion a year due to the
activities of such illegal trawling fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the FAO approved an International Plan of Action
to combat illegal fishing, but little has been done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team at the meeting is passing out bookmarks with &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/"&gt;oceans.greenpeace.org/blacklist&lt;/a&gt;
on one side, and &lt;a href="http://www.fishing-vessel-whitelist.org/"&gt;fishing-vessel-whitelist.org&lt;/a&gt;
on the other.  The whitelist site is actually a spoof, pointing out
that so far states have failed in their responsibility to create
such a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, with only three ships Greenpeace does not have the
capacity to police the world's oceans.  That is the job of
governments.  We're hoping that our database will spur them into
action - including the creation of an official global blacklist of
fishing vessels, along with a whitelist of legitimate/legal fishing
vessels.  In the mean time, we hope countries with widespread
pirate fishing in their waters - particularly developing country
coastal communities - will benefit from our &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/"&gt;blacklist database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Visit the blacklist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Visit the fishing vessel blacklist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The second biggest nuclear disaster in history</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mayak-nuclear-disaster280907/</url><text>
	Everybody knows that the biggest nuclear catastrophe in history was Chernobyl. But how many have heard of the second biggest? Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of a radiation nightmare.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mayaknuclearvictim2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mayaknuclearvictim2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ramzis has hydrocephalus. “I don’t like to go to school, because the boys call me bad names. The girls avoid me and don’t want to go out with me. I hope I will not have children who look like me.” Ramzis lives near Mayak, the site of a former Russian nuclear plant and the most radioactively polluted place on Earth.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayak nuclear plant in the Southern Urals was one of the dark secrets of the cold war. It was the Soviet Union's primary nuclear complex, a massive set of plutonium production reactors, fuel production facilities, and reprocessing and waste storage buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957 a storage tank with highly radioactive liquid waste exploded. More than half the amount of radioactive waste released by the accident in Chernobyl was blasted into the atmosphere. A few villagers were evacuated, but most were not. 217 towns and at least 272,000 people were exposed to chronic levels of radiation. The plume was 50 kilometers wide and 1,000 kilometers long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the explosion wasn't the only incident of contamination. Between 1948 and 1956 radioactive waste was poured straight into the Techa River, the source of drinking water for many villages. It exposed 124,000 people to medium and high levels of radiation. Nuclear waste was also dumped into the lakes of West Siberia, where storms blew nuclear dust across a vast area around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The largest nuclear complex in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, around 7,000 people still live in direct contact with the highly polluted Techa river or on contaminated land. In the town of Muslyumovo, studies have show genetic abnormalities to be 25 times more frequent than in other areas of Russia. The incidents of malignant cancer are significantly higher. And the number of residents of Muslyumovo on the Russian national oncology registers is nearly 4 times higher than in the rest of Russia. In other surrounding towns and villages people have cancer rates more than double the Russian average. (See the Greenpeace Report, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/mayak-a-50-year-tragedy/"&gt; Mayak: A 50-Year Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a century later, Mayak is one of the most radioactive places on Earth, and the accident continues to have a devastating legacy. Many thousands of people have never been evacuated from contaminated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch photo-journalist, Robert Knoth, visited the Mayak region in 2000 and 2001 and took a series of &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/mayak/testimonies/image-gallery.html"&gt; highly disturbing pictures of the victims&lt;/a&gt; of radiation in the region. &lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;(Parental warning: The link above contains images of malformed foetuses and other disturbing photos.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25285/nine-year-old-kostya-victim-o.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, the real tragedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, no government could oversee this kind of disaster and not decide to change its ways. Yet, rather than learning the lessons of the tragedy, the Russian Government has passed legislation to import spent nuclear fuel from other countries to Mayak that would then permanently stay at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the countries shipping their dirty nuclear waste to Russia would allow Mayak to continue operating on their own land. Countries considering sending their radioactive waste to Russia are abdicating responsibility for their nuclear activities by dumping it somewhere else. They may like to think that once it's out of their sight they've got rid of the problem, but nothing could be further from the truth. The people who will suffer its devastating effects are right here, the same victims that have suffered the effects of the radiation disaster for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign fuel processed in Mayak so far has led to some three million cubic metres of radioactive liquid being dumped and released into the environment. Mayak has reprocessed over 1,540 tons of spent nuclear fuel from several countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities now hope to negotiate future reprocessing contracts with Switzerland, Spain, South Korea, Slovenia, Italy, Belgium, and Slovakia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 50 year contamination legacy, Mayak is a horrific example of the true face of the global nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of Mayak is that nuclear energy is not a solution. This anniversary should serve as a wake-up call to the world about the real costs of nuclear power. Nuclear power &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/nuclear_fallacy/"&gt; undermines&lt;/a&gt; the solutions to climate change, by diverting resources away from the massive investment in renewable technologies and energy efficiency the world urgently needs to tackle the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We need your help to keep working for a green and peaceful planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Esperanza heads to Sydney</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/to-sydney/</url><text>
	The Esperanza has shadowed the Japanese whaling fleet, including the crippled mothership Nisshin Maru, out of the Southern Ocean.  Most of the crew are quite relieved to be approaching Sydney considering the terrible weather the last few days.  But even as the voyage comes to an end, our work is far from over...
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Esperanza is on her way to (hopefully sunny) Sydney
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza is heading to Sydney fresh from the Southern
Ocean, to meet and greet Ocean Defenders and our Australian
supporters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;For more information on how you can get on  board, please see &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whaling will never be stopped in the Southern Ocean alone. 
It's only a few months until the International Whaling Commission
(IWC) meets in Anchorage, Alaska. Recently Cyprus announced it was
joining the IWC  - good news for the whales, and Turkey and Poland
have also started procedures to join.  But there is a long way to
go before ensuring that the anti- whaling nations have a definite
majority at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The "normalisation" meeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, the Japanese government held a meeting in Tokyo to
"normalise" the IWC.  &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/iwc-normalisation-meeting-c/"&gt;
As we reported&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed that "normalise" means "continue
business as usual" -- in this case, keep on catching whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, thousands of Ocean Defenders andGreenpeace
cyberactivists asked the Danish government not to go to
the"normalisation" meeting, which intended to pave the way for
resumingcommercial whaling after the next IWC meeting.
Unfortunately, theDanish IWC commissioner Ole Samsing attended the
meeting anyway.  Buton a positive note, what he said there was well
reported to the Danishpublic, the majority of whom don't support
commercial whaling and wantto see an end to it for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;From ocean to office: Denmark and the IWC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Danish commissioner made some statements endorsing a return
of the whaling industry, and suggesting that decisions about
whaling should be made in closed meetings with the press and
non-governmental organizations (like Greenpeace) excluded. Now the
Danish Foreign Affairs Minister is under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The native population of Greenland, which has a special
relationship to Denmark, conducts a traditional "subsistence"
hunt.  However, in our opinion, Greenlandic society has no interest
in the Danish government being still more supportive to the
Japanese government's position on whaling, since the traditional
Greenlandic hunt is very different to the commercial whaling that
the Japanese government is fighting to bring back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Under pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future Denmark's Foreign Affairs Minister has to
explain the Danish IWC position to parliament - a debate that is
desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action/denmark"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To
keep up the pressure we urgently ask you to send an email to the
Danish minister for foreign affairs, Per Stig Moller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action/denmark"&gt;Keep the pressure on Denmark to vote for whales at the next IWC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More you can do (even with Lego!)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Check out whales.greenpeace.org for more campaign ideas, or make your own!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Seven years? It's a tall order but we have a cunning plan. Together with eight other national campaigning organisations, our Brazilian team have launched an ambitious proposal with a goal of zero deforestation by 2015.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-deforestation-agreement/"&gt; The plan&lt;/a&gt;, published yesterday, sets out specific targets that could see deforestation drop gradually over the next seven years, pushing for a cut of 25 percent in the first year compared to figures for 2005/6. It's thinking on a massive scale, but we believe it can be done - with deforestation rates already falling and with a concerted effort it really could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the proposal contains a few key elements, none of which are particularly radical but together with tough reduction targets add up to a powerful package. One is to create financial incentives that promote forest protection rather than forest destruction, so everyone is encouraged to make use of the forest in a truly responsible manner than has been the case up until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another central plank of the proposal is to beef up the forest protection agencies so there is a hugely increased presence of state and government officials. With increased resources, they'll be able to monitor, control and inspect commercial activities properly to prevent illegal logging and land clearance for farming. One of the major challenges is to ensure that zero deforestation is achieved while still guaranteeing the social-rights of indigenous and local communities who live in and around the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is going to be possible without full involvement from the government and companies, but at least they're listening. Present at the launch in Brasilia today were Minister of Environment Marina Silva and the governors of several Amazon states, including Blario Maggi. As well as being governor of Mato Grosso, he is also the head of Grupo Amaggi, a major soya exporter and signatory too the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/mcvictory"&gt;two-year soya moratorium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's a price tag for all this - an estimated one billion reais (over 384 million euros). Weighed against the value of the rain forest in terms of biodiversity and the livelihoods of the people who depend on it, it looks like small change, particularly when it includes international contributions. Because, given the rainforest's role in moderating climate change, it's something we all have an interest in preserving: up to one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions are down to deforestation, making Brazil the fourth largest polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol begin this December in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, and we want to see deforestation included in the discussions. If that happens, responsibility for forest protection won't fall just on forest nations, and rich countries will need to contribute as well. For daring zero deforestation proposals like this one to work, international co-operation is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=amz-agreement"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Behind the spin: bearing witness in the Southern Ocean</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/icr-lies/</url><text>
	22 February - In the last week, the difference between what we see and hear, here in the Ross Sea, and what we read in the news could not have been more stark. We are getting conflicting reports from the whaling fleet and from the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), Mr Glenn Inwood, who is thousands of miles away on land.  Dave and Sara on the Esperanza take a look at the truth and lies of Southern Ocean whaling.

            Sakyo Noda (Japanese Campaigner) and Melanie Duchin (US Campaigner) on the bridge of the MY Esperanza.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The normal whale research program ends around late March, so westill have three to four weeks left and the fleet is going to continuewith the work there&lt;/span&gt;,"
Mr Inwood &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21263102-1702,00.html"&gt;has
been saying&lt;/a&gt;. He even told Radio New Zealand "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;we might even startwhaling again as soon as today&lt;/span&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We" doesn't seem to include the whalers themselves.  Yesterday,
our campaigner Sakyo spoke to the whaling fleet's expedition leader
via radio,and asked him if the fleet were starting whaling again -
the answer was no. He added that therewas still a lot of work to be
done on the ship. They have managed tostart the main engine, but
the winch is broken down - due oilpressure problems - and the ship
has yet to move under her own power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;"Having a laugh"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;It is certainly not in anyone's interest to give any information,or correct information, to Greenpeace. They are not a signatory toanything down there. Maybe the skipper was just having a laugh,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" - Inwood to Radio New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might not be a signatory to anythingdown here, but Japan is
-  to the &lt;a href="http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/antarctic_treaty_summary.htm"&gt;
Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt;.  The Antarctic conditions are nolaughing
matter. Not only has one person lost their life, butwe've got a
drifting whaling factory ship, an environmental threat, anddozens
of crewmen working in the tough conditions of theRoss Sea. It seems
unlikely that thewhaling fleet's expedition leader, who is
currently trying to deal witha broken-down 8,000-ton ship, has
thetime and inclination to make up stories "for a laugh", not to
mention that the captain of the chaser ship the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Yushin Maru &lt;/span&gt;told
Maritime New Zealand &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/22/asia/AS-GEN-Antarctica-Crippled-Whaler.php"&gt;
the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;"Absolutely no threat"?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21263102-1702,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mr Inwood also likes to say&lt;/a&gt; that there is
absolutely no threat to the Antarctic environment from the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;.
Unfortunately, unlike the Esperanza, none of the Japanese whaling
fleet is "iceclass" - meaning they are not are built to deal with
severe seaice conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not recognising a potential "threat" to the pristineAntarctic
environment that could be sparked off by some adverse
weatherconditions leaves Mr Inwood looking a little short on
hisunderstanding of geography, meteorology and physics. There's a
reported 1,000 tons of oil on board the stranded factoryship.  Also
with the fleet is a fuel tanker, the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/span&gt;,
flagged toPanama, that has not filed an Environmental Impact
Assessment inaccordance with the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Environmental Impact Assessments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually,&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the vessels inthe whaling fleet
have submitted environmental impact assessments(EIA). Because the
whaling fleet claims that it is only answerable to theInternational
Whaling Commission, it doesn't follow Antarctic Treatyprocedure. 
One such procedure is the &lt;a href="http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/madrid_protocol.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Madrid Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which subjects &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;
activities taking place in the Treatyarea to prior scrutiny for how
they might affect the environment here - including through fires
like the one on the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is party to both the Antarctic Treaty and theMadrid
Protocol, so it seems strange that the Japanese governmentdoesn't
require its whaling fleet to submit EIAs. Especially considering
that the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not a whaling ship and therefore not even exempt from the
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what we see and hear, and we know what Mr Inwood is
reportedto have said and put out in his own press releases - we
leave you todecide who is bearing witness to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/02/sorry_mr_inwood_could_you.html"&gt;

	The Esperanza is ready to tow the stricken Japanese whaling vessel the Nisshin Maru out of danger and prevent potential Antarctic environmental disaster.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The MY Esperanza in the Southern Ocean.  The Greenpeace vessel is on its way to offer assistance to the Japanese Whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Mauru after it caught fire.  Greenpeace has offered to tow the factory ship out of the Whale Sanctuary and the pristine Antarctic Environment. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the Southern Ocean -
campaigning against illegal whaling - we find ourselves in an
unexpected situation. The vessel we had been searching for - the
Japanese factory whaling ship Nisshin Maru - issued a distress call
after a serious fire broke out on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Esperanza on course&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza is now less than a day's sailing from the disabled
whaling ship. We've made a commitment to the fleet to assist the
crew in any way possible, and make an environmental impact
assessment if needed. One crewmember of the Nisshin Maru is still
missing, and it's reported that the ship could be carrying
approximately 1,000 tons of oil and sitting 100 nautical miles from
the largest Adelie penguin colony in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan has already refused help from
Greenpeace, labelling us "terrorists". However, the Esperanza is
continuing on its course to the stricken vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our first thoughts are for the missing crewman and the rest of
the people on board. This is not a time to play politics from
behind a desk in Tokyo," said Karli Thomas, expedition leader on
board the Esperanza. "This is a human tragedy and a potential
environmental disaster. We have a moral obligation to act and there
is a legal obligation under the Antarctic treaty for the Nisshin
Maru's owners to accept our help." Thomas added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Offer of help&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have offered to tow the whaling factory ship out of the
pristine Antarctic environment of the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary. The Esperanza's captain, Frank Kamp, had ten years
experience working on salvage vessels before joining Greenpeace.
Another vessel may be required to tow the 8,000-ton Nisshin Maru
beyond Antarctic waters through the stormy "Roaring Forties"
weather, though we'll be making every effort to take the Nisshin
Maru all the way into port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we recognise the humanitarian and environmental need to
assist the Nisshin Maru, we are not in the business of salvaging a
whaling ship in order for it to start whaling again next season,"
added Thomas. "This tragedy should mark the end of this terrible
business and the government funding should be invested not in a new
or repaired ship, but in something that the Japanese people can
truly benefit from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;The Esperanza crew weblog has the latest updates from the Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Live webcam&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/live-webcam"&gt;See what the Esperanza sees on the live webcam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	US mobile phone company Motorola has backtracked on a promise to remove toxic chemicals from its products. While competitors like Sony Ericsson and Nokia are living up to their commitments to remove toxic chemicals, Motorola is not answering the call to clean up.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/5/motorola-breaking-promises-to.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Motorola: breaking promises to remove toxic chemicals from its phones.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years we have been pressuring leading
companiesto  remove the most toxic chemicals from their products. 
Withcompanies as diverse as H&amp;amp;M, Puma, Adidas, Hewlett Packard
andNokia, we have scored some notable successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many chemicals ineveryday products are now common environmental
pollutants. Almost everyone has dozens of man-made chemicalsin
their body, and the effects of these chemical cocktails on our
healthare largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/big-brands-clean-up111/"&gt;
October 2005 we congratulated Motorola&lt;/a&gt; for joining thegood guys
when they made toxic clean-up promises. In a &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25549/motoletter.pdf"&gt;July
2005 letter, Motorola&lt;/a&gt;committed to phase out all toxic
brominated flame retardants (BFRs) inits mobile phones by mid 2007
and to provide a phase out date for thehazardous plastic PVC by
March 2006. But after follow-up talks on theirprogress we received
a &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/documents/motoletter2.jpg"&gt;letter
on 15 May 2006&lt;/a&gt; stating that Motorola cannot phase out BFRs and
PVC from their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola's letter makes several excuses for not keeping
theirpromise. But other mobile phone companies have shown us
progress ratherthan excuses. Sony Ericsson has already removedBFRs
from all their models except one. Nokia has already removed PVC
inall new models and all new components will be free of BFRs from
1stJanuary 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the other companies that made commitments in 2004 and 2005
it istime to put words in to action. Both LG electronics and
Samsung arecurrently behind on their promises but still working
towardselimination of these toxic chemicals. Both companies have
large productranges from cameras to refrigerators that can make
elimination from thewhole product range more complex. Motorola
makes mainly mobile phonesso it doesn't even have the excuse of a
diverse product range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out how the top electronics companies &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
compare on eliminating toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; and consider who you
want to get your money next time you go shopping for
electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;So Hello? Motorola? If your competitors can make their products greener, why can't you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org/"&gt;Strong laws are needed to force all companies to remove toxic chemicals from their products. Speak out in support of strong European law on toxic chemicals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=motorolahangup"&gt;Give now to help our campaign for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Esperanza is currently staying close by the Japanese government's whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, which was disabled by fire on Thursday. This afternoon, we received a radio call from the whaling crew to tell us that the body of their missing colleague, 27-year-old Kazutaka Makita, had been found. We offered our condolences to the crew and would like to extend them to Kazutaka Makita's wife and family.

            The Esperanza (foreground) and the Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru, disabled by a recent fire.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza had arrived at the location in the Ross Sea at
about 07.00 (New Zealand daylight time) today. Two ships - the
re-supply and re-fuelling vessel &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; and one
of the harpoon, or catcher boats  - were tied either side of the
&lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;.  Nearby were two more catcher boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Esperanza arrived, a US Coast Guard
icebreaker, the &lt;i&gt;Polar Sea&lt;/i&gt; appeared. They  said they were
also here to assess the situation. The Yushin Maru then asked our
campaigner from Japan, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/01/sakyo.html"&gt;
Sakyo&lt;/a&gt; to help translate between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Weather conditions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived the weather conditions around the ships was
quite good, with calm seas and clear visibility, but several
icebergs and loose ice nearby. But the weather forecasts indicate
that might well change  over the next couple of days. Over the
course of the day we saw once again how quickly conditions can
change here. The sunny morning turned into a cloudy snowy midday
and then once more into sunshine in the afternoon, but with
considerably more ice around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First contact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first arrived, Sakyo radioed the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;,
but received no answer. He then radioed the catcher boat, the
&lt;i&gt;Yushin Maru&lt;/i&gt; and repeated the assurance that the Esperanza
had come to help. They responded, asking us to standby and
requesting that we assess the ice conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza's helicopter made an initial aerial assessment of
the situation. After flying over the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;, it looked
fairly normal, with no sign of fire on the decks, or any sign of
damaged equipment. There was a lot of power cabling and ropes slung
between the catcher boat and the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;. The ship's
decks were white with snow and  approximately 12 people were
visible on the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Offer of help&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we offered to tow the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; north, in
order to assist and ensure there was no further threat to the
environment from the disabled vessel. The Fisheries Agency of Japan
responded by calling us "terrorists" an unhelpful response, given
the potential for further risk and danger in this already serious
humanitarian and environmental situation in depths of the Ross
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; is secured - to two other
ships, which takes care of short-term difficulties. It's been
reported that one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt;, could tow
the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt;. However, Frank Kamp, the Esperanza's
captain, says that the &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; clearly isn't the
best option - and he has ten years experience on salvage vessels.
The &lt;i&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/i&gt; is too big and too difficult to
manoeuvre should more problems arise. As it stands, we're still the
best option should the &lt;i&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/i&gt; need to be towed out of
the Ross Sea, so we'll wait nearby to see what happens in the
coming hours and days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Something is rotten in the state of Denmark == and beyond&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the world, other pro-whaling nations have been
getting themselves into trouble. While at the so-called
"normalisation" (commercialisation of whaling) meeting in Tokyo,
Danish IWC commissioner Ole Samsing suggested excluding both media
and NGOs from future International Whaling Commission (IWC)
meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We responded, questioning whether or not we had
&lt;i&gt;misunderstood&lt;/i&gt; Mr Samsing. The media seems to have seized
upon this, and asked Mr Samsing for clarification. He repeated his
suggestions to the journalists, which has caused a scandal in
Denmark, where the foreign minister will now have to explain
Denmark's position in the IWC in parliament, where he is sure to be
grilled by the environmental committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Nicaragua scandal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Nicaragua, another whaling scandal has broken out.
Two newspapers have published articles on a scandal involving a Mr
Marenco, who was at the "normalisation" representing Nicaragua. The
thing is, Mr Marenco &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; to be the IWC commissioner, during
a former, highly corrupt government. He wasn't in Tokyo as an
official representative of Nicaragua at all - his bosses at the
ministry thought that he had left on holidays! (Read an update
about this from our Oceans Campaigner Shane on the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/02/anything_but_normal.html"&gt;
Ocean Defender weblog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some news from the good guys in whaling:, the
environment minister of Costa Rica, which is a pro-conservation
country, has announced that the country will be voting at the IWC
meeting in Anchorage, Alaska in May. Costa Rica had been having
some problems reconciling debts with the IWC, but has managed to
clear these debts though local private entities. Welcome back,

	Our ship the Esperanza is still standing by the stricken whaling ship, Nisshin Maru, disabled by fire in the Southern Ocean.  We have already provided information on ice conditions and are in radio contact with the Nisshin Maru crew.  We are all hoping the weather holds to avoid increased risk of an oil spill.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The disabled Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru with a re-fuelling vessel and hunter vessel tied alongside. Fire broke out on the Nisshin Maru on Thursday and one man is still missing. The Greenpeace ship Esperanza is close by, and has repeated the offer to assist the whaling fleet including possibly towing her out of the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our media officer on board the Esperanza, Sara Holden, said the
weather got marginally worse today.   "It's still not bad by
Southern Ocean standards, but the wind is picking up, visibility is
reduced and the temperature is falling," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, the whaling "spotter" vessel the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Kaiko Maru &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arrived in the area and we were told that the second such vessel
is on route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to offer assistance, including towing if
necessary, and are urging the Japanese authorities to do whatever
is needed to get the disabled vessel out of this area as soon as
possible. If the weather worsens, which is fairly likely in
Southern Ocean conditions,  a ship the size of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can easily flounder and sink and with an estimatedthousand tons
of oil aboard, it could present a major environmentaldisaster in
the pristine Antarctic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza is a former Russian firefighting vessel and has
the equipment on board necessary to tow the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, as well as a captain with 10 years' salvage experience. It is
unknown whether the ships in the Japanese fleet have the right
equipment, and our captain informs us that in any case the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oriental Bluebird&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, the whaling fleets' refuelling vessel, is too large to
manoeuvre the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nisshin Maru&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to safety in rough weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we have been using our helicopter, Tweety, for aerial
surveys to assessthe ice conditions nearby.  The pack ice to the
south of our positionhas moved 3 miles north in the last 24 hours
and is now only 10 milesaway.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists took to the streets across the globe on Valentine's Day to send a message of love to Japan from 28 different countries, while at the same time demanding the government end high seas whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace manga-girl Stina met the head secretary of the Japanese embassy in snowy Stockholm, but only if the "potentially dangerous" flowers were left outside the gates. We delivered our message - we love Japan, but whaling is meaningless and breaks our hearts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Greenpeace volunteers carried a giant Valentine's
card, addressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to pro-whaling members of the International Whaling Commission
(IWC),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;currently meeting to discuss "normalising" the Commission, which
read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Normalization Means Protection, Not Whaling". &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/ocean-defenders-tv"&gt;
Check it out on Ocean Defenders TV ("To Japan, With Love").&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fax was also sent to the Nisshin Maru - the factory ship of
the whaling fleet, which read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We Love Japan, but Whaling Breaks Our Hearts! 69 percent of
your fellow Japanese do not support what you are doing in the
Sanctuary and there is virtually no market for what you are
producing. The "research" you have been ordered to carry out is not
wanted by scientists and the meat is not wanted by the Japanese
people. On this Valentine's Day, a day for spreading love we ask
once again that you leave the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and
return to port."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, flowers, hearts, chocolates, kisses, whale-watching
discounts and romantic gondola trips were delivered by Greenpeace
activists to embassies and tourists in France, Germany, Chile,
Italy, Australia, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands,
Costa Rica, Fiji, Guatemala, Greece, New Zealand, Spain, Russia,
Uruguay, Ireland and the US. (Check out the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/image-collections/we-love-japan-valentines-from?MM_URL=webstory"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;To Japan, with love&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not just frivolous fun. We want to send a clear message
that we are not anti Japanese, we simply oppose whaling," said
Junichi Sato, whales campaign leader in Greenpeace Japan. "We know
that 69 percent of Japanese &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whaling-poll-japan/"&gt;
do not support&lt;/a&gt; what their government is doing in the Southern
Ocean and 95 percent never or rarely eat whale meat. Whaling does
not belong in the 21st century and the only way forward for the IWC
is to start working for the whales and not the whalers," Sato
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship the Esperanza is in the Southern Ocean right now,
pursuing the whaling fleet.  But you can campaign with us - take
action now at &lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;whales.greenpeace.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a Valentine!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/take-action/e-cards/size-matters-whale-e-card?MM_URL=DOOwebstory"&gt;Send a Valentine to a friend and show your love for the whales!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship's weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Keep up with the crew and get all the news from on the ground in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On Sunday 12 February, the Esperanza received a distress call.  This time it was from the Japanese Government whaling fleet's unarmed sighting vessel, the Kaiko Maru, claiming a collision with the Sea Shepherd vessel Robert Hunter.  "We completely condemn any violent action by anyone. Potentially endangering lives in the middle of the Southern Ocean is unacceptable," said Karli Thomas, expedition leader on board the Esperanza.

            Where the focus should be: stopping the killing of whales. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza offered immediate assistance, heading at full
speed to their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand first
reports stated the Kaiko Maru was "under attack." Later reports
claimed a collision between the Sea Shepherd vessel Robert Hunter
and the Kaiko Maru, with the Robert Hunter receiving a hole in the
hull above the water line and the Kaiko Maru suffering unspecific
damage to its propeller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karli adds, "While these three vessels are engaged in a
potentially life threatening incident, just over the horizon hunter
ships with grenade tipped harpoons could be killing whales. That is
where the focus should be."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 18.15, the Rescue Coordination Centre of New
Zealand requested that the Esperanza "stand down". The Rescue
centre was informed that we would remain within VHF range if
assistance were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ship weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders"&gt;Read reports straight from the Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Join an online campaign or start your own.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in January, two corporate villains where hogging
thelimelight. Star bad guy Monsanto &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/monsanto-pays-fine-for-bribery/"&gt;
added bribery&lt;/a&gt; to their litany ofenvironmental crimes. Desperate
to get its dodgy GE cotton planted inIndonesia it paid bribes for
officials to 'forget' about pesky detailslike an environmental
impact assessment. Caught red handed thecorporation that claims
"integrity, honesty and decency" had to pay aUS$1.5m fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the world we highlighted how Kimberly
Clark,makers of the famous Kleenex tissue, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kleenex-destroys-ancient-fores/"&gt;
makes millions from destroyingancient forests&lt;/a&gt; to make tissues
destined to be flushed down the toilet.Despite the absurdity of
turning thousand year old trees into toiletpaper and other tissue
products, Kimberly Clark continues to proudly boast that its
productscontains no recycled paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, the one and currently only, global effort to tackle
globalwarming, the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kyoto-protocol-becomes-law/"&gt;
Kyoto Protocol became law&lt;/a&gt;, despite the best efforts of
thefossil fuel funded nay-sayers. They first claimed it wasn't
needed, thensaid it would never work and finally predicted not
enough countrieswould sign it into law. How wrong they were...&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, Xerox showed that forests are best left as homes
forendangered animals and indigenous people by &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/xerox-gets-the-message/"&gt;
promising not to turnancient Finnish forests into copy paper&lt;/a&gt;.
Shame &lt;a href="http://www.kleercut.net/en/"&gt;Kimberly Clark&lt;/a&gt;
stillappears to have Kleenex stuffed in its ears to when such
common sensemoves are suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April brought more good news. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxic-tech-victory/"&gt;
Sony Ericsson announced a commitment tophase out toxic
chemicals&lt;/a&gt; in its products after pressure from
ourcyberactivists. Later in the year other large electronic
companies like&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/lg-toxic-committment-111/"&gt;
LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/big-brands-clean-up111/"&gt;
Motorola&lt;/a&gt; followed suit in our campaign to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt;
pull the plug on dirtyelectronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also after four years of legal wrangling the French courts
agreed withus and declared the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant
an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-cogema-guilty/"&gt;
illegalnuclear waste dump&lt;/a&gt;. In the same month a huge leak at the
UK nuclearreprocessing plant in Sellafield was discovered, a mere
nine mothsafter it started! &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/sellafield-springfield/"&gt;
Homer Simpson&lt;/a&gt; would be truly proud of such a level ofnuclear
ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whales in Danger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="70337" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan chose April to announce it is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/japan-doubles-whale-quota/"&gt;
doubling the amount of whales itkills&lt;/a&gt; each year, allegedly for
'science'. Not content with only killingmore minke whales, it
announced plans to kill endangered humpback andfin whales. Imagine
China researching giant pandas with rifles orUganda chopping up
mountain gorilla's to discover what they eat. That'swhy we are out
now in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/"&gt;stormy seas of
the Southern Ocean to stop thehunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May started with the sad news of the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/bob-hunter/"&gt;passing
of Bob Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, who perhapsmore than anyone was the inventor of
Greenpeace in the early 70's.During that period his madcap
creativity, strategic smarts, andhard-nosed journalistic sense of
story would indelibly mark our brandof action.  From the pack ice
of Newfoundland, where he dyed thewhitecoats of harp seal pups to
make them commercially worthless, tothe Pacific Ocean where he
stood between Russian harpoons and thewhales, he inspired a new
kind of personal environmental activism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="158543" mode="story"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first campaigns Bob was part of was the campaign
againstwhaling. Even now we need to defend the whales, and not just
from theJapanese. That's where our whale embassy in Korea comes in.
We were&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-activists-threatened/"&gt;
taking action in May&lt;/a&gt; to head off moves within Korea to follow
Japan andreopen commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 55,000 people joined us on a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/virtual-march/"&gt;virtual
march against theslaughter of whales&lt;/a&gt; at the annual meeting of
the International WhalingCommission. This strong show of public
opinion helped &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/iwc-success/"&gt;prevent
Japanesemoves&lt;/a&gt; to reopen the commercial slaughter, for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foot in mouth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just have to wait for your enemies to make a fool
ofthemselves in public. Thousands of scientists are calling for a
ban ondestructive bottom trawling. But a New Zealand fisheries boss
knewbetter when he claimed bottom trawling nets never touched the
sea floorand &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/claptrap-substantiated/"&gt;
Greenpeace claims were "unsubstantiated claptrap"&lt;/a&gt;. A few days
laterwe took shots of bottom trawling nets without many fish, but
plenty ofrare corals smashed off the sea bottom. That claptrap was
*substantiated,* mister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, the European Union moved to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxic-toy-story/"&gt;
ban certain toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; fromchildren's toys, only seven
years after we first highlighted theproblem. But the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/REACHvote111"&gt;battle
for wider controls on toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; in Europerages on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/random-house/"&gt;large
book publishers&lt;/a&gt; joined our campaign to make &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/greenpeace-book-campaign/"&gt;
ancientforest friendly books&lt;/a&gt; helping to ensure &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/harry-potter-111/"&gt;
some editions of books likeHarry Potter&lt;/a&gt;, which features
fictional enchanted forests, doesn't meanpulping real life
endangered forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was also the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/rw20-commemoration-107/"&gt;
20th anniversary of the bombing for the RainbowWarrior&lt;/a&gt; by the
French Secret Service, murdering the photographerFernando
Pereira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Silly fig leaves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries August is known as the silly season for news.
Step upMonsanto (once again) for their &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/monsanto-pig-patent-111/"&gt;
patent claim on that well-knownMonsanto invention, the pig&lt;/a&gt;. Not
content with attempting to control thefood chain it now seems to be
branching out into trying to controlanimal breeding as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the news was the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/USAsiaPacClimatePact111"&gt;
US - Australian climate pact&lt;/a&gt; that was reallynothing more than a
tiny fig leaf that completely fails to cover theirenormous
inadequacies on tackling global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September was dominated by the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/rita-katrina-global-warming-911/"&gt;
strongest hurricane season on record&lt;/a&gt;,which wreaked havoc in the
Caribbean, Southern US and Central America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pandering to profit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, European politicians played along to the tune of
bigbusiness and ignored their own environmental advice by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/EU-vote-on-F-gas-111"&gt;
failing to banglobal warming gases&lt;/a&gt;. Given some &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxicbarrosoverheugenreach111/"&gt;
politicians are so friendly with dirtyindustry&lt;/a&gt; we offered to
move them to new jobs with their best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flying jaguars prevail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November saw many Argentine celebrities enter stage right to add
theirvoice to our campaign against the bulldozing of pristine
forests. Alongwith a helping hand from a certain famous former
footballer the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-argentina-333/"&gt;

Argentina&lt;/a&gt; is notturned in to soya farms.&lt;/p&gt;

rubber-stamping of nuclear power as the answer toglobal warming.
Although Tony has already made up his mind he's havingan 'energy
review' to make sure he is proved right. Even if he iscompletely
wrong. Sounds just a bit like the run up the Iraq war all
overagain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While scientists announced 2005 was the warmest year in the
Northen Hemisphere sincerecords began, politicians were &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kyoto-stronger-91205/"&gt;
discussing tackling global warming&lt;/a&gt; in adistinctly chilly
Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;That seems like a good point to bringthe curtain down on our 2005. A little bit of everything, except maybea little love interest. Maybe in 2006.....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We are here amongst the icebergs of the Southern Ocean, preparing to take direct action to save whales from deadly harpoons in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. But is the  momentum that created the Sanctuary now slipping away? Does the world need a wake-up call? Karli Thomas, on board the Esperanza, ponders the state of the moratorium on commerical whaling.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Japanese Fisheries Agency whaling fleet leaves  Shimonoseki, Japan bound for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with plans to harpoon 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every single person on this ship comes from a country
thatsays they are opposed to whaling. But saying you are opposed
towhaling, and then doing something about it are two different
things;there is a whole spectrum of action and inaction that lies
between. So,while we are here amongst the icebergs of the Southern
Ocean, preparingto take direct action to save whales from Japanese
Government's whalingfleet's deadly harpoons... what is going on in
the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The changing face of the IWC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From one International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting to the
next,the Japanese government works away at recruiting new countries
to votepro-whaling... However, although the IWC started life as
anorganisation that represented fifteen whaling nations in the
divvyingup of the oceans' whales and tried to keep things from
getting too farout of hand - the IWC has now changed. Over time,
nations that wantedto see whales protected began joining, giving
strength and a voice forthe whales. Those years saw the
introduction of the moratorium oncommercial whaling and the
establishment of the Southern Ocean WhaleSanctuary. But is that
momentum now slipping away, and the majorityeroding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;St Kitts and Nevis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the IWC meeting at St Kitts and Nevis gave everyone
awake-up call. The year before they were to host the IWC, the
governmentreceived hundreds of millions of yen from Japan for
fisheriesdevelopment. Six hundred and seventeen million to be
exact. Comemeeting time, they refused entry to the Greenpeace ship
Arctic Sunrise,and arrested Greenpeace activists during a peaceful
protest in whichthey were erecting 945 whale tails on a beach,
symbolising the whalesdue to be killed in the upcoming hunt. At the
meeting itself,pro-whaling countries attempted to abolish the
Southern Ocean WhaleSanctuary. Although established twelve years
earlier with only a singlevote (Japan) against it, the Sanctuary
now retained only a slimmajority: 33 votes to 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wake-up call&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that was just the wake up call that was needed. Since
then,Croatia and Slovenia, both pro-conservation countries, have
joined theIWC. There is hope for others to finalise their
membership, in time toshore up support for the whales at the
Anchorage meeting in May. Othercountries with debts to the
organisation - it's not cheap to belong ­have lost their right to
vote. Peru, Kenya and Costa Rica, which haveall supported whales in
the past, have lost their votes in this way.And then, there are
those countries where the government simply - forwhatever reason -
votes against the wishes of their people. Denmark andNicaragua both
vote with the Japanese government, though at home theirpublic are
supportive of whale conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2006 poll done by WWF in 10 poor developing countries,
recruitedby the Japanese Government to vote with it at the IWC,
found that innine out of ten of these countries, more people
thought that theircountry should vote against commercial whaling
than favoured a vote forit. In one Caribbean country which is a
particularly vocal supporter ofJapan, 79 percent of the population
opposed whaling and only 14 percent supported it.In seven of these
countries, people were not even aware that theircountry was a
member of the IWC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Is your government taking action?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As May draws closer, and the next meeting of the IWC looms, we
needto do all we can to protect whales, not just from the immediate
dangerof explosive harpoons, but from the longer-term threat of
theirprotection being gradually eroded. That's why the expedition
to theSouthern Ocean is just one part of what we are doing. Each
member ofour crew knows that whatever we do here will be in vain if
&lt;b&gt;our&lt;/b&gt;countries aren't working at a political level to ensure
they have thesupport they need at the IWC. And all those
campaigners and activistsout there (you all!) - in countries that
are on the brink of joiningthe IWC, countries that need to pay off
their debts, countries whosegovernments are not representing their
own people with their IWC votes,or are not doing enough to support
the whales - can join this effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whales.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Make sure your government is in Anchorage in May, voting for the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Talk to crew&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2007/02/whaling_the_international.html"&gt;Respond to this article on our weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>IWC "Normalisation" Meeting: Catch More Whales</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iwc-normalisation-meeting-c/</url><text>
	After three days of meetings in Tokyo, the pro-whaling members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) have concluded that the best plan to move forward is to keep hunting more whales.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/2/normalization-meet-1.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan spokesperson Junichi Sato discusses vote buying outside the "Normalization" meeting for the IWC, organised by the Japanese government.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not exactly surprised - the mission statement of this
meeting was, after all '&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;to put forward specific measures to resume the function ofthe IWC as a resource management organisation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'.   "That basically meanshunting whales, explains Shane
Rattenbury, Head of Our Oceans campaign, who was at the
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government this morning presented a new proposal
for what they claim is "small scale" coastal whaling, but rather
than continue to call it science, it is now being referred to as
"community whaling".  However, the plan remains unaltered - to
catch 220 whales, despite having virtually no market, no scientific
justification, and no community benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Business as usual&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a clear sign that 'normalisation of the IWC' simply
means continuing with the current situation - catch as many whales
as possible," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan whales
campaigner. "No new ideas have come from this meeting.  The only
concrete proposals are to have secret ballots at the IWC, to hold
closed meetings, to exclude NGO's where possible, and to keep
catching the same number of whales." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear the IWC needs to be modernised - to increase
transparency, and to explore ways to protect whales for the future.
The onus now clearly rests on the governments from other countries
to seize the initiative, and make the IWC a body that works for the
whales and not for the whalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shane added that perhaps the best way to sum up this meeting is
to let the delegates speak for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I have worked for 25 years in European affairs and 13 years in theBrussels Council of Ministers, which works very well, because there isno access to meetings for press and NGO’s&lt;/span&gt;"
- one delegate evidently committed totransparency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; am a human being, and I get frustrated. I want to see theresumption of whaling as soon as possible&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" - the Chair of the Normalisation meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

	From meeting rooms in Montreal to coal-fired power plants in Germany and Thailand to ports hosting shiploads of illegal nuclear waste, Greenpeace has been in action against global warming around the world in the last two weeks.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace ended a three-day occupation of the Map Ta Phut coal power plant when the government agreed to a review of its energy policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;Update 9
December:  In a major breakthrough, the Thai National Economic and
Social Advisory Council of thePrime Minister's office  has
committed to  review theGovernment's energy policy.  We are ending
our blockade of the Map Ta Phut coal facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold"&gt;"Greenpeace
considers this amajor victory for the Thai people," said Greenpeace
Southeast Asiaspokesperson Tara Buakamsri from the sit-in which had
disrupted theplant's operations today. "Thailand has a vast
potential for clean,renewable energies such as modern biomass, wind
and solar. It's time toshift government policy towards them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/asia-energy-revolution/"&gt;South
East Asian Energy Revolution campaign&lt;/a&gt;entered its third day of
activity today at one of Asia's largestcoal-fired power plants.
Activists from Thailand, the Philippines, and the United States
climbed theloading crane of the BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in
Thailand andunfurled banners demanding the plant's immediate
closure on Wednesday, calling onthe Thai government to phase out
coal power and to commit to renewableenergy.  On Thrusday they
added a camp onan electricity pylon, and on Friday blockaded the
entrance to the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the main cause of climate change in Thailand and
SoutheastAsia.  Greenpeace demands that construction on this site
bestopped and a thorough review of the Thai Government's
coal-drivenenergy plan be undertaken immediately," said Greenpeace
Southeast Asiaspokesperson Tara Buakamsri from the camp. "We will
stay here until ourdemands are met."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/banner-on-crane-at-site-of-wha.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is causing severe hardship in Thailandandacross
the Southeast Asia region, and according to Tara,  "Plants like
BLCP are the main culprits."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany earlier this week, the most polluting coal plant in
Europe provided theplatform for a simple message: "CO2 Kills."  The
owner of the plant is planning ten new brown-coal power units, one
ofwhich together with the plant we've occupied will emit more CO2
thanthe entire nation of NewZealand.  Twenty Greenpeace activists
occupied the stack for more than 60 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/RWEcoalprotestgermany.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InMontreal, 181 countries are meeting to determine what the
world isgoing to do about global warming. A key issue atthe summit
is how other countries will deal with strong pressure fromthe US to
ignore climate change.  Our message to the delegates? Ignore the US
administration. Take action. (&lt;a href="http://climate2005.greenpeace.ca/"&gt;Updates here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the United States, Japan, Germany,France, Bangladesh,
Brazil, Australia and South Africa, people took to the streetson
Saturday to demand just that. 7,000 marched onMontreal alone. Five
environmental groups including Greenpeacedelivered a petition
signed by 600,000 Americans to the US consulate inMontreal, calling
upon President Bush and the US Congress to help slowglobal
warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Greenpeace activists made clear thatthe government
won't be able to build more dirty nuclear power plantswithout a
fight, as they &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/blair-nuclear-announcement-scu/"&gt;
occupied the room in which Tony Blair planned to outline a review
of the UK's energy future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/wrong-answer.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France, Greenpeace &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-nuclear-waste-shipment/"&gt;
blocked a shipment of nuclear waste bound&lt;/a&gt;for Russia in an
action illustrating one more reason why nuclear poweris not a
solution to climate change. The waste is currently in transitalong
more than a dozen European coastlines, a terrorist target and
atelling reminder that nobody knows what to do with nuclear
waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Asia and global warming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to climate change, Asia is a place of particular
opportunity and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/videos/south-east-asia-drought"&gt;
Catastrophic droughts&lt;/a&gt; across Thailand  this year cost the
countryUS $193 million and untold human suffering. The
Thaigovernment has set a target of delivering 8% of its energy
fromrenewables by 2011, a goal which we don't believe the
government canmeet if it continues to divert funding from
renewables into coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25616/wind-and-sun.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewables can provide 35 percent of Thailand's energy supply
by2020; there already exists enough biomass to power 25 percent of
thecountry's electricity needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climatechange is a reality but so too are the solutions," said
Jean-FrancoisFauconnier of Greenpeace International aboard the
Rainbow Warrior. "Wind, solar and  modern biomass power are already
bigbusiness  not only in Europe but also in China. The potential
in Thailand is equally huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"International financialinstitutions like the Asian Development
Bank and the Japan Bank forInternational Cooperation  should stop
 financing coal. Theycontinuously talk up their  support for
renewables yet we've seen verylittle in the way of funds being
re-directed  towards thoseenergies. It's time for less talk and
more action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior is inBangkok on the
Thailand leg of its 10-week Asia Energy Revolution Tour,exposing

	A child sits in a mountain of electronic waste, covered in toxic chemicals, pulling apart components to retrieve tiny bits of metal; this is the face of free trade your government does not want you to see. As trade ministers from around the world arrive in Hong Kong for the World Trade Organization (WTO) summit, they claim that free trade is good for you. You will excuse this child if he disagrees.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            He's not reaping the benefits of "Free Trade."  He's being poisoned by what we throw away.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is not just the place where trade ministers
attendreceptions. Hong Kong is also a 'freeport' for the world's
electronicwaste. China is quickly becoming the world's trash bin.
As much as4,000 tonnes of toxic e-waste is discarded every
hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manyelectronic products are routinely, and often illegally,
shipped fromEurope, Japan and the US to China. Dumping them there
is cheaper thantaking proper care of them at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our mobile phones,computers and other electronic
products are made using toxicingredients, workers at yards such as
in Guiyu, China, risk exposurewhen they break the products apart by
hand, under appalling conditions.Guiyu is where this boy is
sitting. This is what "free trade" lookslike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle vs More, Faster, Cheaper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsat the WTO meeting aim to eliminate tariffs on
electronic goods as partof the funnily named NAMA negotiations.
NAMA stands for NonAgricultural Market Access. Most products you
see in the shops arecovered by these negotiations. Free trade in
electronic goods willresult in more electronic goods being traded.
Sadly, as long aseffective social and environmental regulations are
missing, this willlead to even more electronic waste being dumped
in scrap-yards such asGuiyu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to its preamble, the WTO exists "to protectand
preserve the environment" and to achieve "the optimal use of
theworld's resources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big words. But in reality, the WTO forcescountries to compete to
trade more. As a result, the use of naturalresources is spiralling
upwards. One fifth of global oil consumption isused just to move
goods around the world. And trade negotiatorscontinue to ignore the
environment. This is true for electronic goodsand the waste they
will inevitably become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Can't see the forest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is most shameful in the case of forests - another "product"
covered by the NAMA negotiations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheEuropean Union asked a respected university to conduct
a"sustainability impact assessment" of trade liberalization on
forests.As we long suspected, the study shows, that trade
liberalization fuelsthe destruction of the world's last remaining
ancient forests. Sadly,the researchers appear to have wasted their
time. Governments,unwilling to admit unpalatable truths, still aim
to move forward withthe NAMA negotiations in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this, Greenpeace says:STOP. Governments must halt the NAMA
negotiations. Plans forliberalization of vital environmental
assets, such as forests, must beabandoned. We must force
governments to admit the real face of freetrade and stop our waste
being dumped on children in Guiyu.&lt;/p&gt;

	A toxic chemical slick 80km long has reached a Chinese city of 3.8 million people and is threatening Russian cities further downstream.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rapid economic growth and lax enforcement of environmental laws is leading to widespeard pollution in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 13th, an explosion at a chemical factory in China's
JilinProvince released huge quantities of toxic pollution. Thirty
peoplewere injured and 10,000 resisdents had to be evacuated. But
later itwas revealed that the explosion had released about 100
tonnes of highlytoxic benzene into the Songhua river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benzene is a toxic, cancer-causing chemical which is damaging
bothduring short and long-term exposure. As the slick travelled
downstreamdead fish washed up on the banks and authorities in the
city of Harbinshut off water supplies sourced from the river to the
3.8 millionresidents. First it was claimed it was regular
maintenance, butauthorities later admitted water was shut off due
to the scale of thepollution heading for the city. Levels of
pollution in the river havebeen measured at 108 times the 'safe'
limit according to the Chineseenvironmental watchdog. It took 9
days for the Chinese authorities toadmit that water in the area may
have been contaminated by theaccident. The true extent of the
pollution from the explosion and leakmay never be known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents of Harbin have been forced to rely on bottled water
untilthe chemical slick clears the city. But further downstream
where theriver flows into Russia the city of Khabarovsk is on high
alert for thearrival of the polluted water in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the acute effects of the toxic slick may dissipate with
furtherdilution, the ecology of the river may take a long time to
recover andif any benzene has seeped into groundwater it will cause
long-termpollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dirty water for 300 million&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across China water pollution is a growing problem. About 70
percent ofChina's rivers and lakes are polluted due to industrial
pollution andlack of waste treatment plants. About 300 million
people are forced torely on polluted water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The environmental health of China is at risk from the short-term rush for economic growth. Like wise the environmental health of the planet is at risk from the rush for short-term financial gains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Swiss vote NO to GE</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/swissvoteno_333/</url><text>
	Last Sunday, people turned up at polling booths across Switzerland in a referendum to determine whether genetically engineered (GE) crops and animals can be grown in the alpine nation during the next five years. Their verdict in each and every one of the three main languages was the same, nein, non, no, to GE.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace action at Nestle headquarters in Switzerland, over repeated discovery of GE ingredients in the company's Asian products.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 26 cantons (administrative regions) that make up Switzerland
votedunanimously against GE crops and animals being grown in the
country.The national vote was 55.7percent in favour of the ban but
reached a high of 75.8 percent in thefarming canton of Jura. The
farmers of Switzerland are concerned notonly with theuncertain
health effects of GE crops but also that GE contaminationwould ruin
their fast-growing organic farming sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ban doesn't rid Switzerland of GE completely as GE field
trialswill still be allowed under the new moratorium and products
derivingfrom animals fed on GE crops can still be imported into the
country.Pending applications for GE food and animal feed could also
still beapproved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace hopes Switzerland's rejection of GE crops inspires
othersaround the world to stand up and say 'no' to genetic
engineering. Wealso encourage the Swiss public to continue to voice
its opposition tothis highly risky technology. Every route of
contamination must beclosed before people can rest assured their
plants and the food ontheir plates is not contaminated," said Geert
Ritsema, GreenpeaceInternational GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland is unique in the world in that it allows its
citizens adirect say in how they are governed via regular
referenda. With thelatest vote going against GE, the biotech
companies like Monsanto andSwitzerland's own Syngenta must be
hoping that the democratic urgedoesn't escape the land-locked
country and spread to other lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Switzerland are fortunate that their government
takesinto account their views before deciding important issues like
therelease of GE crops into the environment. Across many parts of
theworld, public opinion is similarly in opposition. But
somegovernments, seduced by promises of riches,  havebeen quick to
bypass or suppress public opposition and grant permissionfor
biotech companies to contaminate the environment with
geneticallyengineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the US, Canada and Argentina trying to force GE food onto
Europeanconsumers &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/gmo-lamy/"&gt;via
the WTO&lt;/a&gt;, the Swiss vote shows that the pro-GE forces arelosing
their grip. The rights of people to determine what food
ispermissible from the farm gate to their dining table must be
respected.With the Swiss voting against GE crops, the biotech
industry must nowrealise what the opinion polls across the world
has been showing for along time, people don't want GE food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the online opposition to GE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/sign-up"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and join the online opposition to Genetically Engineered foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=166_121"&gt;Help stop the contamination of our food and environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It has been a confrontational 24 hours for the PR people at computer giant Hewlett Packard (HP) with Greenpeace activists turning up at both their headquarters in the US and China. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Few HP employees probably know that their products end up as e-waste, or that the toxic contents end up poisoning Chinese workers, many of them children.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update March 8, 2006: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/hewlettpackardHPtoxicchallenge090306"&gt;HP rises to the toxic challenge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Workers were greeted by a bright orange blimp floating above
theentrance to the HP international headquarters in California.
Hangingfrom the blimp was an image of a Chinese girl clutching an
HPkeyboard surrounded by an electronic waste (e-waste) scrapyard
with theslogan - "HP = Harmful Products".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pirate radio station broadcast a message encouraging workers
andpassers-by to contact the HP CEO Mark Hurd to demand they make
cleanerproducts. The message was also delivered by phone to around
4000employees working at the headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"HP is a prime example of a dirty electronics company," said
GreenpeaceInternational toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska.  "It has
donelittle to eliminate hazardous materials in its products, and it
islagging behind some of its competitors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in China then delivered postcards to the employees at
HPheadquarters in Beijing along with e-waste components recovered
fromthe Guiyu, e-waste dump site in the Guangdong Province of
China. Theactivists, wearing boiler suits bearing the words "HP =
HarmfulProducts," urged HP employees to work from within and call
for hazardoussubstances in computer manufacture to be phased
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/hp-usa-china-action.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace believes that most HP employees are unaware of how
theirproducts become toxic e-waste and pollute the environment in
scrappingyards like Guiyu, in China. Armed with information we
believe they willask their managers to stop manufacturing such
products" said Zhao Yangfrom Greenpeace China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some electronics companies, such as Samsung, Sony, Sony
Ericsson,Nokia, LG and Motorola have taken a first step by
committing to theelimination of all types of brominated flame
retardants and PVC plasticfrom their products on set timelines. 
HP, Acer, Apple, Dell,Fujitsu-Siemens, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, and
Toshiba have, to date,made no such commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Helen Perivier explains, "The Probo Koala
is aninternational toxic crime scene and needs to be fully
investigated toestablish the full chain of culpability which led to
the tragic deadlyevents in the Ivory Coast," she said. "Only
through such aninvestigation can the guilty be brought to justice
and the lessonslearned in order to prevent this from happening
again."  We weredelighted to hear that the Estonian Authorities are
now taking suchaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dumping the West's waste ... in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thescandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties were reported
andprotests broke out on the streets of Abidjan against the
government,which was blamed for allowing the dumping.  Despite
this, theKorean-built, Greek-managed, Panamanian-flagged and
Dutch-charteredtanker was allowed to sail freely …until we blocked
it from leavingEstonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onthe basis of preliminary results it would appear that

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Radioactive waste is one more reason why nuclear power is not an answer to climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Russian freighter, the Kapitan Kuroptche, was preparing to
transportmore than 450 tons of radioactive uranium waste to Russia
when theactivists blocked cranes on the ship and the pier.  The
wasteoriginated from the Pierlatte uranium enrichment plant in the
RhoneValley. It's part of a thirty-year-old practice of dumping
nuclearwastes produced in Europe in Russia, where federal law
prohibits theimport of foreign waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;We're just putting it there for now: honest!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franceclaims the waste is going to Russia for reprocessing --
the process bywhich plutonium is separated from spent fuel -- but
in fact only asmall portion is treated.  In reality, it's simply
being put outof sight, out of mind, with no long-term solution for
what to do withit on the horizon.  Greenpeace has filed a case in
the Moscowdistrict court against the Russian government nuclear
export company,Tecksnabexport.  The nuclear industry would prefer
these shipmentshappened in secret, as they underscore a key reason
why nuclear fuel isnot a viable energy solution, and why nuclear
power is not a solutionto climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Vulnerable to attack, dangerously shipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butin addition to being illegal, the shipments are also highly
dangerous.Shipments between west European ports are regularly
transitting throughthe North Sea, Skagarak, the Baltic and the Gulf
of Finland beforearriving at St Petersburg.  The shipments are made
on general Russian-owned cargo vessels rather than purpose-built
ships,despite known hazards and risks. The transportation route
goes throughmajor cities such as St Petersburg (5 million
population) and Tomsk(0.5 million) and passes the coasts of
Belgium, the Netherlands,Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Norway and
Finland. An accidental release orterrorist attack could be
devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/12/transport-route.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report from Greenpeace, "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/european-rad-secret/"&gt;
Europe's Radioactive Secret&lt;/a&gt;", details the illegal nuclear waste
trade between Europe's nuclear industry and the Russian
Federation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nuclear wastes concerned are of two types: contaminated
uraniumresulting from reprocessing at the Cogema/Areva facilities
at la Hague,Normandy; and depleted uranium (DU) from nuclear fuel
enrichment atfacilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and
the UK. Thesefacilities support the day-to-day operation of
Europe's 135 nuclearreactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update 7 Dec 2005&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ElevenGreenpeace activists braving sub-zero temperatures on
board inflatableboats blocked theRussian cargo vessel 'Kapitan
Kuroptev' near Kronshtadt, some 30 kmwest of St. Petersburg,
Russia. The Kuroptev crew used water hoses onthe activists, the
resulting ice made continued protest impossible.Once the Kuroptev
has docked in St Petersburg the 450 tons ofradioactive uranium
waste is due tobe transported by rail for over 3,000 kilometers to
nuclear sites inSiberia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The containers used to transport the uranium wastedo not meet
current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standardsand pose
a serious risk during the thousands of kilometres journey tothe
Russian dump sites, where they are illegally stored or disposed.A
large percentage of the waste is in the form of hexafluoride
crystalswhich can react violently to water leading to dispersal of
toxic gas,inhalation of which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world urgently needs toshift its energy supply to clean,
safe, renewable energy. Delegates meeting in Montreal to discuss
the implementation of theKyoto Protocol need to remember that
nuclear power is not an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help.  Sign up as an Energy Revolutionary and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/climate-action-not-hot-air/"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Does this belong to you? Apple e-waste in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen the electronic graveyards in China and India where
old electronic devices end up, Macs included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'veseen children waist-deep in cables, keyboards and circuit
boardspicking through a soup of hazardous chemicals, including lead
andmercury, to find components or bits of metal they can sell.
We'veseen them breathing in dioxins as the PVC cables and casings
burnaround them, watched them stop drinking from local wells
polluted withheavy metals. Lives are being cut short for thousands
of children inthe developing world exposed to dangerous
chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not what Apple is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appleknows more about simple, "clean" design than any other
computermanufacturer on the planet. You'd expect Apple to be the
world leaderin clean environmental practice. But they're not.  Far
from it.Apple products contain hazardous substances which other
manufacturershave commited to stop using.  While Apple has
introduced a limitedtake-back policy in the US, other companies
have worldwide take-backand recycling programmes that are far
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/9/ilovemymac.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is going to make Apple change its ways?  You are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Think different: Green my Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wedecided to Think Different on this campaign.  We're not
hangingbanners off the Apple HQ or using our ships to blockade
their supplychain or bungy-jumping into the next MacWorld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we knowa force that Apple listens to, and which can make
Apple adopt cleanproduction policies and improve its recycling
programmes. It's Apple'scustomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple listens to the people who buy their product: it's one of
the things we all love about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andit's why we want you to run this campaign.  We want you to
createthe campaign T-shirt, pen the speech in which Steve Jobs
announces theGreening of Apple, shoot the Apple Ad that sets
Cupertino talking aboutclean production and take-back schemes. The
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple" target="_blank"&gt;Green my
Apple website&lt;/a&gt;has all the information and the raw materials you
need to get youstarted.  If you're creative, create. If you're
networked,network. There's plenty to do, and many hands make light
work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Come on, Steve. Be a hero for the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good products and good design ought to be good for theplanet.
That's an Apple kind of attitude, isn't it? So have a word
withSteve.  Let him know that you want clean ingredients in all
Appleproducts. Let him know you want Apple to provide a free
take-backprogram to reuse and recycle its products wherever they
are sold -- andnot just in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell him how much you love your Mac, and how badly you want it

	It’s that time of the year again, the six ships of the whaling fleet are leaving Japan and heading back to the culling ground, the “Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,” to carry out “scientific testing” on 1000 whales. The “scientific test” involves harpooning the whale, measuring and weighing the carcass, slicing and dicing, and finally delivering it to markets, boxed and frozen.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            SOUTHERN JAPAN The whaling ship Nisshin-maru  departs from Aruka port, Shimonoseki, Southern Japan together with a fleet of four catcher ships bound for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with the intention of killing 1,000 whales. Greenpeace called upon the Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) and the companies behind the whaling to immediately recall the fleet and cancel the cull.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TheInternational Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial
whaling in 1986. TheSouthern Ocean was declared a Whale Sanctuary
in 1994. Yetevery year  the Fisheries Agency ofJapan (FAJ) sends
the fleet of whalers back to the Southern Ocean via aloophole in
international law. The IWC has said it does not need thedata
produced by the 'research' and strongly urges Japan to call itoff.
The scale of the hunt leads only to one conclusion, that this
iscommercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sanctuary means refuge or safe haven, yet this year nearly
1,000whales will receive neither from the whaler's harpoon," warned
JohnFrizell of Greenpeace International. "The Sanctuary is there to
helpwhales recover after over a century of relentless persecution
sentpopulations plummeting. Japan should join all other countries
inrespecting the Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the FAJ announced at the annual meeting of
the IWCits intention to more than double its "scientific" cull to
935 minkewhales and to add 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales
over the nexttwo years. Both humpback and fin whales are listed as
endangeredspecies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan claims, "according to Japanese
culturalvalues… whales are viewed as a food source." However, an
opinion pollcommissioned in 2002 by the influential Japanese Asahi
newspaper foundthat only four percent of the Japanese population
regularly eat whalemeat nine percent rarely eat it; 53 percent
haven't eaten it sincechildhood and 33 percent have never eaten
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In reality few Japanese people view whale meat as a vital food
sourceand even fewer actually eat it. It is simply not true that
whaling isimportant to the Japanese public and the whaling fleet
should not leavefor the Antarctic whale sanctuary," said Mizuki
Takana of GreenpeaceJapan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAJ also claims that whales are contributing to the collapse
offish stocks. "Ninety nine per cent of the catch will be Southern
Oceanminke whales which eat krill and not fish. Only the newly
addedendangered Fin and Humpback whales eat fish," said John
Frizell, Oceanscampaigner at Greenpeace. "Are we really saying that
we cannot spare afew fish for endangered whales?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=WhaleScience"&gt;Sign up as a cyberactivist and help stop whaling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=96_102"&gt;Help Greenpeace defend our oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	One of our activists participating in a peaceful protest against a coal power plant outside Manila has been horrendously beaten by local plant security, who drew weapons and fired warning shots at people armed with nothing but a banner. Four other Greenpeace activists are also in hospital after having stones thrown at them.

            German activist Jens Loewe, 36, being looked after by Filipino Pam Palma and New Zealander Debra Gay Pristor after being beaten by personnel of Masinloc coal power plant in the Philippines.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;German volunteer Jens Loewe, 36, has been taken to a hospital

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is not the first violent reaction to a
peacefulGreenpeace protest in the Philippines. In 2002 during a
protestagainst the biggest coal-fired power station in the
Philippines asecurity guard fired a warning shot over the heads of
the activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace condemns this violent attack to a peaceful protest,"
saidGreenpeace Southeast Asia Energy Campaigner Red Constantino.
"It isdisproportionate to the nature of the protest which is a
peaceful, nonviolent protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're outraged that the Filipino plant personnel prefers
toprotect the interests of a power plant that brings more harm than
goodto people. Coal is the culprit here, not peaceful protest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists were at the plant to draw attention to
Australianand Japanese backing of the expansion of climate changing
coaldependency in Asia. "The Masinloc power plant displays the very
worstexcesses of the Philippine and Asian coal industry," said
Constantinoat the plant site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal is one of the primary causes of global warming.
Australia and Japanare underwriting global warming at a time when
the Philippines and Asiaare facing the likelihood of devastating
social and economicinstability from climate change precisely when
the country and the restof Asia are least able to deal with its
impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How can climate change criminalspollute the planet with impunity while peaceful protestors get beatenup and detained by police?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Deadly cargo dumped in the Ivory Coast</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ivory-coast-toxic-dumping/</url><text>
	Toxic waste from Europe openly dumped on the streets of an African capital city. Six people dead and thousands requiring medical treatment. The Ivory Coast cabinet resigns but still no one owns up to the dumping. How could this be allowed to happen?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties where
reported andprotests broke out on the streets against the
government, which wasblamed for allowing the dumping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the wastes are deadly. Four of the six
dead arechildren and 23 people have required hospital treatment so
far. Thefact that the toxic waste was dumped openly on the streets
of a city isshocking enough. The fact that the waste was delivered
by a shipchartered by Trafigura LTD (controlled by Dutch firm
Trafigura BeheerBV), who claimed they thought the waste would be
'properly treated' ina poor African nation raises serious questions
about why they sent itto Africa. The fact that international law
may have been broken makesit a serious scandal that such deadly
incidents still occur today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Back from the past?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We campaigned long and hard for an international ban on the
dumping oftoxic waste by rich countries in poor countries, which
resulted in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt;
Basel Ban in 1998&lt;/a&gt;.  So we want to know how the dumping
occurred, what was dumpedand who is responsible. A &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxic-waste-in-abidjan-green/"&gt;
full version of what we know to date&lt;/a&gt; isavailable but here is a
short summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 19 August, a ship called the Probo Koala unloaded a toxic
wasteshipment in Abidjan, the main economic capital of the Ivory
Coast.However it was not until the first week of September that the
incident came tolight. The Ivorian Ministry of Health announced an
extraordinarymeeting that led to the dismissal of its government on
6 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As international and/or local environmental laws may have been
broken,we are calling for a transparent and thorough investigation
by therespective international and local authorities. The facts
behind thisdeadly tragedy in the Ivory Coast remain obscured by the
vesselcharterer, Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to investigate the chain of events, but the lack of
transparency in the shippingindustry as a whole, and specifically
from Trafigura and various portauthorities, are hiding the facts
from the public.Official investigations on the national and
international levels areurgently called for to establish
liabilities, to indicate where nationsare failing to uphold their
international commitments and to make surethis deadly type of
export never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mystery movements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 2 the Probo Koala attempted to unload waste in
Amsterdam.Noting the strong-smelling nature of the waste and
probable toxic nature, harbour authoritiestold the ship that the
waste would be more expensive to dispose of. The ship refused to
pay extra treatment costs and leftAmsterdam. Where the ship went
between the 2 July and 19 August, andwhat it did with its toxic
cargo, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Abidjan the ship unloaded waste supposedly to be treated
by anIvorian waste handling firm. In fact the waste, which appears
toconsist of volatile hydrocarbons, was dumped at 11 sites in the
city.Symptoms reported by those who come in contact with the waste
includerespiratory problems, nausea, dizziness, vomiting (including
throwingup blood), burns and irritation from the toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will anyone take responsibility?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is established where the waste originated in Europe,
thatcountry could be liable to take back the waste. If the toxic
waste wasconsidered regulated under the Basel Convention and bound
for export,the Dutch Authorities could have prevented the ship
leaving with toxicwaste onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is obvious that the crisis could not have happened
without thelocal public and private complicity, the company
Trafigura clearlyshould be the centre of an investigation into any
attempt to takeadvantage of legal loopholes and grey areas to
assess if itdeliberately broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;

	Facing down stick-wielding personnel, water-canon-spraying marine police,and gun-wielding navy seals, five Greenpeace activists in Thailand have delayed a shipment of Australian coal from being unloaded at a controversial coal plant in Maptaphut, Thailand.

            The BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in Thailand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five activists chained themselves to the pier bumper and
hung banners that read 'Coal = climate change, Clean Energy Now'.
They remained for two hours before being detained by police with
the help of Navy seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 170,00 tonne carrier, MV Star Europe, carrying a large
shipment of coal from Newcastle, NSW (the world's largest coal
exporting port) has been anchored a few nautical miles away,
waiting for the area to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coal plant, BLCP,  is jointly owned by Banpu and Hong Kong
based China Light and scheduled to open in October. BLCP is a
classic example of dirty international financing by the likes of
Asian Development Bank and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The BLCP coal plant will exacerbate the impacts of climate
change, which is already starting to exact a heavy toll on the
people and economies of Thailand and Southeast Asia. It does not
help that Australia is fuelling climate change in the region with
its coal exports," said Tara Buakamsri of Greenpeace Southeast
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thailand must stop any further use of coal and put a policy in
place for the massive increase of renewable energy and energy
efficiency projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1,434 MW BLCP coal plant will release nearly 12 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, and once in operation this
plant alone will cause Thailand's carbon emissions to rise by
almost 6 percent a year, according to Greenpeace projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, emitting 29 percent more
carbon per unit of energy than oil and 80 percent more than gas,
and contributing significantly to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal and coal-fired power stations have been strongly opposed
by communities in the region. However, the Australian government
refuses to take action on global warming while ignoring climate
impacts on its own citizens and other countries in Asia. The whole
region will be further threatened by the increase of investments in
coal power plants across Asia many of which will rely on the supply
of Australian coal." said Catherine Fitzpatrick, Greenpeace
Australia Pacific energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	In what is becoming an annual event, increasingly frequent and more intense fires are sweeping through the tropical rainforests of Indonesia and Brazil. The burning of the rainforests not only threaten biodiversity in the affected areas but, by contributing towards climate change, they also put the entire planet at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/forestfires2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace team has investigated and documented the forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia, which have now become an annual phenomenon, thanks to the effects of unsustainable logging, and are the cause of a thick smog-like haze over the entire region which threatens the health of millions of people and adds to the problem of climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tropical latitudes, months pass without any rain and in the
dryseason forests become susceptible to fire. These can occur
naturallyand would normally not pose a serious problem, but
clearing land as aresult of logging or to make way for plantations
is exacerbating theproblem and every year the fires spread faster
and further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeaceteams in both Indonesia and Brazil have recorded the
scale of theinfernos and are clear about the reasons why they are
happening. Muchof the forests in the Indonesian province of Riau in
Sumatra arepeatland forests, so normally protected from fire by
their boggy environment,but industrial activity has changed all
that. The forests are beingcleared for plantations of oil palms and
acacia pulpwood for paper,creating the perfect conditions for fires
at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oncethese peat swamps are exposed due to logging," Greenpeace
forestcampaigner Hapsoro explained, "they dry out like a wet sponge
exposedto sunlight and become extremely flammable. Once it starts
burning,it's very difficult to stop without heavy rain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects ofthe Indonesian fire also spread across the region.
Smoke drifts acrossSouth East Asia, clogging the air above the
Malaysian peninsular andincurring the wrath of neighbouring
governments, and Hapsoro urged theIndonesian authorities to take
urgent measures. "The Indonesiangovernment must seriously
reconsider allowing any type of land clearingto be done in these
areas to minimise the possibility of large anduncontrolled forest
fires," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Brazilian Amazon,fires have been witnessed in several
protected areas and the Greenpeaceteam sent to investigate also saw
rampant deforestation and illegallogging. In the Jamanzim National
Forest, using natural resourcesresponsibly is permitted, but
intense logging activity has beenobserved within protected
areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both regions boast some of themost diverse varieties of plant
and animal life anywhere in the worldbut fragile habitats, already
under pressure from human activities, arebeing pushed even harder
by the increasing number and scale of thefires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rest of the world suffers too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainforestsplay a vital role in regulating the global climate
and the more treesthat are felled, the more unpredictable the
climate will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropicaldeforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global
carbon dioxideemissions, a staggering amount that explains why 75
percent of Brazil'sown carbon dioxide contribution comes from
forest conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butwith drought plaguing many areas - such as last year's
catastrophicevent in the Amazon - the forests dry out and become
even moresusceptible to fire. This in turn releases more carbon
dioxide and smoginto the atmosphere, accelerating climate change
and the cycle ofdestruction continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem for Brazil andIndonesia but for the
whole planet. Concrete efforts must be made at alocal level to
protect rainforests from illegal logging and conversionto
plantations, but there must also be international support to
backthis up. Sustainable management of the forests allows local
communitiesto support themselves and make a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=forest-fires"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=forest-fires"&gt;Make a donation and help save the forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The genetic engineering industry sank to a new low when it was revealed recently that US company Bayer's field trials of genetically engineered (GE) rice had contaminated rice exports. Japan moved fast and banned the US rice from coming into its ports. The EU quickly followed and placed import restrictions and testing regimes in place.  Now, Greenpeace research has uncovered a new example of contamination of the world's most important staple food. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/products-found-to-contain-ille.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/products-found-to-contain-ille.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Products found to contain illegal and untested genetically engineered rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently uncovered, and independently verified, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/IllegalChinaGErice"&gt;
that illegal GE rice from China has contaminated food products&lt;/a&gt;
in France, Germany and the UK. We've notified authorities that the
illegal GE rice poses serious health risks and we're calling upon
European governments to take immediate action to protect
consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace offices and Friends of the Earth in the UK tested
samples of rice products such as vermicelli, rice sticks and other
processed foods. Five positive samples were found containing an
illegal GE organism not approved anywhere in the world. However
this may only be the tip of the iceberg. Rice products are included
in everything from baby food to yoghurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level
responses", said Jeremy Tager, GE rice campaigner, Greenpeace
International. "Consumers should not be left swallowing
experimental GE rice that is risky to their health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice, genetically engineered to be resistant to
insects, contains a protein or fused protein (Cry1Ac) that has
reportedly induced allergic-like reactions in mice. Three
independent scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ScientistStatementHealthConcernsGErice" target="_blank"&gt;issued a statement backing the health concerns we
raised&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International is calling for immediate worldwide
recall, measures to ensure no further contaminated rice enters the
EU and the urgent implementation of a preventative screening system
for countries with high contamination risks. Demanding GE-free
certification for food from countries that grow and produce GE
crops is reasonable, cost effective, and necessary to protect
Europe's consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bayer's illegal GE rice in the US, this recent rice
contamination in China began with field trials; the rice is not
currently approved for commercial growing because of mounting
concerns over its safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innocent consumers again become the victims," says Tager. 
"Once illegal GE crops are in the food chain, removing them takes
enormous effort and cost. It is easier to prevent contamination in
the first place," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that
is grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens
biodiversity and poses unacceptable risks to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GE_rice_signup"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GE_rice_donate"&gt;In order to maintain our independence, we don't accept funding from governments or corporations.

	Some of the best-known laptops are contaminated with some of the worst toxic chemicals. Of the five top brands we tested Hewlett-Packard and Apple laptops showed the worst contamination levels.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/toxic-laptop-testing.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/toxic-laptop-testing.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Dismantling laptop prior to testing for toxic chemicals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independant Danish laboratory tested for the presence of
several toxicchemicals, including brominated flame retardants
(BFRs), polyvinylchloride plastic (PVC), and even lead, in brand
new laptops from fiveof the world's leading manufacturers (Acer,
Apple, Dell, HP, Sony). HPand Apple laptops contained the highest
levels of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been pressuring leading electronic companies to ditch
toxicchemicals in favour of safer alternatives. The laptop tests
reveal ifthe top companies are matching nice green words with real
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical lies?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results for HP revealed high levels of a number of chemicals in
itscomponents, in particular the highest levels by far of PBDEs (a
classof Brominated Fire Retardants) including something called
decaBDE. &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/productdesign/materialuse.html"&gt;
HP's website claims&lt;/a&gt; it removed decaBDE fromits products years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either HP is lying or HP needs to ask itssuppliers some tough
questions. Lead was also found in the soldering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP has been downgraded due to these results on our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Guide to GreenerElectronics&lt;/a&gt;.  The guide ranks PC and mobile
companies on their chemical andwaste policies and practices. HP was
third but has slipped to sixthposition, with 4.7 out of 10, down
from 5.7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poison Apples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has recently launched its new range of MacBooks, but what
youalso get with a new MacBook is the highest level of another type
oftoxic flame retardant, tetrabromobisphenol A. &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/materials/"&gt;Apple claims&lt;/a&gt;
it islooking for alternatives but for now it appears to be using
far more of thistoxic chemical than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Brigden, of the Greenpeace Science Unit, was alarmedby
the results: "During the sampling process it was remarkable to
notethat, whether Mac or PC, once you by-pass the sleek and cool
design ofthese computers, hazardous substances are a component
common to all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/recycling-of-electronic-waste/"&gt;
Greenpeace research&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the same toxic
chemicalsfound in these tests are polluting electronic waste
(e-waste) scrapyards in China and India. These yards are often the
final pollutedresting place of computers thrown away in other
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brigden visited these yards to take samples in 2005:
"BFRs,especially PDBEs, were widespread in the recycling yards
andsurrounding environment in China and India where electronics
componentsare being scrapped. Lead was also found in many
locations, often atvery high levels."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because none of the large electronics players have a
comprehensivetake-back policy for their old products many old
computers end up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/"&gt;
dumped inAsia&lt;/a&gt; and recycled by hand in appalling conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronics is a fast moving, innovative industry that can
respondquickly to users' wishes and new trends. It's high time it
moved quicklyto make greener, longer-lasting products to help
reverse the growingtrend in toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

            A large purse seiner comes dangerously close alongside the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="#update"&gt;Jump to update.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SinceMay, the Rainbow Warrior has been documenting the state of
theMediterranean Sea, including the activities of Spanish,
French,Italian, Turkish and Japanese bluefin tuna
fishingvessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found is overfishing on a massivescale, and an industry
that routinely ignores quotas and regulations.An estimated 45,000
tons of tuna was taken from the Mediterranean lastyear - while the
legal quota is only 32,000 tons.  French,Libyan and Turkish tuna
fisherman all stand accused of illegallyfishing over their quotas,
and some French fisherman have even admittedas much to the media.
No wonder the bluefin tuna stock here is in sucha dire state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stephan Beaucher ofGreenpeace France put it, "Leading
scientists and environmental groupsagree that the blue fin tuna
stock is on the verge of collapse in theMediterranean as a result
of over fishing." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The confrontation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becausegovernments and industry won't tackle the issue, we were
taking ourmessage direct to the people of France.  But the
government ofMarseille and the tuna industry don't want our message
heard, and aredoing everything they can to keep us from even coming
intoport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on June 27th, we were granted permissionto dock in
Marseille, but this week that permission was revoked for"technical
and security reasons" (with no furtherexplanation).  As the Rainbow
Warrior approached the port,over 20 industrial fishing vessels
surrounded it.  Our shipdropped anchor about a mile out. Now, we're
ferrying journalists out byboat to talk to them about the sorry
state of the bluefin tuna stock,and the need for marine reserves in
theMediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These fisherman may have dirtysecrets to hide," said Karli
Thomas by phone from the deck of theRainbow Warrior, "But they
won't let them stop us from bringing theplight of the tuna to
light."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="update" href="#" name="update"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE (day 2):  Rainbow Warrior boarded andtowed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25520/industrial-tuna-fishing-ships.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followingan additional confrontation this morning where tuna
fishermen blockadedand boarded the Rainbow Warrior as well as fire
hosing its crew; ourship is now being towed out of France's 12 mile
territorial zone by theFrench authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tuna fishermen are out ofcontrol on the high seas and now
they are out of control in port," saidKarli Thomas, on board the
Rainbow Warrior. "These industrial tunafishermen blockading us need
to take responsibility for their part inthe depleted state of the
Mediterranean tuna fishery and look at thebigger picture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Rainbow Warrior has broken nolaws and the source of the
tension is coming from the French tunafisherman," said Mike Finken,
captain of the Rainbow Warrior. "TheRainbow Warrior is capable of
leaving under its own propulsion and aswe made clear yesterday it
had planned to do so at 6pm today to setsail for Spain to continue
Greenpeace's campaign to raise awareness ofthe threats facing the
Mediterranean Sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomascontinued, "They should support our call for establishment
of a networkof marine reserves to bring about a sustainable,
healthy and productiveMediterranean Sea. It is in the long term
interests of the environmentand all fishing communities, both in
France and the rest of theMediterranean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rainbow Warrior crew weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/defendingourmediterranean/"&gt;Updates from the crew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In French&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/france/news/marseille-le-point-a-8h30"&gt;Updates to the story in French.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Swimming in chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/toxicpollutioneels111/</url><text>
	The European eel - not an everyday topic of conversation. But our investigations have revealed that the humble eel is contaminated with toxic chemicals. Adding insult to injury, the eel is already vanishing from lakes and rivers across Europe, and some of these toxic chemicals look as if they might last longer than the species itself.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/europeaneelpollution.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The European Eel. Stocks in Europe have crashed due to a combination of overfishing, habitat loss and toxic pollution. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do toxic chemicals with complicated names like brominated
flameretardants (BFRs) that are added to many textiles, sofas,
plastics,TV's and computers end up in eels? Politicians tell us
that chemicalsare under control, but tell that to an eel who is
swimming inchemicals. Toxic chemicals are out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this contamination a problem for eels? No one knows for sure
but theevidence is mounting that BFRs and other toxics have the
potential todamage development and hormone systems in humans and
wildlife.Certainly for an eel already under pressure, it's an extra
dose of bad news.Some scientists are concerned that these toxins
could harm the eel'sability reproduce or its young to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With populations in some European waters as low as 1 percent
ofhistoric levels, the eel clearly doesn't need a toxic burden. For
thatmatter neither do we. BFRs can also contaminate our own
blood,including umbilical cord blood, exposing an unborn baby to
manmadehazardous chemicals while still in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical contamination? No Thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/10/virtual-gallery-banner.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;We need your help to counter dirty industry lobbying against laws to protect you from toxic pollution. Take a stand by &lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;uploading your picture&lt;/a&gt; at the vote for safer chemicals site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe a new law (called REACH) is being drafted that
attempts toprotect human health and the environment from the toxic
contamination.REACH would provide health and safety information
currently lacking forsome 30,000 chemicals. A strong REACH would
drive the replacement orsubstitution of toxic chemicals with safer
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while eels might be slippery and tricky to control they
havenothing on the worst excesses of the chemical industry. The
vitalproposed law has inspired the biggest industrial
lobbyingassault ever seen in Europe. The chemical industry is
seeking to weakenit to the benefit of industry and loss of
protection for you and me.Chemical industry associations from
Europe, US and Asia have sentarmies of lobbyists to Brussels,
spreading baseless scare stories andemploying delay tactics with
any politician would listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Don't worry - we'll just test a few"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some EU politicians and governments are now pushing the industry
line,wrongly claiming the law will cost jobs and must be
"streamlined," mademore "cost effective" and "workable." These are
industry weasel wordsfor the seriously weakening the law to
everyone else. They proposeallowing industry to continue using
20,000 chemicals without basichealth, safety and environmental data
information - that's 2/3 of thechemicals originally under the
law!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the chemical industry and certain politicians prefer
toignore past experiences with toxic chemicals. Here again the eel
cangive them a little lesson - in history. Many eels tested had
highlevels of highly toxic PCB's - despite the fact they have been
bannedsince the 1970's in Europe. Past mistakes in chemical
regulationare not quickly resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Protecting people or pandering to profit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The politicians of the European Union have a unique opportunity
toeffective regulate chemical pollution and set a strong
worldwideprecedent to protect human health and the environment.
Will they standup for the people who elected them or will they cave
to in to vestedinterests of the non-elected chemical industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action against toxic pollution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org.uk/"&gt;We need your voice for safer chemicals to show politicians the need to put the public before dirty industry profits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=167_105"&gt;Help our work for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	"How often does one walk into one of these things and come out at the end of it at 6 in the morning with just about everything you asked for coming in? Not very often."  That was Greenpeace climate campaigner Steve Sawyer's reaction at the end of the Climate summit in Montreal.

            Global warming: greather threat than terrorism
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Kyoto Protocol is stronger today than it was two weeks ago.
Thishistoric first Meeting of the Parties has acknowledged the
urgency ofthe threat that climate change poses to the world's
poorest people, andeventually, to all of us. The decisions made
here have cleared the wayfor long term action," said Bill Hare,
Greenpeace International ClimatePolicy Advisor in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting agreed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--To start urgent negotiations on a new round of emission
reductiontargets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto
Protocol(2013-2017). A special group has been established to ensure
that thesenegotiations are concluded "as soon as possible". This is
necessary toensure the continuity of carbon markets, and to allow
governments toput policies and measures in place to ensure that the
new, deeperemission reduction targets are met&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--To start now to review and improve the Kyoto Protocol.
Mandated underthe existing treaty, this review will formally begin
at next year'smeeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--A Five Year Plan of Action on Adaptation, to assist least
developedcountries to cope with the impacts of climate change. This
programmewill begin to address the fact that climate change already
impacts theworld's poorest, and that it will get much worse in the
coming decades.It is the ethical, political, and legal
responsibility of theindustrialised countries to provide for
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, the Bush administration attempted to derail the
process,at one point even walking out of the negotiations, but the
rest of theworld showed a resolve to move ahead regardless. For
once, the Bushadministration was forced back to the table and into
agreement with theinternational community. No doubt the
overwhelming presence of U.S.civil society at these talks has had a
positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has continued to attempt to lure countries away from the
UNmultilateral climate regime with its international emission
trading toan ineffective approach based on voluntary actions and
'partnerships'.Today, however, governments have agreed to hold
substantive talksbeginning in May 2006 on the Kyoto Protocol's
second commitment period,sending an unmistakable signal that we are
on the road to new and moreambitious targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Sawyer, "What will be remembered is that this was
themoment when the future of the Kyoto Protocol and legally
bindingemissions reductions and the cap and trade system
wassecured...Australia and the US are isolated as never before, and
theoverwhelming presence of US state governments, cities, trade
unions,businesses, churches, youth and many other parts of civil
society gavethe rest of the world confidence that Americans do care
about climatechange, and that the Bush administration's
intransigence will soonerrather than later be remembered as an
unfortunate historical footnote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the Energy Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;Sign up for information about how you can help stop dangerous climate change together with Greenpeace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/supportus"&gt;Help keep us in action around the world --from smokestacks to meeting rooms -- to stop dangerous climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Rainbow Warrior under sail.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our ship Rainbow Warrior was in the Philippines, documenting
thepotential impacts of global warming on coral reefs in a World
Heritagesite.  We were operating with a government chart which
claimed tobe up to date, but showed us to be 1.5 miles away from
the reef we hitaround 7am local time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This incident is very regrettable.  Within minutes after
ithappened, we called up the marine park ranger station to inform
themabout the accident," said Red Constantino of Greenpeace
Southeast Asia.Marine park rangers, assisted by Greenpeace,
immediately conducted anassessment of the damaged reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park officials' final assessment of damage covered a total
area of 32 meters by 3 meters (105 x 10 feet) of the reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine was set at 384,000 pesos (US$6,857).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This accident could have been avoided if the chart was
accurate. We feel responsible, however, and this amount will be
transferred onWednesday 2 November," said Constantino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grounding did not cause any major damage to the ship nor
serious delays to the ship's expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate the work that Greenpeace continues to do for
theenvironment.  We also appreciate the immediate action they took
toget the full assessment of the damage," said Tubbataha Park
ManagerAngelique Songco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Tubbataha Protected Area Management board
bothagreed there is a serious need of updated maps and precise
maritimecharts of the Tubbataha Reefs to avoid similar
accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition to the Tubbataha Reefs is part of the global
effort ofGreenpeace to document what is at stake should global
warming worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is on the "Asia Energy Revolution Tour"
ofAustralia, China, Philippines and Thailand to call for an urgent
breakfrom coal and to promote a massive shift to clean, renewable
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

	The biggest names in electronics have just sat their first global exam on their green credentials. Ranked on their use of toxic chemicals and electronic waste (e-waste) policies only Dell and Nokia scraped a barely respectable score while Apple, Motorola and Lenovo flunked the test to finish bottom of the class.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scorecard highlights which of the major electronics companies isdoing the most to remove the worst toxic chemicals from their productsand which companies have good recycling programs for their products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/8/green-electronics-guide.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Click here for the ranking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranking is important because the amounts of toxic e-waste isgrowing everyday and it often ends up dumped in the developing world.Reducing the toxic chemicals in products reduces pollution from oldproducts and makes recycling safer, easier and cheaper. Companies withgood recycling schemes help ensure that their products don't end up inthe e-waste yards of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The scorecard will provide a dynamic tool to green the electronicssector by setting off a race to the top. By taking back their discardedproducts, companies will have incentives to eliminate harmfulsubstances used in their products, since this is the only way they canensure safe reuse and recycling of electronic waste," said Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nokia-rank/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-dell-ranki/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt; share the top spot in the ranking. They believe that asproducers they should bear individual responsibility for taking backand reusing or recycling their own-brand discarded products. Nokialeads the way on eliminating toxic chemicals, since the end of 2005 allnew models of mobiles are free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and all newcomponents to be free of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from thestart of 2007.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Matti Wuori, founder of Greenpeace Finland and the former Board Chair of Greenpeace International from 1991 - 1993. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matti was a Renaissance man who could read 13 languages and was
asarticulate about art, literature, and music as he was outspoken
abouthuman rights and environmentalism.  He believed passionately
inthe importance of non-governmental organisations (NGO's) as a
foil tocorporations and governments in civil society, and he served
as anadviser or board member to more than a dozen of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti Wuori was a strong, visionary voice within civil society
groupsin Europe. He worked tirelessly to protect the environment
and humanrights, as well as strengthen the position of
non-governmentalorganisations in society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wuori was a 'global citizen' in the true meaning of the word.
He didnot hesitate to criticise polluting governments and companies
whoviolate legal and ethical environmental guidelines" said
ExecutiveDirector, Lennart Daleus at Greenpeace Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti's work at Greenpeace was not complete. This autumn he was
set tolead a fact-finding mission on the violation of international
law inlogging operations in the indigenous Sámi homeland in
Northern Finland.Wuori was committed to represent the Sámi reindeer
herders at theEuropean Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I remember well how Matti reminded NGO activists in Brussels
that thecore business of any NGO should be to pose nasty questions
todecision-makers. Matti wanted non-governmental organisations to
work aswatch dogs and alarm clocks in society. He often reminded us
about thedangers of becoming marionettes for governments or
companies. Wepromise to live up to his expectations and carry on
his impressivework" said Campaign Director, Mads Christensen at
Greenpeace Nordic inHelsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Matti was chairman of Greenpeace International from 1991 to
1993. Anincredibly talented environmental and human rights
campaigner, Mattiplayed a series of very significant roles here at
Greenpeace. Hisenergy and commitment will be greatly missed" said
Jeanne Moffat, BoardMember of Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti  was also a board member of Greenpeace in the Czech
republicand Hungary until his death. In addition to his work
atGreenpeace,  Matti was a prominent Finnish lawyer and
formerMember of the EuropeanParliament. He also worked as an
adviser to the South African Truth andReconciliation Commission
from 1996 until 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rich and varied lifetime, Matti was called upon to
giveexpert testimony in spotting fraudulent artwork, acted in a
featurefilm (in which he played, not surprisingly, a Finnish
lawyer), servedon the board of the Avanti! chamber orchestra, wrote
two books andlectured on human rights, democracy, and
constitutional law. He wasalso known to dance an inimitable
jitterbug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matti succumbed to a long battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He was that rarest of combinations: a scholar and an
activist. He'd looked human civilization hard in the eye, saw it
for what it was,and set about the task of redressing its ills,
while never losing sightof its beauty," said Greenpeace
International Board Chair Anne Summers.&lt;/p&gt;

	The European Union voted today to ignore its own Environment Committee's recommendations to tightly regulate global-warming gases. It was a victory for multinational profits, and a defeat for the children being born today who'll inherit a warmer, more dangerous world.

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/greenfreeze-production-line-in.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/greenfreeze-production-line-in.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenfreeze: the ozone and climate-friendly solution for home refrigeration. Industry said it wouldn't work, was too costly, and would never find a market. Until we proved them wrong.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate in the European Parliament today was ostensibly
aboutregulating a class of chemicals, fluorinated greenhouse gases,
known asF-gases.  But it was really a battle between the interests
of amultimillion dollar industry and the future of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Parliament at the plenary session in Strasbourg
rejected a proposal to replace hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs (a
fluorinated gas 1,300 times stronger than carbon dioxide), in
household refrigerators, even though the EU market is already
dominated by the climate-friendly alternative
Greenfreezetechnology.  They rejected other strong measures
recommended bytheir own environment committee and instead approved
only the weakestprovisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;F-gas: the cure that's as bad as the
disease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-gases are used in many appliances such as refrigerators,
airconditioning, foam blowers and car tyres. They replaced
ozone-depletinggases such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), which are
being phased outglobally as part of the 1990 Montreal Protocol.
F-gases likehydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) are thus often portrayed by
theirmanufacturers as 'environmentally friendly'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, whilethey were introduced to address the problem of the
hole in the Earth'sprotective ozone layer -- discovered in 1985
--they were introducedbefore scientists became worried about
dangerous climate change, andwere subsequently discovered to be
highly potent &lt;a href="~/link/b3e54473a31649a7b6183fc0cbf23b22.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;
greenhouse gases.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most appliances, natural alternatives to F-gases are either
alreadyavailable and widely used, or are in development. For
example,Greenpeace and German company DKK Scharfenstein introduced
&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/solar_chill/"&gt;
"Greenfreeze" hydrocarbon refrigerators&lt;/a&gt; into the European
market in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="width: 200px;" class="inlinebox"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Greenpeacebegan research on Greenfreeze (hydrocarbon) refrigeration technology toreduce the destruction of the ozone layer. It is now a highlysuccessful example of a green organisation and industry workingtogether..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ==UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking at the launch of the Sustainable Development Commission (October 2000).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todayfridges made by major European companies such as Siemens
and Bosch arenearly all F-gas free. Big food corporations are
switching to F-gasfree commercial refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But American manufacturerscontinue to expand their use of
F-gases, and they're looking for newforeign markets, despite the
documented dangers of these chemicals forour planet's climate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also hold a sizeable market sharein Europe, and have not
been idle in trying to ensure that profits, notthe planet, are
primary on the EU agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The counterforce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" style="margin: 4px;" src="/international/PageFiles/25633/mahi-sideridou-she-doesn-t-al.jpg"&gt;
Enter Mahi Sideridou, one of the secret weapons in the
Greenpeacearsenal. You won't have seen pictures of her handcuffed
to an anchorchain or hanging a banner from a smokestack. As a
Greenpeace climateand energy policy advisor stationed in Brussels,
she's more likely tobe decked out in a smart suit than a wetsuit,
working the corridors ofthe European Parliament. And if it weren't
for her nearly lonepresence, the industry would be the only point
of view that EuropeanMinisters would hear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I'm totally outnumbered here" she saidin a recent phone
interview. "There are dozens of industry lobbyistsyammering on
about how these climate-killing chemicals are 'a part ofthe social
fabric of Europe' and suggesting that banning them will
meandisaster for European industry. When I tell parliamentarians
that thehome refrigeration market has already demonstrated that
alternativesare available and commercially proven, it's often the
first they'veheard that alternatives even exist."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because she works forGreenpeace, Mahi has found herself excluded
from the back-roomdiscussions that industry flacks like to have
with parliamentarians inprivate. But despite the smart suit, Mahi
is Greenpeace: getting into aclosed door meeting --like getting
into the grounds of a nuclear powerplant -- just takes a bit of
determination and inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I found out about a closed lunch session that was being held
the dayof a debate between Parliamentarians on F-gases. Industry
was going totell key parliamentarians why they should water down
legislation thatwe thought was weak already. I called the German
Liberal partyrepresentative who was hosting it and asked if I could
be included togive a balanced view. He replied that there was no
room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I said I was a very small person, but he didn't seem to get the
joke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I called the UK Liberal representative and asked him if he'd
knownabout the meeting, as the issue was technically his area
ofresponsibility. He invited me to come along as his guest. This
didn'tgo down very well at the door, and they insisted there was
only a placefor one. The British MEP graciously excused himself and
instructed thatI be given his chair. Had I not been there, nobody
would havechallenged the "facts" according to Hill and Knowlton,
the industry'sPR company, which turned out to be running the
lunch."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard work and hard information led the EU environment committee
topropose extremely aggressive controls on the F-gas industry.
Butall that fell victim today to a well-funded industry
assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Why would a PR company be lobbying the
EU?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most vocal lobby on the F-gas regulation has undoubtedly
come fromthe F-gas producers themselves. But they generally do so
in disguise.If you, as a parliamentarian, were asked to take a
meeting with the'European Partnership for Energy and the
Environment' to hear theirviews on F-gas regulation, you'd probably
expect to be meeting withenvironmentalists. From Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'd be wrong on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's actually an industry front group, made up largely of
American andJapanese multinationals with plants in Europe, who are
lobbying againstregulation of F-gases out of cost concerns. And
while their &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.epeeglobal.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;makes a flashy show of
how their chemicals don't destroy the ozone(which is true) they
fail to mention that they're contributing toglobal warming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's exactly the kind of economy with thetruth you could expect
from a smarmy PR agency. In this case, Hill&amp;amp; Knowlton is
painting DuPont and other f-gas manufacturers inearth-friendly
shades of green for their wonderful ozone-friendlychemicals. 
Ironically, Hill &amp;amp; Knowlton is exactly the samecompany which,
in 1975, trotted out reports and scientists claimingthat the Ozone
hole was a myth, environmentalists were scare-mongering,and
industry shouldn't be required to take costly and unnecessary
action to ban CFCs.  They now make flashanimations which pat
themselves on the back for not making the ozonehole any bigger than
the 8 times larger than Europe that it already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Democracy: on sale now at prices any
multinational can afford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current EU legislation, lobby groups such as the
EuropeanPartnership for Energy and the Environment are not required
to revealtheir funding sources. Unless MEPs do some digging, or
Greenpeace orClimate Action Network tells them, decision-makers
might never knowthat the same multinationals which are making money
off pollutingchemicals are the ones asking them not to regulate
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as Sideridou points out, that's not the only place where
democracy fails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Whilethe parliamentary discussions and votes are open and
transparent, thediscussions of the environment ministers are
closed. So we have todepend on leaks to find out what's happening
behind those closed doors."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the environment committee of the European Parliament
recentlyendorsed the tough legislation which went to the full
Parliament, theindustry responded with a detailed action plan. It
instructs theirlobbyists to "raise safety issues," "call to
question the committee'scompetency," "find friends who can put
doubt on results...and carry themessage to wider parliament." What
are friends for?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,industry's friends succeeded in weakening what
would have been a goodstep toward addressing global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why does anyone vote against phasing out a harmful,
man-madegreenhouse gas if alternatives are commercially available
and alreadyon the market? The companies that produce fluorinated
gases have arguedthat life as we know it would come to a halt if
these chemicals weregradually replaced. This couldn't befurther
from the truth. The European Parliament has today failed in itsduty
to act inthe interests of the public and the environment," said
Sideridou.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while she found today's vote particularly depressing, she's
not quitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I've taken this very, very personally. A year ago I thought
aboutgiving up --wondering what the point of banging my head
against thewall might be. But the motivation for staying is that if
you leave theother side wins. And when you're right, you just can't
let the otherside win."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nobel Peace Prize, founded on a fortune made from explosives, has gone to the agency whose job it is to promote nuclear power without promoting nuclear weapons, and the man who heads it. Anybody with that job probably deserves some kind of prize.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Littering the planet with nuclear power plants won't put a lid on nuclear weapons.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed ElBaradei is the head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency(IAEA), both winners of this year's Nobel Peace
Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency is tasked with policing the spread of nuclearweapons
at the same time it is charged with promoting the verytechnologies
and materials used to make nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a job worthy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In opposing the Iraq war and championing a nuclear-free Middle
East,ElBaradei has in recent years been a voice of sanity in the
world ofnuclear non-proliferation. Here's what he had to say
aboutnuclear weapons in The Economist in October 2003:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. I worry about nuclear
weapons falling intothe hands of terrorists or ruthless dictators.
I worry about nuclearweapons already in the arsenals of democracies
- because as long asthese weapons exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft,
sabotage or accidental launch,and even democracies are not immune
to radical shifts in their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.
I worry, but I also hope. Ihope that a side-effect of globalisation
will be an enduringrealisation that there is only one human race,
to which we allbelong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoken like a Peace Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Mr. Hyde side of his job is to be the UN's front man for
thenuclear industry, peddling more nuclear power to more countries.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, Mr. ElBaradei, is the part of your job that worries us. 
You see, we worry that, in our collective memories, the horrors of
Hiroshima andNagasaki have begun to fade. We worry about nuclear
materialsfalling into the hands of terrorists or ruthless
dictators. We worryabout nuclear materials that are already in
nuclear power plants andreprocessing plants and storage facilities.
Because as long asthese materials exist, there is no absolute
guarantee against thedisastrous consequences of their theft or
sabotage, and evendemocracies are not immune to radical shifts in
their securityanxieties and nuclear policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this award will spark a new discussion around
thefundamental contradiction of the International Atomic Energy
Agency'sdual role as nuclear policeman and nuclear salesman. Only
once thatduality is removed can the IAEA truly focus on the
pressing threat ofthe global spread of nuclear weapons technology,
both civil andmilitary.&lt;/p&gt;

	After Katrina, Rita, and Stan, Hurricane Wilma has left another trail of devastation through the Caribbean, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Western Cuba and Florida.

            Man braves flood waters in his destroyed village during the aftermath of Hurricane Stan. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands left homeless by extensive flooding in Mexico.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico and Florida were hardest hit by Wilma. Mexico has just
suffered extensiveflooding, landslides and loss of life due to
Hurricane Stan. OnWednesday 19 Oct, Wilma was measured as the
strongest hurricane everyrecorded. The 2005 North Atlantic
hurricane season has been one of themost intense since records
began in 1851. Only 1969 had as manyhurricanes as this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Out of names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the body responsible for naming hurricanes will have
tostart with the Greek alphabet if there is a new hurricane this
season,having run out of suitable letters in the alphabet to name
hurricanesin 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unparalleled destruction due to hurricanes and the Amazon
Rainforestsuffering &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/slideshows/amazondroughtbrazil"&gt;
severe drought&lt;/a&gt; might be providing a little peek into ourfuture
shaped by global warming. A warmer world will experience manymore
extreme weather events like droughts, storms and floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change,hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming more intense
and moredamaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of
globalwarming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans
startedheating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by
whilehurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet, gather
strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hurricanes and droughts hit the headlines and thousands of
peoplelose their lives there is strangely little news about the
urgentinternational action required to tackle global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global gamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could wait with our fingers crossed, hoping the worst of
thepredictions don't come true, although with every passing week,
eventsand the evidence stack up to suggest it's the worst possible
option forthe planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions are here - clean renewable energy and energy
efficiencymeasures can be implemented now and this must be better
than taking agamble with the planet - as the last few weeks have
shown we wouldcertainly lose that gamble, big time.&lt;/p&gt;

	For centuries fortune seekers have plundered the huge rainforest of the Congo basin in the heart of Africa, the second-largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon. Ivory, diamonds and gold have been taken and shipped to the centres of old empires and now finally, the forest itself is being torn down and sent on the same journey.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/stop-illegal-logging" class="act"&gt;TAKE ACTION:  Demand Mandatory Laws on Illegal
Timber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) declared a moratorium on new loggingconcessions in an attempt
to halt the widespread destruction. It didn'twork, in part due to
corruption and the continued flood of illegaltimber flowing into
consumer countries because there are still no lawsprohibiting their
importation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the trade in illegal timber does little to
reduce thepoverty in producer countries. The World Bank estimates
that illegallogging costs timber-producing countries between US$10
and15 billion ayear in lost revenue with this money only fuelling
the profit marginsof logging companies and their local allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legality of current logging to be examined&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the President of the DRC, Joseph Kabila signed a
decree thatupholds the 2002 moratorium, freezing new logging
concessions in up to40 million hectares of rainforest while the
legality of all currentlogging concessions are examined. Without
international assistance toremove corrupt and illegal logging
companies from the Congoleseforestry sector and laws prohibiting
the importation of illegal timberinto consumer countries however,
this decree might not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer countries of Europe, Japan and the US have been
slow tocreate the laws that would support the efforts of producer
countrieslike the DRC. As they wash their hands of any
responsibility as thepurchasers of the illegal timber, the last
ancient forests in Africaare wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Until now, the logging industry has been a law unto itself,
destroyingthe rainforest to supply wood to Europe, Asia and the
USA. This decreeis an important first step towards responsible and
socially just forestmanagement, but this will only be achieved in
this post-conflictcountry with assistance from the international
community," said FilipVerbelen, Greenpeace International forest
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Illegal timber flowing freely into consumer countries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id=" 49438" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last month, we have highlighted the ease at which illegal
anddestructively logged timber enters the consumer countries. In &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/action-on-illegal-logging-ital/"&gt;
Italy&lt;/a&gt; itwas illegal timber from Africa being unloaded in the
port of Livorno.&lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/museum-built-from-amazon-destr/"&gt;
Spain&lt;/a&gt; had illegal timber from the Amazon in its prized Queen
SofiaMuseum and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/importing-forest-destruction-222/"&gt;
UK&lt;/a&gt; was caught red-handed with plywood made from illegaltimber
from the Paradise forests of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again the answer to halting the destruction of the
lastancient forests has been clear. Laws prohibiting the
importation ofillegal and destructively logged timber into consumer
countries are thefirst step to stemming the tide of destruction in
the last of ourancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DRC is trying to halt the destruction and protect its
forests andthe people and wildlife that depend on them. It is time
for Europe,Japan and the US to follow the lead and enact laws to
help protect thelast ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action to stop illegal timber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/stop-illegal-logging"&gt;Louis Michel believes measures to stop the importation of illegal timber into Europe should be voluntary, let him know that it is mandatory!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us in our work to save the forests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=164_204"&gt;Become part of the solution and protect the last of our ancient forests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activists dump over a tonne of plywood secured with large chains blocking the entrance to DEFRA, the UK Government's department responsible for the environment. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon lost an area roughly the size of Belgium last year,
and theParadise Forests of South East Asia are disappearing so
rapidly, thattheir most famous residents, orang-utans, are facing
extinction in thewild within the next decade. The African Forests
of the Great Apes issimilarly facing a huge assault. Why? Illegal
and destructive logging,driven by demand for cheap wood from
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, in the port city of Livorno, Italy, we &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/action-on-illegal-logging-ital/"&gt;
blocked&lt;/a&gt; the unloadingof the freighter '&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/simillegalcameroon.pdf"&gt;
Guan He Kou&lt;/a&gt;' which was carrying timber from a companyinvolved
in illegal logging in the Congo Basin. The presence of the'Guan He
Kou' and its rainforest cargo in Europe shows just how easy itis to
steal from some of the most biologically rich areas in the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activists were arrested, the ship continued to deliver
thetimber before sailing to Spain, where we greeted it again in the
portof Valencia on Monday. No inspections, no seizure of the stolen
goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies that log the tropical timber are known to
beinvolved in criminal activities. In Papua New Guinea, for
example, thelogging industry is dominated by Malaysian logging
giant &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25635/RH_Forest_Report.pdf"&gt;
RimbunanHijau&lt;/a&gt;, a company that has been directly linked not only
toenvironmental destruction, but also to human rights abuses
includingtorture and rape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in the UK, activists &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2005/criminal-rainforest-timber-tra/"&gt;
blockaded&lt;/a&gt; the offices of the environmentdepartment in protest
at the lack of action to prohibit the importationof illegal
timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="223231" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments around the world have known about thisproblem for
years and they've done absolutely nothing about it.Illegally logged
timber products from the world's last rainforests aresold openly
around the world. This criminal trade must be
prohibitedimmediately," said Phil Aikman, Greenpeace International
forestscampaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's (EC) response to the issue of illegal
logginghas so far been weak. It is promoting voluntary measures,
despite callsfrom 180 NGOs, the European Parliament and 70
companies (including Ikeaand B&amp;amp;Q), who have all called for
legislation which stops theimport of illegally sourced timber
products into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This voluntary approach is an inadequate and untenable position,
notjust for consumers in Europe who are unknowingly complicit in
forestcrimes, but also for the people of timber-producing
countries. TheWorld Bank estimates that illegal logging costs
timber-producingcountries between US$10 and15 billion a year in
lost revenue. Forestdwelling people in countries like Cameroon,
Papua New Guinea and Brazilcannot afford to have their livelihoods
stolen from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps in protecting the ancient forest is the
introduction of laws prohibiting the import of illegal timber.While
the European Commission drags its feet, the forests continue tobe
destroyed and the people that depend on them for their way of
lifecontinue to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

While competitors like Sony Ericssonand Nokia are living up to their commitments to remove toxic chemicals,Motorola is not answering the call to clean up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are chemicals in products important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many chemicals found in everyday products are now common
environmentalpollutants and are found in animals and humans. Almost
everyone hasdozens of man-made chemicals in their body; the effects
of thesechemical cocktails on our health are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these voluntary company measures are good news, other
companieswill never change unless the law forces them to. Only then
will thesetoxic chemicals be fully phased out and substituted with
saferalternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about those laws?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current regulation of chemicals is weak and inadequate. Toxic
chemicalsare found from the Arctic to the Alps. The European Union
(EU) isdrafting new chemical law that would set a world standard,
but to beeffective the new law must identify all hazardous
chemicals and requiretheir substitution with safer
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chemical contamination? No Thanks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While better chemical regulation should be welcomed by all, it
is underattack from predictable quarters. The chemical industry has
beenscare-mongering with exaggerated claims of job losses and
decliningprofits.It has also recruited dirty industry's best
friend, the BushAdministration, to threaten the EU with a World
Trade Organisationlawsuit if it dares to try and cut toxic
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to counter inaccurate industry lobbying is to have
othercompanies demonstrate that they can do without toxic
chemicals. It remains to beseen if European members of parliament
will side with the people andprogressive companies by voting for
strong chemical law. Or will theyprefer the lobbying and
scare-mongering of dirty industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take a stand for safer chemicals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chemicalreaction.org/"&gt;We need your voice for safer chemicals to show politicians the need to put the public before dirty industry profits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=167_101"&gt;Help our work for a toxic free future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Italy is a long way from the giant ancient Boreal forest that stretches across Canada. Despite the distance that separates them however, people buying Kimberly-Clark products in Italy and many other European countries are inadvertently helping to destroy one of the planets last great forests. 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

            Clearcut Boreal forest in Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably haven't heard of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation but they certainly know their products. As the world's largest tissue product manufacturer it makes some of the most well known brands like Kleenex, Andrex, Scottex, Page and Hakle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://write-a-letter.greenpeace.org/130" target="_blank"&gt;Take Action now to save Canada's Boreal Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/news/features/kc-response/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Response to Kimberly-Clark's Claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these products contain fibre sourced from the ancient forests of Canada, which is why activists visited the Kimberly-Clark regional headquarters in Turin, Italy recently to demand an end to the destruction of the Boreal forests for disposable tissue products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greencenter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Following on from the protest at the company's headquarters in Turin, Italy, two activists locked their arms onto an old bus outfitted to look like a giant tissue box, and block the entrance to Kimberly-Clark's largest pulp mill in North America. The protest is the latest in Greenpeace's campaign to highlight Kimberly-Clark's irresponsible logging practices and continuing deception about these practices to consumers and investors alike. &lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/kimberly-clark-it-s-time-we-t" target="_blank"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the cuddly and soft image of Kimberly-Clark's products lies a manufacturing behemoth. In 2005 alone, Kimberly-Clark used 3.1 million metric tonnes of virgin fibre to make its products, equivalent to 135,000 truckloads. 28 percent of virgin pulp used for its products in Europe and more than 20 percent globally was sourced from ancient forests in Canada including the threatened Boreal forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such huge quantities of tree fibre aren't just a product of being a huge company; it's also due to the fact that Kimberly-Clark trails behind much of the industry in the use of recycled fibre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Cascades, North America's fourth largest tissue paper manufacturer, which uses 97 percent recycled material for its tissue products; Kimberly-Clark is well behind the pack with only 29 percent of its pulp coming from recycled sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Kimberly-Clark's best-known brands do not even contain a single strand of recycled fibre, a sad fact that is often proudly displayed on the packaging with the boast of '100 percent Virgin Fibre'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ninety percent of the logging that occurs in Canada's Boreal forest is clear-cutting, wiping out vast tracts of ancient forests to make disposable products. How can Kimberly- Clark possibly justify its support of this destruction, especially since environment-friendly alternatives exist?" asked Sergio Baffoni, Greenpeace forests campaigner from Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark could help solve the crisis in the world's ancient forests by increasing the use of recycled fibre in their entire line of products, and only purchase virgin fibre from logging operations that are sustainable and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™. So far, they have chosen to hide from their responsibility rather than address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, Canada's Boreal forest represents over 25 percent of the world's remaining intact ancient forests. This huge forest is also one of the world's largest storehouses of carbon. Every tree cut from the forest increases the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and helps to fuel climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            Sydney voters call for clean renewable energy during the 'walk against warming'. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people joined the global day of climate action on
Nov 4 todemand decisive steps to combat the biggest threat to the
planet.  Here'sa quick snapshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Australia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/photo-stories/climate-change/walk-against-warming-2006"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25498/walk-against-warming-saturday.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge crowds of more than 80,000 joined the 2006 Walk Against
Warmingaround Australia. From Melbourne to Maitland, Canberra to
Cairns, andeverywhere in between, voters with one voice urged the
Howardgovernment to take action against climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/walkagainstwarming/show/"&gt;More

&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25498/_mg_3712_climate_change_cos.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25,000 people packed into London's Trafalgar Square. We were
gatheredto make a call for action on climate change - everyone from
the Women'sInstitute to the rock band Razorlight. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/icount/show/"&gt;More images

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop Global Warming message formed to issue a call to action
forFlorida congressional candidates to take immediate steps
todramatically reduce global warming pollution and protect Florida
fromclimate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global protests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gallery.globalclimatecampaign.org/n4global"&gt;Protests
large and small&lt;/a&gt; took place across the globe from Sofia
toSydney. Activism has been brought new urgency by the release in
the UK of the &lt;a href="http://hm-treasury.gov.uk./independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm"&gt;
Stern Report&lt;/a&gt;,the review by British economist and government
advisor Sir NicholasStern which calls climate change "the greatest
and widest-rangingmarketfailure ever seen," and calculates the cost
of action now to reducecarbon as being a fraction of what the cost
of inaction will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Future generations will not forgive us if we delay"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But will governments listen to the unified voices of the
people,scientists, and economists all over the world?  According to
SteveSawyer, ourClimate &amp;amp; Energy Policy Advisor:  "The
legal,moral, and political obligations of the rich countries are
clear: theymust dramatically reduce their emissions and at the same
time beprepared to provide massive support to help the poorest
countries adaptto the climate change that we are already committed
to."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Only the next two weeks will show if there is real global politicalwill to tackle climate change or if politicians again choose to talkinstead of act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=Signupclimateactionday"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine for online and offline actions you can take to help stop global warming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Donateclimateactionday"&gt;Greenpeace depends on your contributions.

	In a report just published, the International Energy Agency  promotes nuclear power as the solution which will save us from global warming. But who will save us from nuclear power?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/nuclearcrack.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/10/nuclearcrack.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint a symbolic crack on dome at the Tihange Nuclear Plant in Belgium. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) was set up as a Western
counterpart to OPEC, with the aim of "controlling and regulating
the oil stocks" of its developed-country membership. The IEA's
approach to energy has lacked imagination for as long as it has
existed and its analysis perpetuates antiquated thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in nuclear power is a sure way to lose the battle
against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same carbon savings, nuclear power costs up to ten times
as much as energy efficiency measures. It creates huge security and
environmental threats that will last for tens of thousands of
years. It contributes to the birth of nuclear weapons states like
North Korea. It creates tantalising targets for terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah North, Greenpeace energy campaigner, says "Nuclear sucks
crucial investment from genuine solutions, like decentralised
energy, renewables and energy efficiency. Global warming needs a
global solution, but unless we want every dictator in the world to
have access to enriched uranium, nuclear power can't be that
solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's just a handful of flaws in the IEA report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear power only produces electricity, and thus only
marginally deals with our need for services such as hot water and
central heating, and doesn't meet our energy needs for transport at
all. Instead of focusing solely on electricity production,
governments need to address the energy system as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;US researchers from the respected Rocky Mountain Institute have
estimated that for the same investment, energy efficiency can
achieve up to ten times more carbon savings than nuclear
power.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The IEA's nuclear plan would require more than 200 new reactors
in the next 24 years. Climate scientists warn we have ten years to
act.  Nuclear power plants that come on line in 2025 to 2030 will
begin replacing coal and oil too late to meet the short term need
for emission reductions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The capital and subsidies for such an unrealistic expansion
would be so huge that they would strangle investment in renewables
and energy-efficiency, which the world desperately needs. Nuclear
would prevent the very change the IEA is calling for.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The report grossly underestimates the ready potential of energy
efficiency and renewable energy - which already play a larger role
than the IEA projects for nuclear power in 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IEA report calls for radical action, but only offers
"business as usual" solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is: there's a better way than that offered by the
IEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the IEA plan, it is possible to cut emissions by
half by 2050 and meet everyone's energy supply needs without new
nuclear power or carbon capture and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maximizing energy efficiencies and renewable energies, we can
supply the energy we need sustainably, safely and economically -
all while averting dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, nuclear power is unnecessary, it's uneconomical and
it's unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up as an energy revolutionary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/energyrevolsignup?MM_URL=IEAReportSignUp"&gt;Sign up for our monthly e-zine and find out what you can do to stop global warming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=IEAReportDonate"&gt;You can help us work for a green and peaceful future with a donation today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	SolarChill is a new climate-friendly refrigeration technology using solar power, enabling delivery of vaccines and food to regions of the world without electricity. Developed by us along with six other organisations it has won the Environmental Pioneer in Refrigeration award in the 2006 Cooling Industry Awards.

            SolarChill prototypes - the vaccine cooler and the refrigerator.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SolarChill project developed a versatile refrigeration
technologythat operates on solar energy; uses environmentally safe
refrigerants;bypasses the use of lead batteries; and can also be
plugged into theelectricity grid. Developed over the last six
years, SolarChill has been fieldtested in Senegal, Indonesia, and
Cuba and once it receives WorldHealth Organisation (WHO) approval
will be deployed across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Solar Chill technology clearly demonstrates the huge,
largelyuntapped resource of clean, renewable solar power that's out
there.This innovation will improve the delivery of vaccine
programmes in manyregions of the world and save countless lives,"
said Wolfgang Lohbeckof Greenpeace Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SolarChill could replace the 100,000 kerosenerefrigerators in
use today around the world for cooling vaccines.Kerosene
refrigerators are often unreliable and produce approximatelybetween
73 and 91 million kilograms of CO2 each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed along with UNICEF, UNEP, World Health Organisation
(WHO), GTZProklima, Programmes for Appropriate Technologies in
Health (PATH) andthe Danish Technological Institute, SolarChill
will improve both humanhealth care and help fight global
warming.&lt;/p&gt;

awards ceremony&lt;/a&gt; Coca-Cola also received an award forequipping
all World Cup stadiums in Germany with refrigerationtechnology that
doesn't use powerful global warming gases and it moreenergy

	We here at Greenpeace pride ourselves in getting into places we're not supposed to be, like nuclear power plants and weapons test sites.  So it really, really hurts to get kicked out of something like the Mac Expo -- where we had permission to attend!  All we want is better environmental policies from Apple: is that so heretical that we get thrown out?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/greenpeace-volunteers-man-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/greenpeace-volunteers-man-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Why was this woman evicted from Mac Expo?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers had set up a stall to sign up fellow Mac fans in the effort to get Apple to go green. We handed out some flyers.  We handed out some organic green apples. We talked to lots of cool people about how uncool it was for Apple to be neglecting their environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tom Dowdall &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2006/10/we_love_our_macs_but_mac_expo.html"&gt; writes over on the Making Waves blog&lt;/a&gt;, "most visitors were very interested and showed support for the campaign by signing up online or writing to Steve. But it seems other exhibitors were not so happy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International campaigner at the expo, says "Apple should be a world leader in the greening of the electronics industry, not lagging behind."  Why would we expect anything less of the world's coolest company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Bottom of the barrel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple scored 11th place (out of 14) on a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/green-electronics-guide-ewaste250806/"&gt; 'Guide to Greener Electronics'&lt;/a&gt; recently released by Greenpeace, with a poor showing on almost all criteria.  The company fails to embrace the precautionary principle, withholds its full list of regulated substances, provides no timelines for eliminating toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and no commitment at all to phasing out all uses of brominated flameretardants (BFRs).  Ok, we know. That's a lot of letters. Bottom line: Apples contain poisonous stuff that ends up in China and India as e-waste, and which other computer manufacturers have committed to get rid of.  When iPods, Macs and other items in the Apple product range get thrown away, most get disassembled, melted, and picked apart by kids with no health and safety protection. NOT cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple reports on the amount of its electronic waste that gets recycled, which is a good thing.  And they do take back computers in the US for proper recycling. But worldwide, their policies on taking back products from their customers are in the back of the pack by industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for Apple to use clean components in all of its products and to provide a free take-back program to reuse and recycle its products wherever they are sold. We are challenging the world leader in design to also be a world leader in environmental innovation. We challenge Apple to have a product range on the market by 2007 which is free of the worst toxic chemicals." says Iza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The customer is always right. And the customer wants green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's the rich part. The exhibition hall may have kicked Greenpeace out, but Mac Expo is FULL of people campaigning for a greener Apple.  They're called Apple Customers. To date, more than 155,000 people have visited the Green my Apple site.  Over 1000 blogs are linking to it.  And 12,000 Apple fans have written to Steve Jobs asking him to change Apple's ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on, Steve. Anybody can pollute the planet.  Apple can think different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=expoevictiondonatelink"&gt;We don't take money from governments or corporations -- so we don't have to worry about biting the hands that feed us.  But that means we need YOUR help even more when we're fighting for the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Just weeks after we uncovered US rice on supermarket shelves in Europe contained illegal genetically engineered (GE) rice, the scandal keeps growing with more illegal GE rice being discovered. In the latest blow for the GE industry, the world's largest rice processing company has stopped importing US rice into Europe due to the threat of contamination.

            Rice is life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebro Puleva, which controls 30 percent of the European rice
market, hasstopped importing US rice due to the presence of an
illegal GE ricestrain. The rice strain causing the contamination is
called LL601 andhas not been approved for human consumption
anywhere in the world. Thecompany responsible for the contamination
is Germany's Bayer who endedfield trials of LL601 in the US five
years ago. However, the LL601 riceescaped the field trials and has
now contaminated an unknown number ofconventional rice fields
across the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/contaminated-chinese-rice090506/"&gt;
Greenpeace investigations&lt;/a&gt;recently found another illegal GE rice
contamination outbreak. Thistime it is from China and is a variety
of rice called Bt63. Like the UShowever, Bt63 rice also escaped
field trials and has now been found inprocessed rice imports into
Europe. The extent of both GEcontaminations is still unknown with
new discoveries of contaminatedrice occurring almost daily across
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move by EbroPuleva to stop importing US rice follows a
summer of scandals, withillegal GE contamination found in rice
products all over Europe as wellas in Japan. As a result of Bayer's
recklessness, the global foodindustry is facing massive costs
associated with this contamination,including testing costs, product
recalls, brand damage, import bans andcancelled imports and
contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least three multi-milliondollar class action lawsuits have
been filed by US rice farmers againstBayer CropScience already, as
farmers struggle to protect theirlivelihoods from GE contamination.
To compound Bayer's legal problems,they may soon be in the legal
sights of Ebro Puleva too. The world'slargest rice company has
indicated that they expect to bring legalactions against Bayer as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By imposing a blanket ban onrice imports from the US, Ebro
Puleva has acknowledged how real andcostly the risk of GE
contamination is," said Jeremy Tager, GEcampaigner from Greenpeace
International. "With GE now as uneconomic asit is unacceptable,
governments in countries that grow or import GEmust stop placing
farmers, consumers, the environment and industry atsuch high
risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice scandal continues to ragejust as the WTO has
finally published a ruling on a case broughtagainst the EU by the
US, Canada and Argentina over Europe imposingrestrictions on the
importing of GE food. At its heart, the dispute isabout whether
trade laws trump environmental laws - and surprise,surprise, to the
WTO it is trade law rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The WTO is clearlyunqualified to deal with complex scientific
and environmental issues,and yet, when there is a conflict between
trade and environmentalconsiderations, it is the WTO that gets to
decide which rules rule;it's like putting the fox in charge of the
chickens," said DanielMittler, Trade Policy Advisor at Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thelatest GE contamination scandal shows that once GE organisms
arereleased into the environment, the consequences for consumers,
farmersand traders are enormous. The WTO has no place determining
what peopleshould eat and illegal GE rice has no place on the
dinner tables ofconsumers anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=ge-rice-wto"&gt;Sign up for our free activist newsletter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=ge-rice-wto"&gt;Help us continue to fight against GE contamination of our food.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Huge crop circles in maize fields in Mexico, Spain and Philippines have appeared as we launch a global campaign to protect the home of maize from genetic contamination.

            Greenpeace activists create a 60 metre "NO" crop circle in a maize field in Mexico demanding the Mexico Government reject the cultivation of genetically engineered maize in the country.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico is the birthplace of maize, also known as corn, and
around 200 different varieties grow in the country. Maize is one of
the biggest food crops in the world and feeds hundreds of millions
of people every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If genetically engineered (GE) maize is allowed to be released
into the environment in Mexico, it could contaminate the natural
genetic diversity of maize with unknown consequences. There has
already been GE contamination of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/the-end-of-organic-crops/"&gt;
organic maize in Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now increasing pressure on the Mexican Government from
GE companies to allow for the growing of GE maize in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Greenpeace campaign is demanding that:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governments around the world place a ban on the release of any
GE crop or seed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governments withdraw existing authorizations for both
commercial and experimental growing of GE crops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genetic contamination of crops must be cleaned up, with costs
borne by biotech companies such as Monsanto, according to the
"polluter pays" principle.&lt;/li&gt;

	Fishing and prostitution might be the two oldest professions. But the exploitation of both is creating new vulnerabilities for Pacific islands as the whole world increasingly comes to fish in its waters. Ben Bohane reports from Kiribati.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A mother and her child wait for Sunday mass to begin in a Catholic church in Tarawa. The heads of the two major churches in Kiribati have renewed criticism of local women boarding foreign fishing vessels. The church leaders said they are worried about the spread of prostitution.

            A baby sleeping in a Betio slum. The problem of increasing prostitution is linked to a number of factors. An ever-increasing youth population, crowded housing conditions, lack of employment and educational opportunities has left young people vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation, either for cash, transport, food or other material goods. 
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Linda, 21, a sexworker who says she spends days and nights on visiting purse seiners in the Tarawa harbour. Kiribati may be breaching international conventions on child protection since many of the sexworkers are only 14 and 15 years of age.   
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deck of the Taiwanese purse-seiner bustles with activity. At
anchora few kilometres off Tarawa in Kiribati, tons of skipjack
tuna arelifted from a refrigerated hold up onto the sweltering
topdeck fortranshipment to a ship moored beside it. Whistles blow,
nets ofshimmering fish are raised and swung onto the mothership,
which willtake its cargo to canneries in Papua New Guinea and
Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butlook closer and another small transhipment is also taking
place betweenthe two rolling boats. A young girl is gingerly easing
herself downthick ropes from the mothership onto the purse-seiner.
It is a delicatebalancing act 20 metres above water and for a
moment she looks like atrapeze artist, walking the tightrope. She
smiles at one of theTaiwanese crew as she drops like a cat onto the
deck and disappearsinto a nearby cabin. Here in Kiribati she is
known as a "korakorea"girl; a girl who spends time with
fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Not as romantic as it seems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inthe Pacific, the practice of sweet young girls paddling out to
foreignboats to introduce their charms to restless seamen is
nothing new, itis almost a cliché of Pacific history. European
sailors were fond ofdropping anchor in places like Tahiti knowing
they would be "warmlywelcomed" after long and lonely months at sea.
Such women helped causemutiny on the Bounty, and much else to
inspire romantic notions inEurope that the Pacific islands were an
Eden of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Althoughthe practice continues today, there is little romance
and far moredangers involved for the girls - the spectre of AIDS
andsocial/psychological consequences of girls as young as 12
involvedgives the fishing industry a dark side that is rarely
contemplated whenconsumers open a tin of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, there are growingsocial consequences as a result of
a rapacious fishing industry worthan estimated US$2.7 billion per
year. More than half the world's tuna,about 2 million tons per
year, now comes from the Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why the world is coming to the Pacific for fish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThePacific ocean holds the world's last great fish supply -
since many ofthe world's oceans have been substantially overfished
in recentdecades. The EU, after enforcing a moratorium on cod
fishing in theAtlantic which put much of the European fleet on dry
dock, has recentlysigned a number of bi-lateral deals with Pacific
island states to fishin their waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe now sources much of its tuna from thePacific - in
Germany, for example, half the tuna consumed there comesfrom
Kiribati alone. The EU fleet now joins China, Taiwan, Japan,Russia,
America, The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and others whoare
ranging far into the Pacific, often unmonitored, to harvest
schoolsof fish (mainly tuna) on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Korakorea girls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/a-mother-and-her-child-wait-fo.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;Asin most places, prostitution is hardly
a modern phenomenon.  InKiribati, the term "korakorea" was first
coined to describe local girlswho went aboard Korean fishing
vessels, but is now more generally usedfor girls going onboard
fishing boats from any country as well as beingslang for "cheap
fish".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many do it because of poverty at homeand the chance to earn
money, clothes and fish to take home. Some girlsget pressured by
their families to do it. Others claim they do it sothey can get
"drinking money for their friends" and because the foreignfishermen
treat them better than their local men do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isno law against prostitution in Kiribati, which was
highlighted recentlywhen 80 girls were rounded up and brought
before a local court beforebeing released. Yet there is growing
concern that Kiribati maybebreaching international conventions on
child protection since many ofthe girls are only 14 and 15 years of
age. UNICEF is preparing torelease a damning document relating to
underage prostitution in severalPacific countries, including
Kiribati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Kathy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One girl involved in the trade, "Kathy", claims girls as young
as 12 are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Iknow about one 12 year old girl who was taken out to a fishing
boat byher aunty and she has disappeared. Her family are very
worried sinceshe has been missing now for 4 months".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy is a pretty 21year old girl who lives with her father, an
unemployed formergovernment worker, in a crowded settlement near
the Betio port on southTarawa. She claims there are many local
girls involved in the trade andthey all have different
motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It all depends becausesome they really need money to support
their families with food, sothey feel some pressure. Other girls
need money to buy drinks forthemselves and friends when they want
to go out to the bars".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathysays that even though their have been crackdowns by local
authoritiesthe girls are not scared of getting caught by police
because "theirfamily are supporting them".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Taking advantage of history and attitudes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/baby-slum.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;Thisis what makes prostitution in
Kiribati and other Pacific islands acomplex issue. For many Pacific
cultures it is not a big deal; sex,custom and fishing are all
intertwined, subject to tabus. Manyislanders do not view such
exchanges as "prostitution". Fishing and sexhave long been linked
to traditions that were, in itself, notnecessarily a bad thing,
because everything was shared withincommunities and remote islands
needed "new blood" to prevent inbreedingand keep the tribe strong
to defend from raiding enemies. Ritualexchanges of things like fish
and women kept the peace amongneighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kiribati, as a recent UNICEF document points out,
prostitution is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In1826 prostitutes were referred to as Nikiranroro, meaning
those who hadlost their virginity or had eloped. Whalers were much
criticised andblamed for having increased prostitution in the
islands...and thatvenereal disease was said to have been more
widespread after whalingcontacts".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Modern times&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/kiribati-dance.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;AsPresident of the Kiribati National
Council of Women (AMAK), Mere agreesthe korakorea issue is a
complex one, but believes that young girlsshould be in school and
better guided by their parents or guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Itis an issue here because it is against our culture and
tradition. Inthe olden days, at age 14 or 15, girls were kept in
the home doing workthat assured your future life as a woman and
they were very restrictedin their night time outings. But now
Kiribati is in the swell ofglobalisation and the issue of
korakorea...well, that's how thingshappen now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernity, a cash economy and the loss of traditionhas created
new vulnerabilities for coastal communities of the Pacific.Legal
and illegal fishing by foreign vessels have introduced a range
ofsocial problems apart from the environmental impact of depleted
fishstocks. Mere believes there is a "dangerous cycle" linking
alcoholabuse, violence, sexual abuse and disease that is afflicting
manyPacific nations including her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities that once sharedeverything now find a new rich/poor
divide is splitting them and AIDSis an ever present danger.
According to the HIV AIDS clinic at TarawaGeneral Hospital,
Kiribati (population 92,000) has 43 confirmed AIDScases of which 26
have already died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'd say almost all thecases of AIDS here are related to the
fishing industry" claims one ofthe nurses testing blood samples.
"It is coming from both foreignfishermen and our own sailors
returning home".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;More enforcement tools needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25503/linda-taiwan-boat.jpg" align="left" hspace="3"&gt;DavidYee Ting, Kiribati's Permanent
Secretary for Fisheries, claims that thegovernment is getting on
top of the situation, saying, "Our new PoliceCommissioner has been
enforcing the laws to stop girls - and those whohelp them - go out
to the boats."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He confirms that the situationgot so bad that for a period in
2003, Kiribati actually banned allKorean fishing boats from
entering Kiribati ports after reports in theKorean Herald that
30-50 girls, mostly underage, were servicing theKorean
fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he thought Kiribati was alsogetting ripped off on
its core asset, fisheries, Ting says "That's abit harsh, but yes,
we could be getting a better return. We only haveone patrol boat
and we don't have many trained fisheries officers whocan be
stationed on boats to monitor catches."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But as Pacificstates come together through regional bodies like
the FFA (ForumFisheries Authority, based in Solomon Islands) and
the WCPFC (Westernand Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, based
in Marshall Islands), Ibelieve we will have more collective power
to get a better deal on ourfish resources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ting is upbeat about the recent deal signedbetween the EU and
Kiribati, believing the EU will help develop thelocal industry with
more local employment and training. Other observersare not so
sanguine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we should have vessels from5,000 miles away
fishing here. Why are they fishing here? Because theyhave stuffed
their own region and now they are coming down here to doit" is the
blunt assessment of Captain David Lucas, manager of SolanderPacific
Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've got purse-seiners from the European Unionfishing in
Kiribati. Why should they be down here? What have they doneto their
own? Who's next?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the Esperanza weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/"&gt;Find out what's happening right now in the Defending Our Oceans expedition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	When you live off the land any change in climate can have profound effects. This Tibetan woman used to have a healthy herd of animals to support her family. Now due to the lack of rain and spreading deserts on the Tibetan plateau her income has disappeared. Try telling her that global warming isn't a reality.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A 31-year-old Tibetan woman at her home in Yellow River township. Once she lived well from the profits off her animals. Now, due to climate change, she is reduced to a life of poverty. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as the roof of the
world, landof high peaks, glaciers and nomadic tribal peoples. The
snowy peaks andglaciers are the source of many of Asia's mightiest
rivers - theGanges, Mekong and China's Yellow River. This area is
predicted to warmconsiderably before 2100 due to global warming.
The roof of the worldis melting, and melting fast.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;A little less ice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what's the big deal about a little less ice in a place full
of thestuff anyway? Actually it's a disaster for the region now, 
and theramifications may yet be felt across the globe. We visited
the region tohighlight the impacts of the changing climate of the
Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the area warms less rain is falling and glaciers in the
region aremelting. Local communities used to make a living of their
herds ofanimals grazing on lush mountain pastures. Now those
pastures are fastturning to desert due to lack of water,
overgrazing and erosion causedby new animals that are thriving in
the warmer conditions. Many localpeople now survive solely on
government handouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/globalwarmingyellowrivermaduo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Onour expedition to the region we travelled on "dancing roads"
distortedby melting permafrost to meet the governor of Madoi
County. In 1980, Madoi wasChina's richest province due to its
agricultural wealth. It is  now China'spoorest. We interviewed
once-prosperous, but now destitute,farmers and saw first hand the
desert gobbling up pasture land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is causing a cocktail of environmental effects at
theYellow River source that threaten an ecological breakdown. When
you seethe empty wells, bridges over nothing but dry dirt, cracked
groundwhere there should be lakes, bare rock and sand where it was
oncehealthy grassland you know something is seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2005/10/yellow-river-site.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See more impacts in the region at our Yellow River site in &lt;a href="http://activism.greenpeace.org/yellowriver/en.html"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://www.yellowriversource.org/cn.html"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the immediate impacts on the area are bad enough they
palecompared to the possible future impacts in the rest of China.
TheYellow River has fed China's people since time immemorial.
Today, 120million Chinese people, a tenth of China's population,
rely on theriver, especially for irrigating crops. As well as being
known asChina's 'mother river', is also dubbed the 'cradle of the
Chinesecivilization'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell"&gt;
&lt;img style="padding: 4px; float: left;" src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25638/the-first-bridge-over-the-yell.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Nowthe mother river is drying up at its source. In many places
onthe upper stretches the flow is much reduced. If the flow of the
rivercontinues to decline it threatens the food supplies for a
large part ofChina's population.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;Alarm bell for the world&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butthis isn't just a problem for China. Many of Asia's rivers
begin on theTibetan Plateau. If it continues to dry this could
affect many ofthese rivers and the millions of people who rely on
them. As well as water shortages, scientistspredict that rising
temperatures will reduce the rice crops that arethe staple food for
more than half of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How would the world feed millions of people who cannot rely on locally produced rice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Yellow River source region is an urgent warning that climate
changeis harming people now and is going to get worse. The Yellow
River storyis not just about China, it's a warning signal that we
need  worldwideaction on global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action on global warming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/12_steps"&gt;Even if you never see the Yellow River you can do something about global warming with these steps for individual action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?appeal_id=163_127"&gt;Support our fight against global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After three days of blockading the toxic tanker Probo Koala, we were pleased to hear that the Government of Estonia is investigating the ship, which is responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people in the Ivory Coast -- and the illnesses of thousands more, due to irresponsible dumping of toxic waste.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Helen Perivier explains, "The Probo Koala
is aninternational toxic crime scene and needs to be fully
investigated toestablish the full chain of culpability which led to
the tragic deadlyevents in the Ivory Coast," she said. "Only
through such aninvestigation can the guilty be brought to justice
and the lessonslearned in order to prevent this from happening
again."  We weredelighted to hear that the Estonian Authorities are
now taking suchaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dumping the West's waste ... in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thescandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties were reported
andprotests broke out on the streets of Abidjan against the
government,which was blamed for allowing the dumping.  Despite
this, theKorean-built, Greek-managed, Panamanian-flagged and
Dutch-charteredtanker was allowed to sail freely …until we blocked
it from leavingEstonia.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finland receives Golden Chainsaw award</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finland-chainsaw-260906/</url><text>
	In the decades between the 1950s and 1970s birch trees in Finland were considered 'flora non grata' by foresters as they weren't commercially useful. They were routinely cut down and poisoned to reduce their numbers. In some areas, the Finns even resorted to spraying the birch forests with the deadly defoliant Agent Orange, of Vietnam War infamy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/clearcut-forest-in-russia-muc.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/clearcut-forest-in-russia-muc.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Clearcut forest in Russia. Much of the timber from clearcuts like these are destined for Finland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now however, the birch tree is commercially useful as pulp for
the paper industry. Not surprisingly after destroying so much birch
forest for decades, the Finns don't have enough birch forest left
for the requirements of their timber industry. So now they import
birch logs from Russia, many of which are illegally logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forest-crime-finland/"&gt;
recent investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed the extent of this trade in
illegal logs across the Russian-Finnish border. The response of the
Finnish Government to the illegal logging uncovered by the
investigation has been to shrug its shoulders:  no government
action required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an unacceptable response from a Government that
considers itself a 'superpower of forests'. Having abdicated its
responsibilities to control illegal timber coming across its
borders to industry, it doesn't even get involved when presented
with evidence of industry failure", said Sini Harkki, Greenpeace
Nordic campaigner. "We've decided to award Finland with the
infamous Golden Chainsaw award, which we reserve for the worst
forest crime offenders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent World Bank report cited the cost of lost revenues to
the market and governments due to illegal activity at US$10-15
billion annually. In the face of the massive trade in illegal
timber, the European Commission is currently considering
legislative options to tackle the problem of illegally logged
timber being imported into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ban on illegal timber being imported and sold in Europe has
strong support from Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the
business community. Greenpeace, together with over &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/controlling-timber-imports-int-2/"&gt;
160 NGO's&lt;/a&gt; and over 80 businesses, including IKEA, Homebase,
Castorama France, B&amp;amp;Q, Finnforest (UK) are all calling for EU
legislation to make it illegal to import illegally sourced timber
and wood products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's response to the problem has been weak,
claiming that voluntary measures are enough. Beyond that the
European Commission has been taking the slow road to action, with a
promised report on options on further legislation to stem the flow
of illegal timber due over two years ago. It is now time for action
from the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we are calling for is European-Union-wide legislation to
ensure that illegally logged timber does not end up on the European
market whether it is from Russia, the Amazon, Indonesia or
laundered from Asia and the Pacific through China", said Sue
Connor, Greenpeace forest campaigner. "Finland must start acting as
a responsible state body and support the call for EU legislation to
ban illegal timber."&lt;/p&gt;

	After helping mitigate the devastation wrought by the Petron oil spill in Guimaras Island, the Esperanza led a flotilla in protest against the gold and silver mining operations of Lafayette in the Philippines, funded by banks such as ABN-AMRO and ANZ. The Australian-owned mine was reopened in July despite government investigations which revealed ongoing leakages of highly toxic chemicals into the pristine waters of the Albay Gulf.

            Flotilla of local boats accompanies Greenpeace ship Esperanza on protest against pollution caused by Layayette mine on Rapu Rapu Island, Philippines.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza sailed into Rapu-Rapu Island accompanied by
villagers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from the provinces of Sorsogon and Albay on board some 70
bancas (traditional outrigger boats) bearing banners saying "Stop
Lafayette"and "ABN-Amro, ANZ Stop Funding Marine Pollution".  Dutch
bankABN-Amro, one of the world's biggest financial institutions,
andAustralian bank ANZ are providing financial backing for the
miningoperations. This is despite the fact that both banks have
policies inplace which are supposed to prevent them from investing
in socially andenvironmentally irresponsible projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Toxics Campaigner Beau Baconguis said, "People rely on the
richmarine ecosystem for food and income and have already suffered
fromcontinuous toxic contamination from the Lafayette mine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rapu Rapu - Countdown to an environmental disaster&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Lafayette was ordered to stop its mining
operationsafter it twice released cyanide and other contaminants
into theenvironment, resulting in massive fish kills. Subsequent
investigationscarried out  by a Presidential Fact-Finding
Commission revealedthat not only had Lafayette been operating the
mine beyond its capacitybut that it had been doing so even before
it completed the constructionof barriers designed to prevent
contamination reaching the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine government then granted the company a licence for
a 30-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day test run of the mine. During the test run, several toxic
leaksoccurred. Residents have since reported more fish  kills in
thecreeks leading out from the mine into Albay Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The reopening of Lafayette mine has started the clock for
anotherdisaster in our marine ecosystem. Lafayette mine must be
closed forgood," Beau added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pristine waters, seagrass beds and mangroves of Albay Gulf
createan exceptionally rich fishing ground for fishermen. Dolphins,
seaturtles, egrets, and purple herons are frequently sighted in
thesewaters. Five of the seven marine turtles in the world are
found in theAlbay Gulf, while the eastern coast, including Rapu
Rapu, is amigration path for whale sharks. The Lafayette mine
threatens thesurvival of all of these species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Arroyo government's support for the mining operation makes
it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;part of the problem and not the solution," said Baconguis.
"Rather&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than serve the interests of mining corporations the government
must&lt;/p&gt;

	It's a bluefin tuna graveyard, white crosses float next to tuna ranch cages. We end our three month Mediterranean tour back where we started, in Spain, highlighting the desperate state of bluefin tuna stocks.

            Greenpeace activists from the Rainbow Warrior create a syymbolic "tuna graveyard" with mock crosses inside a tuna ranch in Cartagena, Southeast Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tour that started with the launch of the Greenpeace
tunareport onboard the Esperanza in Barcelona, we've confirmed our
worstfears about the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin
tuna are being plundered, illegal driftnets known as "wallsof
death" continue to be used despite their prohibition and the
rampantoverdevelopment of the Mediterranean coastline is destroying
coastalecosytems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as we showed with the proposal for a network of marine
reserves for the Mediterranean, there is still hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theRainbow Warrior concludes the 2006 tour of the
Mediterranean, we lookback on some of the highlights and many
suprises from the past threemonths. From diving and documenting the
beauty below the surface,confiscating illegal driftnets and
rescuing sailors from sinking boatsto being blockaded by the
fishermen in Marseille, it's certainly been amemorable tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Mediterranean is in desperate need of a sea change
-literally. The large industrial fishing fleets are out of control,
thetuna ranches are out of control, the illegal driftnetters are
out ofcontrol, even the jellyfish are out of control, partly due to
its mainpredators like tuna and sea turtles being wiped out," said
KarliThomas, of Greenpeace International. "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;

the Mediterranean species and theirhabitat and definitely help to

<item><language>en</language><title>The trawl's in your court New Zealand</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bottom-trawler-protested-nz/</url><text>
	Over the past weekend, Greenpeace activists in New Zealand  locked down  a high seas bottom trawler stopping it leaving the New Zealand port of Nelson. [Watch the TV footage here] Two activists climbed the mast and made themselves inaccessible and another attached herself to the mooring lines while another team of activists locked metal braces and a large sculpture of a deep-sea coral to the vessel's stern with a banner reading "The Trawl's in your Court NZ" - A clear challenge to the New Zealand Government.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/8/two-greenpeace-activists-aboar.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/8/two-greenpeace-activists-aboar.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Two Greenpeace activists aboard Belize flagged Chinese bottom trawler Chang Xing in Port Nelson, New Zealand. The two activists along with one other attached to the mooring line stopped the vessel from leaving port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trawler was the notorious Chang Xing - one of the high seas
bottom trawlers that we happen know a lot about. We know that she
has been operating in several oceans, and we know that she destroys
deep-sea life wherever she goes.  In June 2004, the Rainbow Warrior
headed into the international waters of the Tasman Sea to &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea/archives/tasman2004"&gt;document
the activities&lt;/a&gt; of high seas bottom trawlers fishing for
slimehead (or, as it has been renamed to sound more appealing for
marketing purposes: Orange Roughy).  And you guessed it - &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea/archives/2004/06/what_a_day.html"&gt;
there it was&lt;/a&gt; - the Chang Xing busily scouring the seafloor with
huge weighted nets hauling up everything and anything unlucky
enough to be in their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Chang Xing's wake, the Rainbow Warrior's  crew picked up
all manner of weird and wonderful deep-sea creatures including a
delicate branch of endangered black coral that is protected under
CITES (Convention on Trade in Endangered Species).  All were thrown
over the side as unwanted 'by-catch".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/greenpeace-activist-tia-taurer" onclick="window.open('http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/greenpeace-activist-tia-taurer','popup','width=470,height=435,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25369/greenpeace-activist-tia-taurer.jpg" alt="Protester and police officer." align="left" height="136" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Meanwhile, back on land, we
did a bit of extra research to determine the history and ownership
of the Chang Xing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang Xing flies the flag of Belize, but is owned by a
Chinese company with connections to New Zealand and Fijian
companies.  Belize does not regulate the activities of its high
seas vessels and is one of the four main 'flag of convenience'
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belize (a small Caribbean nation) does not regulate the
activities of its high seas vessels. It is one country counted in
the top four 'flag-of-convenience' countries in a 2005 report
funded by the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Forestry. In terms that Greenpeace uses, what the Chang Xing does,
is pirate fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Rainbow Warrior observed the Chang Xing fishing, she
was bottom trawling for orange roughy oin the NW Challenger Plateau
in the Tasman Sea - within 20 miles of six licensed, New Zealand-
flagged bottom trawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2005, the New Zealand government announced that
they&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"would be prepared to support in principle, the concept
of an interim global moratorium on bottom trawling on the high seas
if such a proposal had sufficient support to be a practical and
enforceable option for improving biodiversity protection on the
high seas."   &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a very long-winded way of saying that they would support
a moratorium if all other countries do too. Since then, we've heard
a whole lot of reasons why New Zealand won't support a moratorium. 
One of the most important has been that it is only vessels flagged
to 'responsible' states (like New Zealand and Australia) that are
bottom trawling on the high seas and so it is not a big problem -
because they regulate their vessels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/nelson-30-july-2006-greenpeac" onclick="window.open('http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/photo-audio-video/photos/nelson-30-july-2006-greenpeac', 'item_552905', 'height=511,width=465'); return false;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/Teaser/PageFiles/25369/nelson-30-july-2006-greenpeac.jpg" alt="Protest." align="left" height="126" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Chang Xing shows that is not the case. The
presence of New Zealand flagged bottom trawlers fishing nearby
underlines the fact that so-called 'responsible' vessels do the
same terrible damage to a sensitive and vulnerable deep-sea
ecosystem.  These bottom trawlers all use the same fishing gear.
Nets weighing tens of tons that are dragged over the delicate and
ancient eco-systems destroying all in their path before scientists
even get a chance to see what is down there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2005, the Rainbow Warrior &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea/archives/tasman2005/"&gt;went
back to the Tasman Sea&lt;/a&gt; and recorded the New Zealand flagged
bottom trawler Waipori  fishing for Orange Roughy.  The Rainbow
Warrior crew recorded the Waipori hauling a huge 400 year old
Gorgonian coral in its nets.  It took 2 men to throw the huge piece
over the side, dead.  New Zealand is certainly responsible for the
damage caused by its vessel and is now also responsible for
supplying a known flag- of- convenience vessel.  But because there
are no rules in place for most of the international waters of the
high seas when it comes to bottom trawling, New Zealand can say
that they have done nothing wrong.  Doing nothing can sometimes
have huge consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 30, 2006 a New Zealand &lt;a href="http://www.tv3.co.nz/default.aspx?tabid=112&amp;amp;articleID=11733"&gt;
TV3 report&lt;/a&gt; quotes a spokesperson for the New Zealand Fisheries
Minister as saying that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"while the government supported a worldwide moratorium
it doubted it would happen because of a lack of political will from
other countries." &lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is New Zealand waiting for?  It is a country known for its
sheep but not for acting like one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to the issue of defending the Pacific from nuclear
testing, New Zealand didn't say there was a lack of political will
and sit back and watch. New Zealand led the way to a nuclear- free
Pacific. Back in 1989/90, New Zealand led the successful political
push for a global moratorium on high seas 'walls of death' driftnet
fishing, without hesitation or wavering over whether Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan and other driftnet fishing countries would go along
with it. And earlier this year, New Zealand didn't argue there was
a lack of political will when it came to the issue of defending the
whales on the high seas from countries like Japan and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the high seas bottom trawling  issue, there are already a
number of  countries leading the way and they come from all corners
of the world: Brazil in Latin America, Sweden and the United
Kingdom in Europe, and Palau and Tuvalu in the Pacific.  Isn't it
time that New Zealand found its mettle once again and stepped out
in front like they so often do, instead of hiding like sheep behind
excuses like "lack of political will"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand, the trawl is in your court!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stop bottom trawling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2165130&amp;amp;referrer%5fid="&gt;Send a note to Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand, and other responsible politicians.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The countdown to another oceans disaster has begun. The start of the controlled 30-day test run granted to Australian mining company Lafayette by the Philippine government signalled the resumption of the company's operations in Rapu Rapu. This is expected to be a mere prelude to its ongoing operations, despite cyanide spills, pollution, extractive damage and violations of requirements for the Environmental Compliance Certificate.

here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Negligent mining operations: "too
fast, too soon"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its few months of operation, the mining company showed
negligence with regard to its operations. (During the Rapu Rapu
Fact-finding Commission hearings in April-May 2006, Lafayette
officials in fact admitted that they mined "too fast, too soon"
even while the mine's structural safeguards meant to minimize
environmental damage were not yet completed.) As a result, after
heavy rains in October 11 and 31, 2005, cyanide and other
contaminants from the mine spilled into the sea and around the
island, resulting in massive fish kills which Lafayette, to this
day, continues to downplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2006, Lafayette was fined PhP10.7 million (about
$206,850 USD), PhP10.4 million (about $201,060 USD) for violating
the Clean Water Act, and PhP300,000 (about 5,800 USD) for violating
the conditions of their Environmental Compliance Certificate
(ECC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They paid only PhP300,000 initially, and contested the rest of
the fine, only paying up 6 months later (on June 20), when payment
for the fine was stipulated as a precondition to the mine's 30-day
test run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The toxic test-run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-day test run period was granted to Lafayette by the DENR,
and was given despite the mine's several violations to their ECC,
is expected to be a mere prelude to the mine's complete
reopening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Another spill is not necessary to demonstrate that Lafayette's
mining operations will be severely detrimental to Rapu Rapu and its
surrounding waters. This operation is a self-perpetuating
ecological disaster that will leave serious, long-term negative
effects on the oceans at the expense of the area's outlying coastal
communities for generations to come," said Greenpeace Southeast
Asia Toxics campaigner Beau Baconguis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By allowing Lafayette's reopening, the government has once
again betrayed its duplicitous nature- shamelessly mouthing
platitudes and clichés for a 'Green Philippines' while willingly
condoning long-term damage to the environment in its myopic pursuit
of spurious economic gains."&lt;/p&gt;

in the history of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On August 11th, a single hull oil tanker chartered by Petron
Corp., the largest oil refiner in the Philippines, sank in rough
seas.  Roughly 320 km (200 miles) of coastline is covered in thick
sludge.  Miles of coral reef and mangrove forests have been
decimated and more than 1,100 hectares (2,470 acres) of marine
reserve badly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ground zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first sight the situation in the worst affected area, on the
south of Guimaras Island, seems deceptively tranquil.  In La Paz,
located nearest the sunken tanker, the villagers have cleaned their
beaches with astonishing speed.  As our boat takes us across the
shallow bay there is no obvious oil slick.  All seems nearly normal
- but only to those not familiar with the sea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Normally the water is light green here, and you can see down to
the ground", says district counsellor Norma Lariosa - worrying
about the new murkiness. "Now it is olive, and you see nothing."
The oil has not retreated from La Paz. It has only split up into
millions of tiny drops - and that could make it even more
dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galuna lives a 15-minute boat drive north of La Paz, in a small
village called Citio Alman Sur. Here the enemy is still in full
view. Galuna's bamboo-house is only 20 meters from the shore. It's
built on stilts so the family virtually sleeps above the sea. Now
they are sleeping above bunker oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spill hit Citio Alman Sur the evening of Friday, August
12th. Roger was in his backyard when he wondered what was so
slippery under his feet. He looked down and found black oil gushing
between his toes. He turned and saw the mangroves painted black up
to the waterline. That was when he became afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mangroves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25365/mangrove-roots-and-new-shoots-3.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The mangroves are the breeding ground for the fish in the
area", explained local council member Lariosa. She fears a massive
decrease in the number of fish in the next generations. Worse, the
mangroves might die.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace toxics expert Dr. Janet Cotter, who
examined the damage on site by boat: "Mangroves breathe through
their roots. When these roots are covered with oil for weeks, the
plants will slowly suffocate." Dr. Cotter also fears the splitting
up of the oil and mixing with water will make it more toxic to the
ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Resurreccion Sadaba, an expert on mangroves with the
University of the Philippines, heard about the sunken tanker he was
especially worried about one mangrove tree from the species
Rhizophora lamarckii. "It is a very rare species, there is only
this single tree on the whole island." When Sadaba arrived on the
island he found his worst fears had turned reality. His mangrove
tree was covered with oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I started crying", says Sadaba.  "Ninety percent of the
mangroves in the marine reserve have their roots full of oil."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Communities hard hit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25365/locals-and-greenpeace-activist.jpg"&gt;
On the next day the wind turns and blows a new oil slick into the
bay of La Paz.  Even if the fishermen went out very far their catch
will still be contaminated and cannot be sold, says Edgar Garde,
chairman of the local fishery department. 298 fishermen are
registered in La Paz. Nine out of ten families here depend on the
ocean for their living, and now face an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the threat from poisonous oil fumes. One man
collapsed when he came back from sea and had to be taken to
hospital. Older people have been forced to seek refuge with
relatives far from the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some journalists are comparing the situation with the disaster
of the Exxon Valdez, but Governor Joaquin Nava worries it could be
worse.  In this case, the tanker is sunk in deep water and
continues to leak oil - an ecological time bomb.  The governor has
demanded the oil company pay to have the tanker lifted or the oil
siphoned off saying, "If not, the situation could be worse than
with the Exxon Valdez, because the oil spill will continue for a
long time". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tanker held 2.1 million litres (555,000 gallons).  Roughly
ten percent of this has already spilled, and the ship continues to
leak an estimated 100 to 200 litres of oil per hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in La Paz are already talking about growing vegetables as
a replacement. "We know that the supply from the government will
not last forever", says village counsellor Gamuya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for fisherman Guluna, he now collects wood to make charcoal
coal. This provides some income, though not enough to support his
family.  Still, he remains determined, telling us, "I am a
Filipino. I am resilient, I will find a way."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet this attitude in every village we visit in Guimaras.
People are angry, they ask for support - but not for pity. They
know how to make a living, but for that they need the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

            Does this belong to you? Apple e-waste in China.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen the electronic graveyards in China and India where
old electronic devices end up, Macs included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'veseen children waist-deep in cables, keyboards and circuit
boardspicking through a soup of hazardous chemicals, including lead
andmercury, to find components or bits of metal they can sell.
We'veseen them breathing in dioxins as the PVC cables and casings
burnaround them, watched them stop drinking from local wells
polluted withheavy metals. Lives are being cut short for thousands
of children inthe developing world exposed to dangerous
chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not what Apple is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appleknows more about simple, "clean" design than any other
computermanufacturer on the planet. You'd expect Apple to be the
world leaderin clean environmental practice. But they're not.  Far
from it.Apple products contain hazardous substances which other
manufacturershave commited to stop using.  While Apple has
introduced a limitedtake-back policy in the US, other companies
have worldwide take-backand recycling programmes that are far
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is going to make Apple change its ways?  You are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Think different: Green my Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wedecided to Think Different on this campaign.  We're not
hangingbanners off the Apple HQ or using our ships to blockade
their supplychain or bungy-jumping into the next MacWorld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we knowa force that Apple listens to, and which can make
Apple adopt cleanproduction policies and improve its recycling
programmes. It's Apple'scustomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple listens to the people who buy their product: it's one of
the things we all love about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andit's why we want you to run this campaign.  We want you to
createthe campaign T-shirt, pen the speech in which Steve Jobs

Cupertino talking aboutclean production and take-back schemes. The

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Come on, Steve. Be a hero for the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rapu Rapu island mine test run ends today</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/island-mine-disaster-looming/</url><text>
	Marred by accusations of spills and heavy-handed efforts to prevent independent monitoring, the island mine on Rapu Rapu finished its 30-day "test run" today.  At dawn, Greenpeace activists scaled the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) building and unfurled a giant banner with the words "Lafayette Mining: Countdown to an Oceans Disaster".  
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/8/greenpeace-activists-unfurl-a.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2006/8/greenpeace-activists-unfurl-a.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists unfurl a banner in protest over the conduct of the 30-day test run which the Department of Energy and Natural Resources granted to Australian mining Lafayette last month.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lafayette's 30-day test run which ends today marks
thebeginnings of another imminent disaster on the seas around Rapu
Rapu,"said Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigner Beau Baconguis. In
our view, the testrun has now been exposed as nothing more than a
charade to pave the way forLafayette's untrammelled operations in
Rapu Rapu," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian mining company Lafayette was ordered to haltits
operations late last year after two mine spills released cyanide
and othercontaminants from the mine and into the sea around the
island, causing massivefish kills. Subsequent investigations by a
Presidential Fact-finding Committeein April-May 2006 revealed
admissions from Lafayette officials that the companyhad been mining
beyond its capacity even while the structural safeguards meantto
minimize environmental damage were not yet completed. The DENR,
however,allowed Lafayette to continue operations despite these
lapses by granting thecompany a 30-day test run on July 11,
2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Recent spills and more to come?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leak occurred during operations two days into the test run,
but the DENR wasquick to dismiss this as a minor incident. Less
than two weeks later on July18, 2006, residents reported a fish
kill in the island's Mirikpitik creek.Residents have since reported
more fish kills in creeks leading out from themine into the sea,
but so far, aside from dismissing the incidents as resultsof
"sabotage," there has been no active and convincing response onthe
part of the company and the DENR to verify and explain these
reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If it proved anything at all, this test run demonstrated very
clearlythat the government will do everything, including turning a
blind eye to whatis now shaping up as another disaster in the
making. The pretence involved inthe test run is so obvious, nobody
is deceived by it," Baconguis stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Lack of transparency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the heavy presence of military, police, and private
security aroundthe island, including in small, remote barangays
[villages] located well beyondthe mine's boundaries, belie DENR's
and Lafayette's claims of full transparencyduring the 30-day test
run. Monitoring and inspection by independent partiesconcerned
about the negative effects of the mining operation are
activelydiscouraged and even prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Andrade, a Greenpeace employee sent to investigatereports
of a fish kill was detained at gunpoint while on public land - and
hiswater samples were confiscated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Rapu Rapu Island as well as in Legaspi,inquiries
at local government offices regarding the composition of the
DENR-appointed mine monitoring committee during the test run have
beenunsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Controversies have shrouded Lafayette's test run from the
beginning, butthe most glaring of all is its total lack of
transparency," saidBaconguis, "This bodes ill for the future of the
fragile marineenvironment that surrounds Rapu Rapu, and the people
who depend on it - thatis, unless the DENR finally acts in the
interest of the environment rather thanfor myopic corporate and
economic interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help stop the mine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/send-letter?letter_id=2189327"&gt;Send a petition to Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Facing down stick-wielding personnel, water-canon-spraying marine police,and gun-wielding navy seals, five Greenpeace activists in Thailand have delayed a shipment of Australian coal from being unloaded at a controversial coal plant in Maptaphut, Thailand.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in Thailand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five activists chained themselves to the pier bumper and
hung banners that read 'Coal = climate change, Clean Energy Now'.
They remained for two hours before being detained by police with
the help of Navy seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 170,00 tonne carrier, MV Star Europe, carrying a large
shipment of coal from Newcastle, NSW (the world's largest coal
exporting port) has been anchored a few nautical miles away,
waiting for the area to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coal plant, BLCP,  is jointly owned by Banpu and Hong Kong
based China Light and scheduled to open in October. BLCP is a
classic example of dirty international financing by the likes of
Asian Development Bank and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The BLCP coal plant will exacerbate the impacts of climate
change, which is already starting to exact a heavy toll on the
people and economies of Thailand and Southeast Asia. It does not
help that Australia is fuelling climate change in the region with
its coal exports," said Tara Buakamsri of Greenpeace Southeast
Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thailand must stop any further use of coal and put a policy in
place for the massive increase of renewable energy and energy
efficiency projects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1,434 MW BLCP coal plant will release nearly 12 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, and once in operation this
plant alone will cause Thailand's carbon emissions to rise by
almost 6 percent a year, according to Greenpeace projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, emitting 29 percent more
carbon per unit of energy than oil and 80 percent more than gas,
and contributing significantly to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal and coal-fired power stations have been strongly opposed
by communities in the region. However, the Australian government
refuses to take action on global warming while ignoring climate
impacts on its own citizens and other countries in Asia. The whole
region will be further threatened by the increase of investments in
coal power plants across Asia many of which will rely on the supply
of Australian coal." said Catherine Fitzpatrick, Greenpeace
Australia Pacific energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Instead of a fresh sea breeze there is a strange smell, a
mixture of chemicals, garbage and rotten fruits. When we met this
morning at the harbour with the local Greenpeace activists the
problem was obvious before we could even see it: rubbish, rubbish
and more rubbish, simply thrown into the water."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that plastics and various industrial chemicals and
domestic sewage are suffocating the bay's once productive waters,
and joined volunteers from the Manilan "Eco Waste Coalition" in a
clean up.  We filled garbage bag after garbage bag, and hardly made
a dent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the trash was from was plastic from 'single use' sources
(plastic bags, beverage bottles, cups and other items intended to
be used once and thrown away).  Fortunately, we also got a lot of
media attention. Hopefully this will help with the bigger problem -
stopping the trash at its source.&lt;/p&gt;

just some mud the sea had brought in and that would go away
quickly. But than I heard in the radio it was oil."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, August 11, a Petron-chartered single hull vessel
carrying 2.1 million litres of oil sank in Guimaras Strait -
causing the Philippines worst oil spill.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza helped the Philippines Coast Guard survey the
hardest hit area, aided local efforts to contain the spill,
transported clean up equipment and delivered relief supplies
donated for the tens of thousands of affected locals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I saw whole swathes of mangroves with their root systems
covered in the black tar. A clean up of such a tangled mass of
roots would be impossible; the oils will remain trapped within the
roots for years.   It made me so sad as I know mangroves are very
sensitive to oil pollution. These mangroves will probably die over
the next weeks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Dr. Janet Cotter, scientist on board the Esperanza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are very angry with the oil company. We took so much care of
our mangroves. They were really our pride - and now the company has
destroyed it. I think they have to pay a compensation. Not only to
the fishermen but also for the damage on the ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Connie Gamuya, counsellor of La Paz, island of Guimaras&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/greenpeace-needs-your-help"&gt;
Help the people of Guimaras.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rapu Rapu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The proximity of the mine to the sea means that the marine
organisms such as corals are likely to be impacted causing harm to
the fragile coral reef ecosystem. Such impacts on the reef would be
a disaster for marine biodiversity, including the whale shark, and
also local fisheries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Dr. Janet Cotter, scientist onboard the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/aerial-view-of-the-current-min.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Rapu Rapu Island the Esperanza joined a local flotilla of
some 70 traditional outrigger boats in protest against the gold and
silver mining operation.  The mine was reopened in July despite
government investigations, which revealed ongoing leakages of
highly toxic chemicals into the pristine waters of the Albay
Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace science team took water samples tracing water
contamination back to the mine, and our activists entered the
complex and hung a banner calling for the mine to be shut down.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These local people are justifiably outraged. The rich marine
ecosystem they rely on for food and livelihood is being destroyed
for the profit of far off multinational companies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Beau Baconguis, Greenpeace Philippines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action"&gt;Ask
ABN Amro and ANZ, two banks financing this mine, to pull their
funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Apo marine reserve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Apo Island has always been the model of hope for coastal
communities in the Philippines. It demonstrates how reserves can
effectively restore the productivity and biodiversity that once
characterized the seas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Daniel Ocampo, Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25361/colourful-basslets.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Apo, local fishermen used to use dynamite, and other
destructive fishing practices. Then a team from Siliman University
convinced them to try setting up a marine reserve instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the dynamite is history. The marine reserve, carefully
guarded by the local community, supports hundreds of species of
corals - and marine catches have doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If it was not an official reserve some fisherman would go back
to the old destructive methods, I think. We do a lot to educate the
people, especially the children. But it has to be official to make
sure everybody protects the sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--- Jerry Mendez, 39-year-old fisherman and Sea Ranger&lt;/p&gt;

	The genetic engineering industry sank to a new low when it was revealed recently that US company Bayer's field trials of genetically engineered (GE) rice had contaminated rice exports. Japan moved fast and banned the US rice from coming into its ports. The EU quickly followed and placed import restrictions and testing regimes in place.  Now, Greenpeace research has uncovered a new example of contamination of the world's most important staple food. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/products-found-to-contain-ille.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Products found to contain illegal and untested genetically engineered rice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently uncovered, and independently verified, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/IllegalChinaGErice"&gt;
that illegal GE rice from China has contaminated food products&lt;/a&gt;
in France, Germany and the UK. We've notified authorities that the
illegal GE rice poses serious health risks and we're calling upon
European governments to take immediate action to protect
consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace offices and Friends of the Earth in the UK tested
samples of rice products such as vermicelli, rice sticks and other
processed foods. Five positive samples were found containing an
illegal GE organism not approved anywhere in the world. However
this may only be the tip of the iceberg. Rice products are included
in everything from baby food to yoghurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level
responses", said Jeremy Tager, GE rice campaigner, Greenpeace
International. "Consumers should not be left swallowing
experimental GE rice that is risky to their health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illegal GE rice, genetically engineered to be resistant to
insects, contains a protein or fused protein (Cry1Ac) that has
reportedly induced allergic-like reactions in mice. Three
independent scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ScientistStatementHealthConcernsGErice" target="_blank"&gt;issued a statement backing the health concerns we
raised&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International is calling for immediate worldwide
recall, measures to ensure no further contaminated rice enters the
EU and the urgent implementation of a preventative screening system
for countries with high contamination risks. Demanding GE-free
certification for food from countries that grow and produce GE
crops is reasonable, cost effective, and necessary to protect
Europe's consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bayer's illegal GE rice in the US, this recent rice
contamination in China began with field trials; the rice is not
currently approved for commercial growing because of mounting
concerns over its safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innocent consumers again become the victims," says Tager. 
"Once illegal GE crops are in the food chain, removing them takes
enormous effort and cost. It is easier to prevent contamination in
the first place," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that
is grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens
biodiversity and poses unacceptable risks to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=GE_rice_signup"&gt;Sign up for our free e-zine and action alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=GE_rice_donate"&gt;In order to maintain our independence, we don't accept funding from governments or corporations.

	It's a bluefin tuna graveyard, white crosses float next to tuna ranch cages. We end our three month Mediterranean tour back where we started, in Spain, highlighting the desperate state of bluefin tuna stocks.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists from the Rainbow Warrior create a syymbolic "tuna graveyard" with mock crosses inside a tuna ranch in Cartagena, Southeast Spain.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tour that started with the launch of the Greenpeace
tunareport onboard the Esperanza in Barcelona, we've confirmed our
worstfears about the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin
tuna are being plundered, illegal driftnets known as "wallsof
death" continue to be used despite their prohibition and the
rampantoverdevelopment of the Mediterranean coastline is destroying
coastalecosytems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as we showed with the proposal for a network of marine
reserves for the Mediterranean, there is still hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theRainbow Warrior concludes the 2006 tour of the
Mediterranean, we lookback on some of the highlights and many
suprises from the past threemonths. From diving and documenting the
beauty below the surface,confiscating illegal driftnets and
rescuing sailors from sinking boatsto being blockaded by the
fishermen in Marseille, it's certainly been amemorable tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Mediterranean is in desperate need of a sea change
-literally. The large industrial fishing fleets are out of control,
thetuna ranches are out of control, the illegal driftnetters are
out ofcontrol, even the jellyfish are out of control, partly due to

<item><language>en</language><title>Deadly cargo dumped in the Ivory Coast</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ivory-coast-toxic-dumping/</url><text>
	Toxic waste from Europe openly dumped on the streets of an African capital city. Six people dead and thousands requiring medical treatment. The Ivory Coast cabinet resigns but still no one owns up to the dumping. How could this be allowed to happen?
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/public-health-and-protection-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal of the toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast first
came tolight on September 6 when the first casualties where
reported andprotests broke out on the streets against the
government, which wasblamed for allowing the dumping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the wastes are deadly. Four of the six
dead arechildren and 23 people have required hospital treatment so
far. Thefact that the toxic waste was dumped openly on the streets
of a city isshocking enough. The fact that the waste was delivered
by a shipchartered by Trafigura LTD (controlled by Dutch firm
Trafigura BeheerBV), who claimed they thought the waste would be
'properly treated' ina poor African nation raises serious questions
about why they sent itto Africa. The fact that international law
may have been broken makesit a serious scandal that such deadly
incidents still occur today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Back from the past?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We campaigned long and hard for an international ban on the
dumping oftoxic waste by rich countries in poor countries, which
resulted in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt;
Basel Ban in 1998&lt;/a&gt;.  So we want to know how the dumping
occurred, what was dumpedand who is responsible. A &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/toxic-waste-in-abidjan-green/"&gt;
full version of what we know to date&lt;/a&gt; isavailable but here is a
short summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 19 August, a ship called the Probo Koala unloaded a toxic
wasteshipment in Abidjan, the main economic capital of the Ivory
Coast.However it was not until the first week of September that the
incident came tolight. The Ivorian Ministry of Health announced an
extraordinarymeeting that led to the dismissal of its government on
6 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As international and/or local environmental laws may have been
broken,we are calling for a transparent and thorough investigation
by therespective international and local authorities. The facts
behind thisdeadly tragedy in the Ivory Coast remain obscured by the
vesselcharterer, Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to investigate the chain of events, but the lack of
transparency in the shippingindustry as a whole, and specifically
from Trafigura and various portauthorities, are hiding the facts
from the public.Official investigations on the national and
international levels areurgently called for to establish
liabilities, to indicate where nationsare failing to uphold their
international commitments and to make surethis deadly type of
export never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mystery movements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 2 the Probo Koala attempted to unload waste in
Amsterdam.Noting the strong-smelling nature of the waste and
probable toxic nature, harbour authoritiestold the ship that the
waste would be more expensive to dispose of. The ship refused to
pay extra treatment costs and leftAmsterdam. Where the ship went
between the 2 July and 19 August, andwhat it did with its toxic
cargo, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Abidjan the ship unloaded waste supposedly to be treated
by anIvorian waste handling firm. In fact the waste, which appears
toconsist of volatile hydrocarbons, was dumped at 11 sites in the
city.Symptoms reported by those who come in contact with the waste
includerespiratory problems, nausea, dizziness, vomiting (including
throwingup blood), burns and irritation from the toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will anyone take responsibility?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is established where the waste originated in Europe,
thatcountry could be liable to take back the waste. If the toxic
waste wasconsidered regulated under the Basel Convention and bound
for export,the Dutch Authorities could have prevented the ship
leaving with toxicwaste onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is obvious that the crisis could not have happened
without thelocal public and private complicity, the company
Trafigura clearlyshould be the centre of an investigation into any
attempt to takeadvantage of legal loopholes and grey areas to
assess if itdeliberately broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bay wasonce considered one of the most beautiful in the
world, now it is oneof the most polluted.  Sludge, human sewage,
industrial waste and,especially, plain garbage foul the water. 
Much of the garbage isplastic from 'single use' sources - that is
plastic bags, beveragebottles, cups and other items intended to be
used once and thrown away.Most of these plastics come from
land-based sources and are carriedalong deltas of rivers and
estuaries, smothering mangrove trees andother marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines also has some of the bestexamples of communities
protecting their marine resources.  We'llbe visiting two such
places - Donsol and Apo Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Donsol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="continue_slideshow" href="#" name="continue_slideshow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theplankton-rich waters of the municipality of Donsol are known
feedinggrounds for whale sharks. These largest fish of the sea are
celebrityanimals. Time magazine in 2004 called the Donsol whale
shark experiencethe "Best Animal Encounter in Asia". The thousands
of tourists whoflock to Donsol yearly seem to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epicentre of thewhale sharks' activity is undeniably Donsol.
But come migration time,the neighbouring municipalities of Bacon
and Rapu Rapu find themselvesvisited by these gentle giants as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Apo Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knownaround the world as one of the best examples of a
community-managedmarine reserve, Apo Island is a small, steep
volcanic island surroundedby narrow fringing coral reefs. The
waters around it are home to 650species of fish and 400 species of
corals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time,however, when the fish were not so abundant.
Decades ago the islandersused dynamite for fishing, and practised
other unsustainable methods.Eking out a living as a fisherman
became more and more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coralreef protection in Apo Island began informally in 1982
under a MarineConservation Development Program started by Silliman
University in thePhilippines.  At first the local community was
sceptical, so theproject began on a small scale.  As fish catches
improved theislanders became convinced.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, the island communityand local council formalized the
sanctuary, declaring waterssurrounding the island up to 500 metres
from the shore a marine reserve,and a portion of the coast in the
south-eastern part of the island ano-take fish sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community now plays a major rolein protecting their marine
resources in a model we hope will spread toother parts of the
Philippines and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miningoperations on Rapu Rapu island in the Philippines by
Australian companyLaFayette are a ticking time bomb for local
fisheries and the region'scoral reefs and whale sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rapu Rapu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theisland of Rapu Rapu is in many ways similar to Donsol and
ApoIsland.  Rapu Rapu's surrounding waters also teem with
marinelife.  Its locals also depend on the sea for
theirlivelihood.  But there is an important and loomingdifference. 
Rapu Rapu has a large open pit mine - run byAustralian company
Lafayette.  This mine was temporarily closedafter two toxic spills
last year, but recently re-opened despite therecommendation of a
presidential fact finding commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReynaldoCotorno, a Rapu Rapu fisherman who had waded out to fish
on October11th recounted what happened when the first spill reached
theocean.  As he put it, "I was wearing trousers at the time. The
seawater stung as if there were insects, but that was not
it. Perhaps it was the chemicals that caused the fish to die. There
werereally a lot of dead fish, big and small ones together with
shellfish." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the presidential commission determined, another suchspill is
not necessary to demonstrate that mining operations will beseverely
detrimental to Rapu Rapu, and its surrounding waters. Initial
ecological and health studies on the Rapu-Rapu mine warned ofheavy
metal contamination, siltation and other acute and long-termimpacts
on the marine ecosystem, including the complications of acidmine
drainage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, a Greenpeace report revealed that RapuRapu residents
only stand to gain about US$0.04 (PhP2.00) per capitaincome per day
during the mine's seven-year of operation. This amountdoes not even
look into the environmental, health and social costs thatthe local
population will incur from the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islanders knowthat the fate of their community is linked to the
health of theocean.  Thinking of his children, fisherman Cotorno
said, "Inshort, I am against the mine because I am thinking of the
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign the petition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ctk.greenpeace.org/od-en/ctk-letters/get-info?letter%5fid=2189327"&gt;Help Philippines Ocean Defenders resist the mine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=espphilippines"&gt;Donate and become a member today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	(UPDATED) The port of Marseille is refusing to let our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, dock and some French tuna fishermen are in uproar - thanks to our work highlighting widespread overfishing and illegalities in the Mediterranean tuna industry. 
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A large purse seiner comes dangerously close alongside the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="#update"&gt;Jump to update.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SinceMay, the Rainbow Warrior has been documenting the state of
theMediterranean Sea, including the activities of Spanish,
French,Italian, Turkish and Japanese bluefin tuna
fishingvessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found is overfishing on a massivescale, and an industry
that routinely ignores quotas and regulations.An estimated 45,000
tons of tuna was taken from the Mediterranean lastyear - while the
legal quota is only 32,000 tons.  French,Libyan and Turkish tuna
fisherman all stand accused of illegallyfishing over their quotas,
and some French fisherman have even admittedas much to the media.
No wonder the bluefin tuna stock here is in sucha dire state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stephan Beaucher ofGreenpeace France put it, "Leading
scientists and environmental groupsagree that the blue fin tuna
stock is on the verge of collapse in theMediterranean as a result
of over fishing." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The confrontation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becausegovernments and industry won't tackle the issue, we were
taking ourmessage direct to the people of France.  But the
government ofMarseille and the tuna industry don't want our message
heard, and aredoing everything they can to keep us from even coming
intoport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on June 27th, we were granted permissionto dock in
Marseille, but this week that permission was revoked for"technical
and security reasons" (with no furtherexplanation).  As the Rainbow
Warrior approached the port,over 20 industrial fishing vessels
surrounded it.  Our shipdropped anchor about a mile out. Now, we're
ferrying journalists out byboat to talk to them about the sorry
state of the bluefin tuna stock,and the need for marine reserves in
theMediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These fisherman may have dirtysecrets to hide," said Karli
Thomas by phone from the deck of theRainbow Warrior, "But they
won't let them stop us from bringing theplight of the tuna to
light."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="update" href="#" name="update"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE (day 2):  Rainbow Warrior boarded andtowed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25520/industrial-tuna-fishing-ships.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followingan additional confrontation this morning where tuna
fishermen blockadedand boarded the Rainbow Warrior as well as fire
hosing its crew; ourship is now being towed out of France's 12 mile
territorial zone by theFrench authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tuna fishermen are out ofcontrol on the high seas and now
they are out of control in port," saidKarli Thomas, on board the
Rainbow Warrior. "These industrial tunafishermen blockading us need
to take responsibility for their part inthe depleted state of the
Mediterranean tuna fishery and look at thebigger picture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Rainbow Warrior has broken nolaws and the source of the
tension is coming from the French tunafisherman," said Mike Finken,
captain of the Rainbow Warrior. "TheRainbow Warrior is capable of
leaving under its own propulsion and aswe made clear yesterday it
had planned to do so at 6pm today to setsail for Spain to continue
Greenpeace's campaign to raise awareness ofthe threats facing the
Mediterranean Sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomascontinued, "They should support our call for establishment
of a networkof marine reserves to bring about a sustainable,
healthy and productiveMediterranean Sea. It is in the long term
interests of the environmentand all fishing communities, both in
France and the rest of theMediterranean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rainbow Warrior crew weblog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/defendingourmediterranean/"&gt;Updates from the crew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In French&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/france/news/marseille-le-point-a-8h30"&gt;Updates to the story in French.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The biggest names in electronics have just sat their first global exam on their green credentials. Ranked on their use of toxic chemicals and electronic waste (e-waste) policies only Dell and Nokia scraped a barely respectable score while Apple, Motorola and Lenovo flunked the test to finish bottom of the class.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scorecard highlights which of the major electronics companies isdoing the most to remove the worst toxic chemicals from their productsand which companies have good recycling programs for their products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2006/8/green-electronics-guide.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Click here for the ranking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranking is important because the amounts of toxic e-waste isgrowing everyday and it often ends up dumped in the developing world.Reducing the toxic chemicals in products reduces pollution from oldproducts and makes recycling safer, easier and cheaper. Companies withgood recycling schemes help ensure that their products don't end up inthe e-waste yards of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The scorecard will provide a dynamic tool to green the electronicssector by setting off a race to the top. By taking back their discardedproducts, companies will have incentives to eliminate harmfulsubstances used in their products, since this is the only way they canensure safe reuse and recycling of electronic waste," said Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nokia-rank/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-dell-ranki/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt; share the top spot in the ranking. They believe that asproducers they should bear individual responsibility for taking backand reusing or recycling their own-brand discarded products. Nokialeads the way on eliminating toxic chemicals, since the end of 2005 allnew models of mobiles are free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and all newcomponents to be free of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from thestart of 2007. Dell has also set ambitious targets for eliminatingthese harmful substances from their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third place goes to &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-hp-ranking/"&gt; HP&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-erics/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; (4th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-samsung-ra/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; (5th),&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-ranki/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt; (6th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-lg-electro/"&gt; LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt; (7th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-panasonic/"&gt; Panasonic&lt;/a&gt; (8th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-toshiba-ra/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; (9th),&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-fujitsu-si/"&gt; Fujitsu Siemens Computers&lt;/a&gt; (10th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; (11th), &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-acer-ranki/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; (12th) and&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-motorola-r/"&gt; Motorola&lt;/a&gt; (13th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-lenovo-ran/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; is in bottom position. It earns points for chemicals managementand providing some voluntary product take back programmes, but it needsto do better on all criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is disappointing to see &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank/"&gt; Apple ranking&lt;/a&gt; so low in the overall guide.They are meant to be world leaders in design and marketing, they shouldalso be world leaders in environmental innovation." said Kruszewska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have the opportunity to move towards a greener ranking as theguide will be updated every quarter. However penalty points will bededucted from overall scores if we find a company lying, practisingdouble standards or other corporate misconduct. For now, companies arescored solely on information publicly available on their globalwebsites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a average score of only 4/10 it is clear that the electronicsindustry has a long way to go before it can make any claims to being agreen industry.&lt;/p&gt;

	John Lundberg, a professional cropcircle maker talks about his latest work, a giant question mark in a maize field in Mexico and working with us.

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/mexico-crop-circle1.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists protest against the contamination of Mexico's maize supply from genetically engineered maize.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For years I'd thought that crop circles would be an ideal
medium forpromoting Greenpeace's genetic engineering (GE) campaign.
The cropcircles generate an alien mystique, encouraging people to
consider theunknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/"&gt;
GE campaign&lt;/a&gt; aims to prevent alien organisms from contaminating
ourplants and food, while raising awareness of the unknown
consequencesthat could arise from such material entering the food
chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiscombination of mystery, creativity and an underlying message
perfectlyreflects the work that Greenpeace is doing worldwide. It
was alsoembodied in the formation we created for them - a 65 meter
(200 feet)circle with a question mark at its centre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why a question mark?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Forthousands of years, maize (corn) has been an essential food
for thepeople of Mexico; it also plays an integral part in their
culture andreligion. Unfortunately, in recent years the maize has
been tainted byGE varieties entering the country and being planted
by unaware farmers.As a result, normally GE-free maize is showing
signs of geneticcontamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question mark conveys a simple message -contamination is
happening, but nobody knows exactly where it is takingplace, nor
where it could lead for the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after our crop circle creation we were transported to a
tiny village called Cuanajo in the state of Michoacan. A
celebration was held to honour the regions GE free status. The
festival was an amazing cultural experience, each type of maize has
a purpose. Maize for tortillas, tamales, atoles, pozole, animal
feed and also to create handcrafts which they sell in market
stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting this precious diversity is paramount for the people,
regional government, scientists and environmental groups who have
all worked together to cement the region as GE free. Other
surrounding regions are also interested in following this example
to create their own GE free zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themore I find out about the issues surrounding GE, especially
withinMexico, the happier I am to have been involved in this
project. Withliterally thousands of different strains of maize in
Mexico, it'svitally important for both its people, and the rest of
the world, tokeep the seeds clean and maintain their variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-mexico/"&gt;Greenpeace in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;
was a rewarding and fun experience - even duringthe rainy season!
Circlemakers hope to continue our relationship withGreenpeace and I
also hope that Mexico can successfully rid itself ofgenetic

&lt;p&gt;Theformations crafted anonymously by John and his collaborators
havecreated headlines around the world. Eventually Circlemakers
began to beapproached by companies asking if they could create crop
circles to beused in TV shows, movies, music videos, adverts and PR
stunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They'vecreated crop circle in the UK, US, New Zealand, Japan,
acrosscontinental Europe and now in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

	An inspection conducted today by Greenpeace scientists and government officials showed that toxic pollution from the Lafayette mine would clearly affect the coastal and marine ecosystems of Rapu Rapu Island. Our activists also entered the mine, hanging a banner of their conveyor belt calling for the operation to be shut down.

            Greenpeace activists hang a banner at the conveyor belt of Lafayette mine, Rapu Rapu Island, Philippines. Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza is in the Philippines to campaign for the shut down of the gold and silver mining operations of Lafayette on Rapu-Rapu Island, Philippines, which discharged highly toxic chemicals into the pristine waters of Albay Gulf.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water samples taken from a creek, leading out from the mine and
into the sea, showed very high levels of toxic metals such as
cadmium, copper and zinc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extremely high levels of heavy metals found in the samples
are toxic to human, plants and animals. Marine organisms are likely
to be impacted due to the proximity of the mine to the sea, causing
harm to the coral reef. The impacts of such would be a disaster for
marine biodiversity, including the whale shark, and local
fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same mine that was temporarily closed after two
toxic spills last year. A presidential fact finding commission
recommended shutting the mine down permanently.  But in July this
year, a 30-day trial run commenced licensed by the government to
see if Lafayette could operate without contaminating the sea.
During the test run, several toxic leaks occurred. Residents have
since reported more fish kills in the creeks leading out from the
mine into Albay Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;At stake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace sampled the Mirikpitik Creek, one of the creeks
leading out of the mine premises, at the beginning of August and
found out that it is absolutely affected in its lower stretch by
acid mine drainage (AMD). Ongoing exposure of these metals in
dissolved forms is deadly to the aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unspoiled waters, seagrass beds and mangroves of Albay Gulf
form a perfect rich fishing ground for local fishermen. Dolphins,
sea turtles, egrets, and purple herons are a common sight in this
area. Marine turtles are also found in the Albay Gulf, and whale
sharks around Rapu Rapu. The Lafayette mine is surely a threat to
the survival of these species and also of the people whose
livelihood depends on the rich marine ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders/take-action"&gt;Help Rapu Rapu locals defend the ocean: Tell banks financing this mine to pull their funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Ocean Defender!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/ocean-defenders"&gt;Join us on our journey, and take action to Defend Our Oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirate fishing vessel arrested</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirates-arrested/</url><text>
	We have arrested a pirate fishing vessel stealing fish off the coast of Guinea, taking a Guinean Navy officer and a fisheries inspector and working with crew from the Esperanza and the Environmental Justice Foundation.  Our onboard campaigner, Sarah Duthie, said, "Today we found one pirate – but we know there is a fleet of them out here and in every other ocean, stealing fish every day.”

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first light this morning, the Greenpeace helicopter flew over
agroup of fishing vessels 60 miles off the coast of Guinea. One was
noton the list of ships authorized to fish. An inflatable boat
waslaunched from the Greenpeace ship M.Y Esperanza, taking a
Guinean Navyofficer and a fisheries inspector with crew from
Greenpeace and theEnvironmental Justice Foundation on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After confirming the ship, the Lian Run No 14 - one of afamily
of Chinese vessels observed in the area - had no license, theship
was arrested. The Esperanza will now escort her to Conakry andhand
her over to officials on shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain of the Lian Run No 14 claimed documentation
waslodged in Las Palmas - the fish laundering capital of the world.
Inaddition, all the boxes being used to pack the stolen fish bore
thenames of other vessels, proving that even licensed vessels
collaboratewith the pirates to sell illegally caught fish on the
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish boxes with the names of seven other vessels were found
onboard the Lian Run No 14, proving how licensed vessels are
packingtheir boxes with illegal catch from the Lian Run No 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that they had boxes on board destined for Europe
andclaimed to be represented in Las Palmas shows a clear link
between thefood being stolen from Africa and the fish being served
on the dinnertables of Europe," said Helene Bours of the
Environmental JusticeFoundation.&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Esperanza tackles pollution in the Philippines, our ship the Arctic Sunrise continues our expedition's battle against pirates.  Activists demanded inspection of Russian-flagged reefer 'Mumrinskiy' in the Netherlands, suspected of carrying illegal cod bound for European dinner plates.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Stopping the Russian ship Mumrinskiy from unloading a potentially illegal cod shipment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our activists have stopped the Russian flagged reefer
"Mumrinskiy" fromoffloading their cargo in Eemshaven, the
Netherlands.  We alsopainted STOP PIRATE FISHING on the side and
blocked the vessel fromunloading  cargo.  We havegood reason to
suspect that the vessel is carrying illegal codfrom the Barents
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Barents Sea is home to one of the world's last relatively
healthycod populations, but even this stock is now being heavily
exploited.According to estimates from the International Council for
theExploration of the Sea (ICES) 37 percent of all cod captured in
theBarents Sea in 2005 was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Oceans Campaigner Farah Obaidullah explains.  "The fishing
industry has heavily plundered the cod stock in the NorthSea and
now they are starting to overexploit the stocks in the BarentsSea,"
she says. "Illegalfishing seriously undermines efforts to conserve
and manage fish stocksand it poses a severe threat to the whole
Barents ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mumrinskiy's dodgy history&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do we suspect the Mumrinskiy?  This vessel has a clear
history of illegal operations, includingtranshipment of fish from
blacklisted vessels, ignoring commands fromNorwegian Authorities
and falsifying documents tohide illegally caught fish. The
Mumrinskiy has often transitedthrough international waters
circumventing the Norwegian ExclusiveEconomic Zone (EEZ), thereby
avoiding inspection on her way from theBarents Sea to EU ports. (&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/mumrinksiy/" target="_blank"&gt;Read the fact file and see a map of her latest
voyages here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;EU ports: laundering dirty cod&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frequent tactic trawlers use in the Barents Sea to
under-report theirdaily catches is to tranship parts of their match
unreported to reefervessels like the "Mumrinskiy". These reefers
then land the stolen fishin Dutch ports where landing documents
with Russian data are notverified and the fish enters unchecked on
to the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a scandal that Russian reefers use Dutch harbours to
laundertheir illegal fish", says Obaidullah. "The only way to stop
illegal codfrom ending up on our plates is to carry out thorough
inspections andconfirm with the relevant authorities that the catch
is legal before itcan be offloaded in Holland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is working on the North andBaltic Sea as part
of the Defending Our Oceansexpedition to highlight the wonders and
the environmental threats tothe world's oceans and to campaign for
the establishment of marinereserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/mumrinskiy-background/"&gt;
Stronger suspicion: more information about the trawlers that
Mumrinskiy carries fish from this time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today, Joaquin Nava, the Governor of the Philippine island hardest hit by a 350,000 litre oil spill, issued a desperate plea for help:"We can only watch in horror how an oil spill can undo in a few days our initiatives which have taken decades to implement. We need all the support we can get."

        &lt;p&gt;
            A group of local fisherman from BrgyTando Village collect oil from beaches by hand. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 26,000 people who rely on fishing have lost their
livelihood. More than 1,100 hectares (2,400 acres) of marine
reserve has been destroyed - along with beach resorts, seaweed
farms and mangrove forests.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;  The Esperanza has arrived at the scene of the
oil spill, and unloaded relief supplies.  Philippines Coast Guard
informs that the number of people affected has risen to 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Esperanza enroot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying a science and documentation team, the Esperanza is now
on its way to the site of the spill.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Philippine Coast Guard is enlisting Greenpeace in this
short but vital impacts assessment work," said Commander Joseph M.
Coyme of the Philippine Coast Guard at a recent press conference.
"The information that Greenpeace and their partner scientists
provide will give us solid basis in continuing our oil spill
containment and mitigation work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same press conference, Von Hernandez, Campaign Director
of Greenpeace Southeast Asia emphasized that it will take years to
rehabilitate the affected areas and communities.  He then said, "We
reiterate our call on the government to make Petron and its
partners accountable for all the costs associated with this
disaster".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza will join the Coast Guard in a joint visual survey
of the hardest hit area.  It is also transporting clean-up
containment equipment and relief goods donated by the ABS-CBN
Foundation and friends of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
