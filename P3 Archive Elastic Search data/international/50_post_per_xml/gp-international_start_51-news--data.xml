	Zara, the world’s largest clothing retailer, today announced a commitment to go toxic-free following nine days of intense public pressure. This win belongs to the fashion-lovers, activists, bloggers and denizens of social media. This is people power in action.

            Volunteers dressed as 'revolting mannequins' at Zara stores around the world on Saturday.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigners began a dialogue with Zara (a brand within the Inditex group) in 2011 about eliminating releases of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and clothes. But it wasn't until this week that the fast-fashion giant caught on to the urgent need to solve its toxic pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara has now committed to eliminate all discharge of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. And they're going to get rid of some of the worst chemicals, such as PFCs, even sooner. As a significant user of PFCs, Zara's commitment to eliminate this chemical group by the end of 2015 is a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox commitment announced today covers Zara and the seven other brands in the Inditex group: Pull &amp;amp; Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitment is good news for the environment, but also a breakthrough for the public's right to know what is being released into our waterways. Zara says that by the end of 2013 at least 100 of its suppliers in the Global South (including at least 40 in China) will publicly disclose data about their releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment. The open data will be chemical-by-chemical, facility-by-facility and at least year-by-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Climbers unfurled a giant banner at Zara's store and Swiss head office in Geneva, tweeting live from their phones to ZARA and supporters. 

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/the-toxic-tale-behind-your-clothing/blog/43044/"&gt;launched the Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt; globally with a fashion show and press conference in Beijing. Related images and comments began to rise like a spring tide on social networks within hours of the story breaking. Zara's Facebook Page quickly filled with comments from fans calling on the company to Detox. Thousands of people began to share their desire for “fashion without pollution!” and demands for Zara to Detox on Twitter and Sina Weibo, China's leading microblogging site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see who's commenting about the campaign &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/zara/Detox-ZARA-Social-Media-Buzz/"&gt;on Twitter and Weibo in one place&lt;/a&gt; – people around the world speaking out in a dozen languages to a combined reach of more than 7.1m followers. On Twitter alone there were at least 43,800 mentions of Zara and the Detox campaign this week. More than 300,000 people signed up to join the campaign to Detox Zara, and many tens of thousands of people emailed and tweeted directly to the company for an ambitious Detox commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jWhLN0Ag_Dg" width="601" height="338" border="0" style="border:0px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/fashion-without-pollution-so-hot-right-now/blog/43128/"&gt;700 Greenpeace volunteers in 20 countries&lt;/a&gt; were out at Zara stores on Saturday. In the days before, climbers and other activists delivered the Detox message at Zara flagship stores and HQ buildings in Hong Kong, Budapest, Geneva, Hamburg and Madrid. Photos and videos of the actions have been trending on Twitter for days for searches like “Zara” and “Fashion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara's commitment to act more transparently is a milestone in the way clothing is manufactured. It's an important step in providing local communities, journalists and officials with the information they need to ensure that local water supplies are not turned into public sewers for industry. Zara's transparency revolution will be key to ensuring that as brands commit to Detox they then really follow through on achieving zero discharges by 2020. With so many businesses engaging in greenwashing, it's important for consumers to know who they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara now joins &lt;strong&gt;Nike, Adidas, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/Clickers-and-Stickers-Make-HM-Detox/"&gt;H&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/full-marks-for-marks-spencer/blog/42722/"&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/important-step-down-the-catwalk-to-toxic-free/blog/37928/"&gt;C&amp;amp;A and Li-Ning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; who have also committed to Detox but other top clothing companies still need to respond to the urgency of the situation and Detox. We tested &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/toxic-threads/"&gt;clothing items from 20 leading brands&lt;/a&gt; this year and found hazardous chemicals in them that break down in the environment to form toxic pollution. But by working with their suppliers and switching to non-hazardous alternatives, the clothing companies can become part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while Zara is a big fish, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation before our work will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fashion-lovers, activists, environmentalists, bloggers and celebrities will be back for more - toxic brands be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Here's how: &lt;/strong&gt;Watch, Like, and Share this animation aimed at getting the fashion industry to stop discharging hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	The world's #1 sportswear brand, Nike, has accepted our Detox challenge: today it has officially committed to eliminating all hazardous chemicals across its entire supply chain, and the entire life-cycle of its products by 2020. This is a major win for our campaign to protect the planet’s precious water, and create a toxic-free future.

&lt;p&gt;Nike's announcement comes just five weeks into our&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/detox"&gt; Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which began when we launched the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;" report, revealing commercial links between major clothing brands - including Nike, Puma and Adidas - and suppliers responsible for releasing hazardous chemicals into Chinese rivers. We challenged these brands to champion a toxic-free future by committing to work with their suppliers and remove these toxic chemicals from their clothes and China's rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nike sets a new pace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma was first&lt;/a&gt; to break away from the pack, opening up an impressive lead by announcing that it would go toxic-free. Puma's commitment to remove all hazardous chemicals from its entire product-portfolio must have left their competition wondering how they were going to raise their game. Now, Nike and Puma are the front-runners, and Adidas is far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike also agreed (&lt;a href="http://www.nikebiz.com/media/pr/2011/08/17_zero_discharge.html" target="_blank"&gt;their full statement&lt;/a&gt;) to address the issue of the public's "right to know" by ensuring full transparency about the chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The more the public knows about the toxic chemicals spilling out of these factories, the more the pressure to stop them polluting will increase. The importance of this cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sportswear giant has also promised to use its influence, knowledge and experience to bring about widespread elimination of hazardous chemicals from the clothing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;Detox at the Barcelona vs Real Madrid match&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tonight projected messages including, “Water Pollution Is Not Fair Play” and "The World Needs More Champions. Is Adidas All In?" to the almost 100,000 fans attending the Spanish Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (sponsored by Adidas) at the Nou Camp Stadium, in Barcelona, Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can Adidas top that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to clean up its act, Nike is showing hints of greatness - but we will be closely monitoring the company’s implementation plan, due to be published by 18 October. And just because Nike’s taking the lead shouldn’t mean Adidas or other clothing companies can simply throw in the towel. The game is still on and they should be hot on Nike's heels to become champions of a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas have a lot of ground to make up. If they want to be considered contenders, they need to get in the game by committing to zero discharge and really take the lead by developing a new culture of transparency throughout the clothing industry and helping others stop the release of hazardous chemicals currently used during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's like Green My Apple again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind the Detox campaign comes from a year-long investigation into the textile industry's water pollution problem in China, where vital research helped us to connect the dots and link hazardous chemicals and their impacts in waterways like the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas to textile factories and international clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these brands, one group stood out as the most likely to become champions of a toxic-free future: Leading sports clothing companies like Nike and Adidas. Not only do they like to market themselves as leaders and innovators, they also have the size and influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate the use and release of these hazardous chemicals from the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="366" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkou6xAb6Rw" width="590"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enormous task of changing the toxic practices of an entire industry can be extremely daunting, so we went in search of a potential leader with the will to change itself and the influence to change others. Much as we did during &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;our Green My Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was vital to engage with innovative and proactive industry leaders - the sort of companies who are willing to put their slogans into action and &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that "impossible is nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much encouraging by Greenpeace and Apple aficionados, in March 2009 Apple become the first laptop maker to eliminate toxic poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). For now we have only commitments from Nike and Puma, though they are on the right track and deserve recognition for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bearing witness works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox campaign kicked off when our mysterious XM3N &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/xm3n-mannequins-reveal-their-mission-to-chall/blog/35757/"&gt;mannequins finally revealed their mission&lt;/a&gt; to clean up China's rivers. Their message was spread by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8OB68YeMmc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;our video&lt;/a&gt; – watched and shared by 100s of 1000s of Greenpeace supporters and sports lovers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people really started to get involved and the game was well and truly on. Actions from &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/es/noticias/Greenpeace-desafia-a-Adidas-y-Nike-a-liderar-un-futuro-libre-de-toxicos---/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/Nieuws_2011/Reusachtig-actie-T-shirt-aan-hoofdkantoor-Nike/" target="_blank"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/photosvideos/photos/Activistas-de-Greenpeace-cuelgan-los-trapos-sucios-de-Nike-y-Adidas-en-la-plaza-de-Callao-de-Madrid/"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; – including a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/hundreds-strip-to-challenge-nike-and-adidas-t/blog/35853/"&gt;world wide striptease&lt;/a&gt; – made sure the world’s biggest brands couldn’t ignore the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further pressure to perform was piled on by world’s media as the story ran far and wide, from New York to China and Brazil to the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/environmentalists-raise-awareness-with-coordinated-striptease-2326010.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. In Hong Kong&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our exhibit helped bring the message to the street where passers-by took a moment to put their demands for Detox in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people signed our petition to the CEOs of Nike and Adidas, many thousands of people have tweeted and shared the campaign on social networks and blogs, submitted logo designs, or contributed campaign ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Adidas have a tough act to follow, and everybody's watching.&lt;/p&gt;

	Levi Strauss &amp; Co. today committed to go toxic-free. Why? Because you and hundreds of thousands of other people demanded that Levi’s “Go Forth and Detox”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest denim brand joins ten other clothing companies that have made &lt;a href="/detox"&gt;credible commitments to Detox&lt;/a&gt;, including the world's largest fashion retailer, Zara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi's commitment comes just eight days after we launched our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Toxics-reports/Toxic-Threads-Under-Wraps/"&gt;“Toxic Threads: Under Wraps” report&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, and screened a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/because-we-fight-for-life/blog/43359/"&gt;documentary about a family&lt;/a&gt; struggling to hold factories in the region to account for the pollution they are causing, including suppliers of brands like Levi's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is living up to its claims of being a leader. Competitors that have so far failed to take responsibility for the pollution created along their entire supply chain are looking increasingly exposed. These include familiar big brands names such as Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A change of direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href="http://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Levi-Greenpeace-Detox-Solution-Commitment.pdf"&gt;commitment from Levi's&lt;/a&gt; is great news for people power and the environment. Levi's will begin requiring its largest suppliers (each with multiple facilities) in China, Mexico and elsewhere in the Global South to disclose pollution data as early as the end of June 2013. This means that's those living near all these facilities gain crucial access to information about discharges into their local environment – a basic right that up to this stage they had been denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than use hazardous chemicals in the first place, Levi's will look for non-hazardous alternatives. This is a bold move away from its previous position, which was focused on managing rather than eliminating hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition, the company has embraced the precautionary principle, which will be fundamental to shift the entire industry towards the adoption of non-hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toxic-free fashion is a trend to last the seasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 people have joined the Detox campaign since we re-launched in November, demanding toxic-free fashion and clean water. Fashionistas, activists, designers and bloggers took action on Twitter and Weibo, spreading news about the industry's toxic addiction and reaching many millions of friends and followers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Zara committed to Detox, then Mango and Esprit, as people around the world made their voices heard. Levi's was next on the shopping list, and in just eight days hundreds of thousands of people had called on the brand to match its bold proclamations with real actions. Activists and volunteers also took to the street in over 20 countries to take the message directly to the brand's customers and to speak with the staff working in their stores, who sent the message back to Levi's HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has again shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while 11 top brands have now committed to Detox, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help spur on the next success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know brands like Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret monitor social media as closely as they monitor traditional media, and every time you like, share, comment on, or promote this video, it increases the pressure on these companies to change their ways: to stop poisoning rivers in the countries where their products are made, and stop shipping hazardous chemicals all over the world in their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A toxic-free world is possible. Together we can help create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our electronics campaigners are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/ces" target="_blank"&gt;blogging from the Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; (CES 2010) in Las Vegas January 7-10. Their mission: To cut through the greenwash, and highlight product ranges on the market which really are free of hazardous chemicals like PVC (vinyl) plastic and brominated flame retardants (BFR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CES is a major trade show where electronics companies come to demonstrate new products and jostle for industry media attention (which these days includes many technology blogs like &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;). Though it is not open to the public, CES say they expect over 140,000 attendees -- that's a lot of consumer electronics industry people in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first"&gt;In 2010, we should see significant developments, with products free of PVC and BFRs in the PC and TV markets. Any company failing to achieve this goal is taking a big gamble with its green reputation. On a positive note, it's good to see non-ranked companies beyond the PC and TV sectors, like Cisco, committing to eliminate these harmful &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics 14th Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; SonyEricsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; lead the way for product ranges free of the worsthazardous substances with &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/HP-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; HP&lt;/a&gt; following their lead. HP just released theCompaq 8000f Elite business desktop, its first completely PVC and BFRfree product, at CES 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/dell-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and LG Electronics (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;pick up penalty points in the Guide&lt;/a&gt; for failing to follow through on a promised phase-out of toxics in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies in our ranking guide had pledged to remove &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/" target="_blank"&gt;toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic and BFRs&lt;/a&gt; from their product range by the end of 2009, which would have meant a greater show of greener, toxic-free products for visitors to see at the CES. But, for now, it's a no show for these companies, who have delayed their phase-out to 2011 or beyond. No doubt they won't mention their backtracking to journalists and bloggers they meet at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's all the concern about toxic chemicals and e-waste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste and the wider community are exposed to significant health risks. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources, as routinely takes place in the backyards of China, India and much of the global South, can form dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumers want green, not greenwash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronics companies have been moving their "environmental information" links higher and higher on product information webpages in the four years since our first &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Green Electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is only greenwash though, and &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; informed consumers can tell the difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/news/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple cleared the final hurdle&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic, making it the first company to completely eliminate hazardous BFRs and PVC in its computer systems. Pressure from thousands of Apple lovers and advocates turned thecompany green in the time it took to go from iMac G5 (2006) to iMac Aluminum (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for a little less conversation and a lot more action on removing toxic chemicals." That's what our electronics campaigner, CaseyHarrell, is saying at CES. Apple, Sony Ericsson and Nokia are winning this game and HP is catching up, but the lack of action from other companies is ensuring that customers and the environment are still losing out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ban the toxic stuff for good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies see their scores reduced in this edition of the Guide with the bar being raised on hazardous substances. Having endorsed the precautionary principle, companies now need to actively support bans on PVC, BFRs and chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs) during the revision of the European Union's &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electronics Directive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies need to support legislative bans to ensure a consistent phase out of PVC and BFRs across all electronic products," said Iza Kruszewska Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "Sony Ericsson and Apple are already calling on EU institutions to support such a ban. Other big players like HP and Dell, who have remained silent so far, and Acer need to ensure the ban is passed in the European Union parliament."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia leads the ranking, with a score of 7.3 out of 10. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; follows closely, and is the only company to score full marks on all the toxic chemicals criteria. In third place is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toshiba-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, but it risks losing points if it fails to meet its commitment to market new models of all its consumer electronics products that are free of PVC and BFRs by 1 April 2010. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; comes in fourth place, while Apple rises from ninth place to fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nintendo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; continues to languish at the bottom of theranking. Sony is rewarded for its reported 17 percent reduction ingreenhouse gas emissions over the period 2000-2008, with renewableenergy now accounting for 8 percent of the total energy purchasedglobally each year by the company, up from 2.5 percent a year ago. Italso gains for the reported use of 17,000 tons of recycled plasticsannually in various products, representing 10 percent of all plasticsused in the 2008 financial year. Almost 90 percent of this recycledplastic was post-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung twitter petition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung drops dramatically from second place to a tied seventh place for failing to eliminate BFRs in all its products by January 2010. With only its latest models of mobile phones free of toxic substances, it has set January 2011 as the deadline for eliminating them from new models of its notebooks and still has no definitive timeline for removing them from its TVs and household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Samsung's marketing people are touting their wares at CES, we'll be calling them out &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;on twitter with this petition&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;petition @Samsungtweets to follow Apple SonyEricsson and HP, and eliminate harmful chemicals like PVC &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;http://act.ly/1l1&lt;/a&gt; RT to sign #actly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What we're saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now stand at a 'climate crossroads'. We can go down the road of renewable energy and smart efficient use of energy, keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change or we can keep blundering on in the same direction into a fossil-fuelled future of extreme weather, drastic water shortages and desperate climate refugees. We cannot afford to take a wrong turn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this while phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear and without the use of unproven 'techno-fixes' like carbon capture and storage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Tara Buakamsri, Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our global energy concept means, that the investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a range of 300-350 billion dollars per year - almost equal to the amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To shift this money and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030, which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Blair nuclear announcement scuppered</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/blair-nuclear-announcement-scu/</url><text>
	Greenpeace climbers scuppered Tony Blair's nuclear announcement by delaying the UK Prime Minister's planned pro-nuclear speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/protestcbilondon.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/protestcbilondon.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The British Prime Minister gets a message from Greenpeace: no nukes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace climbers scaled the ceiling above the speaker'spodium holding banners saying 'nuclear - wrong answer' and thendropping down 'radioactive' confetti, preventing Blair from speaking inthe main gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech has been widely promoted by Blair'sspin doctors as being a vehicle for announcing a further energy review- and for Blair to indicate his personal support for more nuclear powerstations being built across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Tindale Director ofGreenpeace UK said, "Today Blair is trying to launch a new nuclear ageand we are here to stop him. Nuclear power is not the answer to climatechange - it's costly, dangerous and a terrorist target."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Justthree years ago Blair conducted the biggest energy review in 60 years -which concluded renewable energy and energy efficiency, not nuclear, isthe way forward. Today's new review is simply a smokescreen for pushinghis new-found enthusiasm for nuclear power. It's like Iraq all overagain Blair makes his mind up then tries to spin his decision to theBritish people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2005/11/nuclearwronganswer.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real solution to climate change and energysecurity is a mix of efficient, safe and clean energy technologies likewind, wave, and solar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded, "Nuclear power is simply adangerous red herring in this debate. Even if the UK replaced all 23 ofits operating reactors, we would only save 10 percent of our carbonemissions. In contrast the 56 billion pounds of tax-payers money beingused to fund the clean up of the UK's current nuclear sites could buyand install enough wind turbines to meet 20 percent of the UK'selectricity needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear power: wrong answer to climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclearpower has justifiably had a bad press in recent years. It's expensiveto the point of being uneconomic without massive government subsidies,produces dangerous radioactive wastes, and the consequences of aserious accident or terrorist attack on a nuclear plant could bedevastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry claims that nuclear reactors emit virtually no CO2 at the point of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delvea little deeper though, and the logic of this pro-nuclear argumentbegins to unravel. While it's true that most nuclear reactors do notemit carbon (although some nuclear plants actually do release CO2 gasbecause it is used for cooling), they are a small part of a nuclearfuel chain which most certainly does. The preparation of uranium forthe reactor involves a host of CO2 -emitting processes, including:mining and milling the ore; fuel enrichment and fuel-rod fabrication.Then there's the construction of the power station itself. At the otherend there's reactor decommissioning and the treatment, storage,transport and disposal of nuclear waste. All of this involves CO2emissions, which in some areas - such as fuel enrichment - aresignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this whole life-cycle is taken intoconsideration, the claim that nuclear power is a 'carbon-free'alternative to current fossil-fuelled power stations doesn't stand up.That's one of the reasons that the Kyoto treaty negotiations rejectedcarbon credits for nuclear power plants. The most recent studiesindicate that, for the richest uranium ores, CO2 emissions across thenuclear cycle are about 33 percent that of fossil-fuel plants. So farso good - but the fact is that very little uranium ore is of sufficientquality to produce such a result. Poor grades of ore have a content ofless than 0.02 percent uranium-235 (this is the uranium isotope whichis necessary to sustain the chain reaction in fuel in a nuclear powerplant). As the high grade ores are used up, the industry will becomeincreasingly dependent on lower grade ores - which will mean using moreand more energy to 'enrich' the level of uranium-235 in the fuel to alevel where it can be used in a reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Uranium is not a renewable resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knownuranium reserves will last for roughly 50 years at present consumptionrates, but the 438 plants operating world-wide produce only 16 percentof global requirements. If the world's entire electricity needs were tobe met by nuclear power, then reserves of high-grade uranium ore wouldbe used up within three to four years. Some estimates predict thatusing the remaining poorer ores in nuclear reactors could produce moreCO2 emissions than burning fossil fuels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a seriouslong-term energy source, nuclear power is a non-starter. But it haspowerful vested interests behind it which are sucking up funding thatwould be better spent on renewable solutions and energy conservation.As in the 1950s when the first generation of nuclear plants wereconceived, governments seem mesmerized by the glamour of nuclear power,and blinded to its obvious drawbacks. Any attempt to positionmainstream nuclear production as a solution to climate change would bea massive miscalculation, just at the time when we need to focus allour attention on the real solutions - energy conservation and renewablesources like wind, tidal and solar.&lt;/p&gt;

	The first milestone of the Copenhagen Accord came and went, and with it no sign of the kind of targets for cutting global warming pollution needed to steer the world off the path towards catastrophic climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists called "Climate Shame" on Heads of State in as they fail to deliver a Real Deal in Copenhagen
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the Copenhagen Accord could possibly be a useful political declaration was if its January 31st deadline had been met with tougher new greenhouse gas emission targets. After all, its stated goal is supposed to be to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But governments tried to greenwash their failure at the UN Copenhagen climate summit by merely repeating existing targets and dressing them up as action. So far, these targets will fail to hold global warming to below 3 degrees C; an increase which threatens to have horrendous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it take for politicians to realise that time is running out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Masks off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious to everyone - even those who tried hard to pretend the world was saved after Copenhagen - that the Accord is a document barely worth the paper it is written on. It was put together quickly by politicians hoping to pass for leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving face - that was its purpose. Our climate was the least of politicians' concerns then, and obviously still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, Bernhard Obermayr, Head of the Climate and Energy Campaign, Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe said, "Today is the day for an obituary about the Copenhagen Accord's ability to protect the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where we stand now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do governments avoid the 2 degree C threshold from being breached?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret. By 2020, industrialised nations must cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels and developing countries need to reduce their projected growth in emissions by 15-30%. Further, the industrialised world needs to provide developing countries with new and additional funding of at least USD 140 billion annually to support clean energy and other mitigation activities, forest protection and adaptation. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; To give this package teeth, it must be set in a legally binding agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to Copenhagen, 15 million people called for a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty. We're still waiting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Associating' - since the Accord is not legally binding and was noted but not adopted by the UN Conference, associated is the best they can do - with the Accord, the European Union repeated its target of a 20 percent emissions cut against 1990 levels - old news, and only half of what is required. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/emission-targets-us-china-021209/"&gt; The US is sticking by the meagre 17 percent of 2005 levels&lt;/a&gt; but making that dependent of domestic legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the absence of leadership by the rich industrialised world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the lowest-lying Pacific island nations last week said it's going to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2020. Lying only 2 meters above sea level, the Marshall Islands is in danger of being washed off the map. In other words, the industrialised world has been shamed for its inaction by one of the most vulnerable nations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting the "dead" in "deadline"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 31st was a political deadline. We are approaching other deadlines though; ones that nature decides on and which politicians will not be able to talk their way out of. If global warming gets to the point where 'tipping points' are passed there will be no way for us to backtrack and undo the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-third-degree/"&gt; While three degrees of warming would likely be catastrophic.&lt;/a&gt; But even 2 degrees C risks possible partial, but irreversible deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet and even the West Antarctic ice sheet, that could eventually lead to sea level rise of several meters. Half-of-one degree more could lead to 20-80% loss of the Amazon rainforest and countless species that live in the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the poorest and those least responsible for causing the problem who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The fight for survival of millions of people around the world and countless species of plants and animals is the brutal reality as permafrost melts, sea levels rise, tropical storms batter continents and once-fertile lands battle with floods or drought. But climate change knows no borders - we will all feel its impacts. It threatens economies, environments, human society and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

	If you live in a developed country, you’re pretty well insulated from climate change. Shifts in weather patterns, heavier rainfall, gradually rising sea levels and temperature increases – at the moment western society absorbs these changes without us really noticing much difference. But for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, living on the front line of climate change, shifts in the planet’s behaviour are much more obvious.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nenet girl, Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nenet people of the Yamal peninsula are nomadic reindeer herders who live within the Arctic circle on the northern coast of Siberia. In summer they graze their herds on the tundra of the peninsula, and in winter as the ground freezes they move south to milder parts of the Siberian steppes. They use the frozen surface of the landscape to cross the numerous freshwater lakes and marshes of the peninsula, which in summer they catch fish in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things are changing. The Arctic is the most sensitive area of the planet to climate change. While global average temperature has risen by around 0.8 degrees, some parts of Siberia have warmed by as much as 5 or 6. And so the Nenet have noticed the ground is freezing later and later in the year - and in some places, not freezing at all. The reindeer herders have to wait longer and longer before they can move their animals south across frozen ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, on the frontiers of the world, the warming of Siberia is already threatening a way of life that has remained fairly constant for thousands of years. It's not only that the Nenet have to move later in the year - many of the freshwater lakes that dot the landscape are leaking away as the frozen walls of earth that contain the water melt, and collapse. And so the Nenet are also losing the fishing that provides one of their main sources of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/melting-permafrost-in-yamal-pe.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eternal ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siberia is a landscape that's underpinned by frozen ground, called 'permafrost', but this ground is beginning to thaw. Off the coast, whole islands made of permafrost are literally disappearing as the arctic sea washes away the rapidly melting land. Melting permafrost is causing roads, pipelines and foundations to collapse across the country. Every year, there's an increase in the area of ground that melts in summer and the area that doesn't refreeze in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem in the Arctic. This melt has global implications, because it's going to speed up climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permafrost is like a giant frozen compost heap - full of dead plants, animals, trees and other carbon-rich organic matter, and in places it reaches 1.5km (one mile) deep. While it stays frozen, that carbon is locked up in the ground. But as the Arctic warms and the permafrost thaws, microbes start to break down that organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9_Qn8UrxuE?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaming lakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - probably causing, tonne for tonne, around 25 times more global warming over a hundred years than carbon dioxide.  By lighting escaping methane, scientists can capture dramatic images of plumes of flame bubbling up through holes cut into Siberian lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are adding more and more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which is accelerating climate change. Permafrost contains massive amounts of carbon - probably about twice what's currently in the atmosphere, and about 5 times more than all the human-caused greenhouse gases we've released. While we don't have a really clear understanding of how much carbon might be released as the permafrost melts, it's fair to say that any extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from melting permafrost are bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/copy-of-nenet-girl-yamal-peni.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the melting permafrost, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. And so we need strong political action from world leaders at Copenhagen. We need to control the warming that's leading the Arctic to melt away. It's probably too late to stop climate change ending the Nenet's traditional way of life for good. But if we don't act now, that's going to be the case for pretty much everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Voila! Stop tar sands en Français</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tar-sands-france091009/</url><text>
	Our tar sands campaign just spread from Canada to France when 30 Greenpeace activists entered Total’s refinery site, in Normandy, to highlight the involvement of the French oil company with the climate-changing tar sands in Alberta. Activists unfurled one banner on a huge tank, and two others on the 75 meter-high chimney stacks of the site's power station. The banners read "climate crime" and "Total invests in sustainable destruction."
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            Total: "Our energy is your mess"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a global problem -- and this action is part of a global response to one of the worst climate offenders.  The world doesn't want Canada's dirty oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian "tourist" was also there participating in this action. Greenpeace activist Eryn Wheatley from Toronto was inside the Total refinery and occupying a large tank. She wanted to take a strong message across the Atlantic to Sarkozy and Europe -- that not all Canadian's support dirty oil, and real climate leaders shouldn't buy or fund tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not Canada's dirty secret anymore," said Eryn, from inside the Total site. "We're here today to expose an international climate crime. Sarkozy and other European leaders can't keep exporting the climate crisis to Canada. We need real leadership at Copenhagen and that means no more tar sands."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Totally criminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total S.A. has already invested more than 8 billion Euros in Alberta, and is planning to invest 10 billion more in the next decade, in Alberta and Madagascar, in order to step up its oil production from tar sands to 10 per cent of its global production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning's action follows &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; three weeks of intense actions in Alberta. Activists from France, Brazil, Germany and Australia descended on Canada's tar sands to draw attention to what they are calling a "global climate crime."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STOP tars sands, GO to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If production increases as planned, annual tar sands emissions are expected to quadruple to 126 million tonnes by 2015. In order to avoid runaway climate change we need to be drastically reducing these kinds of emissions - not increasing them. The best chance we have is coming up at the end of this year when the UN Climate Summit will be held in Copenhagen. World leaders must attend this meeting and agree to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will drastically reduce our emissions and prohibit projects like the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;

	We are thrilled to announce that one of our staff members, René Ngongo, has today been named a recipient of the 2009 Right Livelihood award.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rene Ngongo in Brussels 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo has been working closely with Greenpeace to save the Congo Basin Forests (the second largest tropical forest after the Amazon) since 2004, first in his capacity as head of OCEAN and now as Political Advisor for Greenpeace Africa when he led the opening of our first office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life story is an inspiring one. He grew up in Congo, near the Virunga National Park - a truly unique area with outstanding biodiversity which is included on &lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63"&gt;UNESCO's list of World Heritage in Danger&lt;/a&gt;. It was in these forests that he started to dream about becoming a Conservationist. He studied biology in the Kinsagani University where he also worked for several years. René also founded the highly-regarded Congolese NGO "OCEAN" (Organisationconcertée des écologistes et amis de la nature), which often served asa mediator between forest communities and key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the Congo Forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his work to protect the Congo Basin Forest from industrial loggers, René actively developed grassroots solutions and local contacts in remote villages. This infrastructure soon became the basis for educational activities on deforestation/reforestation and general environmental awareness building. Between 1994 and 2002, René developed tools to fight "slash and burn" agriculture. Among these tools were demonstration fields in Kisangani that showed local people possible alternative agricultural techniques. These allowed to diminish the pressure on the forests and provide better income alternatives to local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René coordinated the creation of a seedling plantation (20,000 seedlings) of the most exploited tree species in the Eastern province. This plantation provided trees for several 'green city' events. During these 'green city' (Ville Verte) events, trees were planted in abandoned parks, along avenues and in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of staying when you can leave is one of the most powerful things a person can do. During the brutal war that tore through Congo between 1996 and 2002, René didn't stop his efforts. He was one of luckier people who could have simply left the country, because of his network of friends outside Congo. Instead, he chose to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He monitored the use of natural resources by the different waring groups. During one of his 'green city' tree planting events on the outskirts of Kisangani, the war between Ugandan and Rwandan troops started. René and his invited guests had to search for cover from the artillery battle that suddenly started in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting against destructive logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that the DRC has returned to "relative" peace, more than ever, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/africa/problem/"&gt; the country's intact forests are threatened by large scale industrial projects such as logging&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a World Bank sponsored "reform" and a moratorium on new logging concessions that has been launched 7 years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMLYNmRc_I"&gt;companies continue to exploit the forest with impunity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly - if at all - paid and unequipped local control agents are unable to protect the massive old trees that are being logged and shipped to Europe and other international markets. But people like René continue the struggle against ecological destruction and social injustice. In his own words "Our forests are our livelihoods. They cannot be reduced to a cheap export commodity. For millions of people, the forests are their supermarket, their pharmacy, and the foundation of spiritual and physical health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Forests are also vital for our global climate&lt;/a&gt;. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from deforestation. In January 2009, the government concluded a legal review of 156 logging titles, and deemed 91 of them illegal. Despite this, some of the companies who have been not been validated continue logging today. Rene insists: "We have alternatives. We don't need to sell our forests for meager short term profits. We know today that our forests are worth more standing then logged, this is why we need a strong agreement and support for a global financial mechanism to reduce emissions and to end deforestation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Nobel Prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/"&gt;Right Livelihood Award&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the alternative Nobel Prize. It honours those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today. Several winners are announced every year and receive the prize in early December. We are beyond happy that Rene is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René's entire work is recgonised by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation today: "Since 1994,including through the civil war from 1996-2002, René Ngongo has engaged, at great personalrisk, in popular campaigning, political advocacy and practical initiatives to confront thedestroyers of the rainforest and help create the political conditions that could halt itsdestruction and bring about its conservation and sustainable use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the award, Greenpeace International Executive Director Gerd Leipold said: "While we hope President Obama turns his Nobel Peace Prize into real action for climate protection at this December's United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, it is people like Rene Ngongo who have already started the heavy lifting. People like René are the real climate leaders and it is good to know that at the very least one climate hero will be honored in Scandinavia this December."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Be part of Rene's life work: ask for protection of the forests for the sake of the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bravo Apple: company slams lobby group over climate change</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/apple-leaves-us-chamber-071009/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Latest high profile departure highlights split in Corporate America&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Apple has stormed out of the biggest lobby group in the United States. At issue is the US Chamber of Commerce's use of funds to oppose climate change legislation. Apple has done the right thing, and IBM and Microsoft should think different too.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/greener-Apple.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/greener-Apple.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Apple makes a stand for climate. Who will join them?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a murmuring of discontent within the Chamber over its lobbying against &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-critical-of-draft-s"&gt; US climate legislation&lt;/a&gt;. It has rapidly gathered pace over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson publicly stated their opposition to the Chamber's stance earlier this year. The energy company PG&amp;amp;E left, closely followed by Excelon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple took the most radical step so far, announcing on Monday it was leaving immediately because it did not support the Chamber's position on Climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who will be next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies with high-profile climate positions must be shifting a little uneasily in the boardroom right now. Staying silent on this issue is definitely not showing the leadership Apple and others have shown by speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coolit"&gt;Cool IT Challenge&lt;/a&gt; specifically calls on the IT industry leaders to show real climate leadership. &lt;a href="~/link/0f310e3ab69544948af86fa86ecccf59.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="~/link/097a1c87e2c04f7ea4812ee7cb3cb7e1.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; IBM&lt;/a&gt; sit on the &lt;a href="http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/all.htm"&gt;Chamber board&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, both have a financial interest in tough laws on emissions: they sell technologies and software which would be needed to cut emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for IBM and Microsoft to speak out against the position of the Chamber -- or do what Apple did, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisive moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might ask why is this a big deal? Many members of the Chamber have at least in words expressed support for legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they pay dues to the Chamber that uses this money to lobby for exactly the opposite. It's not a small amount either -- the Chamber spent US$488 million between 1998 to 2007 on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly object to the Chamber's recent comments opposing the EPA's effort to limit greenhouse gases... Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and it is frustrating to find the Chamber at odds with us in this effort... we have decided to end our membership &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of money buys a lot of influence in Washington's corridors of power. The Chamber hasn't been shy about its position either. In August it stated it wanted to put the science of climate change on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chamber &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/scienceandsociety/2009/10/green-apple-firm-is-latest-to-leave-us-chamber-of-commerce.html"&gt; questioned Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;' personal judgement in deciding to leave. Rather than lecturing Steve on innovation, the Chamber should be focussing the innovation needed to reduce emissions and the jobs this will create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the growing public spat between Apple and the Chamber we are definitely cheering for Steve. But he could do with some more heavyweight support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which other IT executives are going to match Apple's bold move? The stakes have never been higher for the climate. Apple's move will throw an uncomfortable spotlight on any company that stays on in the Chamber but doesn't act to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science says we need deep cuts in emissions and that means significant reductions in US emissions and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/copenhagen-greenpeace-demands/"&gt; a strong global deal in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December. The most progressive businesses know emissions cuts are inevitable and are gearing up to help lead the global economy to a prosperous, low-carbon future. The Chamber's current position represents the voices of the past that got us into the climate crisis. It is time the biggest US companies stepped up to consign this position to  the dustbin of history, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/10/climate_trashing_chamber_lashe.html"&gt; More on this story on our blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/4a75882fea2c4e36941400692ea057b0.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Sign our petition to Google, IBM and Microsoft to call out the US Chamber of Commerce for its opposition to climate change legislation, or follow Apple's lead and quit the lobby group altogether.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;The bottom line is: we can't stop runaway climate change without you. Whatever you can give today will help us ensure there's a decent planet left for us all tomorrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Global cattle giants unite to ban Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/global-cattle-giants-unite051009/</url><text>
	Today we have good news from the Amazon. Four of the biggest players in the global cattle industry have joined forces to reduce their carbon hoofprint and back our call for zero deforestation. JBS-Friboi, Bertin, Minerva and Marfrig are going to stop buying cattle from newly deforested areas of the rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Brazil's cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country’s leading carbon polluter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a direct result of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;', which we published less than 4 months ago. Since then, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies, including Adidas, Nike and Timberland worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan and committed to cancel contracts unless their products were guaranteed to be free from Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's announcement was made at an event in Sao Paulo, where each of the companies adopted new environmental and social standards to clean up their act and to ensure their products do not come from cattle raised in newly deforested areas of the rainforest. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Supermarkets (ABRAS), which includes Walmart and Carrefour, was at the announcement and supports the call for zero deforestation. Governor Blairo Maggi of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon and the largest cattle herd in Brazil was also there. Maggi announced that the state would support efforts to protect the Amazon and would provide high-resolution satellite images for monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making it work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures include the monitoring of supply chains and clear targets for the registration of farms that both directly and indirectly supply cattle as well as measures to end the purchase of cattle from indigenous and protected areas and from farms using slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country's leading carbon polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the United Nations General Assembly in September, President Lula announced a target of 80 percent reduction in deforestation by 2020 for Brazil. Deforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world's trains, planes and cars put together. A good climate deal will only be effective if it successfully tackles emissions from both fossil fuels and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 62 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil is ready and committed to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders to attend this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and there agree to an effective deal to avert the impending climate crisis. To keep global temperatures at safe levels, the deal must include the funds needed to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US $140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, so that developing countries can prevent and adapt to climate change. Approximately US $40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2015 in Brazil and Indonesia and by 2020 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama shows up in Copenhagen two months early</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-shows-up-in-copenhagen021009/</url><text>
	Our jaws hit the deck and we all fell out of our inflatables when we got word that Presidents Obama, Lula, Zapatero and Prime Minister Hatoyama were going to show up in Copenhagen. And then we found out that instead of showing up in Copenhagen for the UN Climate Summit in December, world leaders were actually going to be there today, 2 months ahead of schedule, to lobby the Olympic Congress for their cities to host the 2016 Games.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Acitivists make sure President Obama knows that his presence is required again in December at the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure the world leaders knew that their presence is required again in December, activists hung a huge reminder from the St Nicholas Church Tower reading "Obama: Right city, wrong date". The tower overlooks the church square where President Obama will be meeting with the Danish Prime Minister and Royal Family later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Olympic spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play is exactly what is missing from the current climate negotiations. Obama needs to help set a new pace in the climate negotiations, leading from the front instead of coasting at the back," said Jon Burgwald, Greenpeace Nordic climate campaigner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going for gold in December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to go for gold in December, and the big question is will Obama be a team player? Now that Obama, Lula and Zapatero all know where Copenhagen is they should have no problem making their way back in December, to lead the talks to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that averts a climate catastrophe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of state have to show up to the climate summit in December if we want a fair and binding climate deal. The promises that are on the table need to improve significantly, and that can not be done by delegations or environmental ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country in the world takes part in the Olympics, every country aims to win. No country will be free from unchecked climate change. Unless world leaders agree to avert climate chaos, we are looking at mass starvation, mass migration and mass extinction. Without the required leadership we will all be losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; - 26 activists have been arrested placing other banners around Copenhagen reminding the world leaders they need to come back to Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;The UN Summit in Copenhagen is less than 9 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate and show up to Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We will continue to fight to get world leaders to take responsibility and show up at the UN Summit in Copenhagen. We don't accept money from governments or corporations so we rely on support from individuals like you. Please give what you can so we can continue to fight for a fair deal at the UN Climate Summit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>World leaders block Arctic coal shipment </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/</url><text>
	Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and other world leaders took non-violent direct action today against a coal mine in Svalbard, denouncing the fossil fuel that is powering the meltdown of the Arctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders know they need to quit coal to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now THAT's the kind of headline we want to see in newspapers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Obama, Merkel and their friends are not really in Svalbard. Activists, wearing face masks, are doing what world leaders should be doing: stopping coal, the single biggest man-made cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of world leaders, it was left to our activists once again to take action. We started blocking the conveyer belt of the Svea mine, which was bringing coal to the  transport ship &lt;em&gt;MV Pascha&lt;/em&gt;, early this morning. Activists stopped operations by occupying a loading crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 10AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists are being removed from the coal loading site by police now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked operations throughout the night in minus 15 temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're sending a message from one of the places most affected by climate change: a message of urgency to the real world leaders.Banners reading "Coal Climate Crime" and "Coal Powered Arctic Meltdown" are now hanging from the coal crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svea mine is located at 77 degrees North and is one of the closest mines to the North Pole. Coal is exported from here to Europe where it is used to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature outside is below freezing and polar bears are roaming around but our activists are determined to stay on the conveyer belt as long as they can - to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/22_activists_are_now_blocking.html"&gt;Check out the live feed of updates from Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal fired Arctic meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise has been in the Arctic since June, hosting top scientists to document the effects of climate change in the region. They have found that Greenland's glaciers are losing ice at an accelerated rate. In September, the Arctic sea ice reached the third lowest minimum extent on record. The Arctic is melting down faster than scientists have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea-level rise could impact the homes of one in ten people on the planet this century. This coal-fired madness must stop. Our Energy [R]evolution report presents a realistic scenario showing how we can phase out coal fired power plants by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: take action (for real this time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just 66 days, the countries of the world will come together to negotiate a new climate treaty. World leaders need to take real action by personally committing to attend the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and to delivering a fair, ambitious and binding deal to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/call4copenhagen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;We need real leaders at the UN climate summit this December in Copenhagen. Join the global call for them to personally attend the meeting and ensure a fair, ambitious and binding treaty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Sending a ship to the Arctic isn't cheap. We've only been able to do it with support from people like you. Take the opportunity to make a difference for tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Green points for Hewlett Packard and Apple</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hp-gets-the-message-30-10-09/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;HP's penalty point lifted in latest Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Apple and Hewlett Packard get green points this month, as HP is rewarded in the latest edition of our Guide to Greener Electronics and Apple releases details of their greenhouse gas emissions. But the big points go to activist consumers for proving once again that public pressure creates positive change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When the gadgets we use go to Delhi for recycling, their toxic contents end up in acrid smoke.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; ranks the 18 top manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones, TVs and games consoles according to their policies and practice on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is published quarterly. We went to press before &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment" target="_blank"&gt;Apple's updated environmental information&lt;/a&gt; was published last week, but the welcome news of their transparency about greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental disclosures will be factored in to the next edition. Apple can justly pat itself on the back for listening to their customers who asked for greener gadgets. And all you Apple users should pat yourselves on the back for asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard had their penalty point lifted by putting a personal computer on the market that is virtually free of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/"&gt; PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, or vinyl plastic) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs)&lt;/a&gt;. Only the power supply unit and cable still contain these hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP back on track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP made a commitment in 2007 to have all PC products toxic-free in 2009, but went soft on that commitment earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we painted a protest on Hewlett-Packard's roof saying that HP stoodfor "Hazardous Products," and organized a phone-in protest with thevoice talents of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/breaking-green-promises" target="_blank"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;.With the new &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090915xa.html" target="_blank"&gt;HP ProBook 5310m notebook&lt;/a&gt;, HP has made the first step incatching up with Apple, which eliminated these materials from itsentire product line almost a year ago, and now puts pressure squarelyon HP's competitors to put more products on the market that are cleanerand safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; are still ahead on toxics removal, having eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, partly as a result of our "Green my Apple" campaign which brought consumer pressure to bear from people who loved their Macs, but really wished they came in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow learners: Dell and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and Lenovo each retain a penalty point for delaying their phase-out commitments indefinitely. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/acer-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will still achieve its target for eliminating PVC and BFRs in all products by the end of this year. Meanwhile Toshiba has a timeline to phase out these toxic substances from all its products by the end of March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top of the class: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Philips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; remains at the top of the ranking, with a score of 7.5 out of 10, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; with 6.9, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; with 6.5 and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; -- which leaps from 7th to 4th place -- with 5.9 points. The other climber is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sony-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt;, rising from 12th to 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow-footed: LGE, Fujitsu and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt; plummets from 4th to 11th position, weighed down by a penalty point for flip-flopping on its promise to get off the toxic sauce by the end of 2010 - now, only its mobile phones will be free of these PVC and BFRs by then, while phase-out in TVs and monitors has been delayed until 2012. At the bottom of the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fujitsu-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, with a score of 2.7, overtakes &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from 16th to second-last place with a score of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world needs climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition of the guide -- which also ranks companies on climate and energy criteria -- is released just two months before crucial climate change talks take place in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these powerful tech companies to stand by their claims and set examples of strong leadership for other industries to follow. It's encouraging that Philips, Acer and Samsung support the levels of greenhouse emissions cuts required to stem dangerous climate change. However industry giants like Apple, Nokia and Microsoft are failing to show climate leadership by making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take a quick survey&lt;/h3&gt;

	Yes, it’s true, we do indeed have scientists.  And some days, we even let them out of the lab. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Dr Paul Johnson
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days.  Our Greenpeace Chief Scientist, Dr Paul Johnston, has travelled from our international laboratory at the University of Exeter, UK to Ottawa, Canada to further our campaign to create a global network of marine reserves to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has worked with scientists ever since the organisation's founding days in the early seventies.  Recently, some of the world's best scientists have sailed on the Arctic Sunrise to monitor the growing threat to the Arctic region from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnston is attending the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Ottawa to stand up and defend the oceans. Greenpeace wants to see 40 percent of the world's oceans fully protected through a global network of marine reserves. We are aiming high with our 40 percent goal, as the &lt;a href="http://www.wdpa-marine.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;World Database on Marine Protection&lt;/a&gt; reports that currently, less than 1 percent is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1 percent, the majority of marine and coastal protected areas are situated within country Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), leaving the high seas devoid of protection. Even more startling, is the fact that only 12.8 percent of protected areas can be considered as true marine reserves, meaning closed to all extractive activities including fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the CBD put ink on paper, pledging to establish a global network of marine reserves by 2012. Five years later however, the pledge is still struggling to make it off the page and into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years we've been trying to help governments designate areas for protection -mapping it all out for them in the Roadmap to Recovery, launched at the CBD in Brazil in 2006.  Last year, the CBD adopted criteria to identify areas for protection, which were very similar to our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with two case studies on how marine reserves could work in the Pacific and Mediterranean, Dr Johnston will be giving advice on how to implement the criteria to identify areas for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships have been in action in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/bluefin_tuna_action_in_turkey.html"&gt; Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/voices_of_pacific_activists_te.html"&gt; Pacific&lt;/a&gt; this year - highlighting the need for protection, especially confronting overfishing of tuna stocks which are decreasing at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Dr Johnston will show in Ottawa, change can be made to protect our oceans. We have the solutions, we just need governments to hear us out and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently 160,761 supporters have helped us be heard and defend the oceans by signing our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt; Marine Reserves Petition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know what you buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species"&gt;If you're a fish consumer, check the red list before buying fish to make sure the fish has been sustainably fished. Tell your retailer if they don’t know where it came from, you don’t want it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists stop climate crime in the tar sands</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activists-stop-climate-crime-tar-sands/</url><text>
	What is soon to be bigger than England and account for more greenhouse gas emissions than the Czech Republic? The tar sands of northern Alberta, Canada - the largest energy project and the largest industrial project on the face of the planet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what unrestrained fossil fuel development and unchecked emissions looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning of September 15th 25 Greenpeace activists enteredthe Albian tar sands operation and proceeded to blockade themselves inthe cabs of two dumptrucks and one crane. They remained on the site for30 hours, successfully shutting down the entire operation and sending astrong message: the &lt;a title="tar sands" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tarsands"&gt;tar sands are a climate crime&lt;/a&gt; and they must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tar sands - sometimes referred to as oil sands - are one of thedirtiest sources of oil on the planet, and extracting thisunconventional oil resource has created a truly hellish landscape. Vastareas of wilderness are chewed up andreplaced by toxic lakes, open pit mines, refineries, andpipe lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting tar sands deposits is hugely energy intensive and produces emissions to the tune of &lt;strong&gt;100 million tonnes of carbon per day&lt;/strong&gt;. Worse, most deposits are located underneath boreal forestwhich must be completely destroyed to extract the tar sands whichfurther accelerates climate change. TheCanadian boreal forest is a huge carbon storehouse, and emissionsresulting from this deforestation have yet to be included in theofficial emissions. Not that the atmosphere cares about the officialnumbers. It is clear that tar sands development ispushing us towards catastrophic, runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate leaders don't buy tar sands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that world leaders still need to get the message. We will continue to expose the horror of the tar sands until they face the urgent facts and wean themselves off the brutal addiction to fossil fuels which threatens us all with catastrophic climate change," Mike Hudema, Climate Campaigner with &lt;a title="gp canada" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Canada&lt;/a&gt;, commented from the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the mining site, Greenpeace will continue to bear witness to the total devastation that is the tar sands. The message going into critical UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December is that climate leaders don't buy tar sands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockade coincided with the release of climate demands from the world's largest global investors - who issued a &lt;a title="statement" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for 'strong action this year from international policy makers in the fight against global warming.' Signed by 181 investors in total - this is the largest statement of its kind in history and shows that the future lies in a green, sustainable energy industry - not in the tar sands. It also makes clear the expectations investors have for world leaders this year. It was issued 80 days before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - which is the best chance the world has to agree to serious emissions cuts and strong climate policy that will avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's recently released 'Green Jobs' report shows that this green energy future is not only possible, but it is beneficial to jobs in the energy sector. It is the first ever jobs analysis of a clean energy scenario made on a global scale and is part of Greenpeace's &lt;a title="energy rev" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario. &lt;a title="working climate" href="/international/en/publications/reports/working-for-the-climate/"&gt;Working for the Climate&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that the shift to a renewable-energy based global system would be our best bet for environmental, energy and job security. By 2030 the report projects we could have &lt;strong&gt;8 million renewable and efficiency power sector workers&lt;/strong&gt;, while in contrast, if we continue with business as usual the energy sector would lose jobs - 500,000 of them by 2030. The choice is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A poster child for climate destruction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of the tar sands bring home exactly how devastating and destructive this energy project is for the environment. The toxic lakes created by water discharged from the extraction process are so vast they can be seen from space, and so toxic that cannons have to be regularly let off to scare away wildlife. This does not stop 11 million litres of leakage to occur per day. Even worse than what has already been done is the pace at which tar sands development is expected to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

The projections made are frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tar sands emissions are bigger than Estonia and Lithuania right now andin 2020 will be larger than countries like Belgium, Austria, Irelandand Denmark," explains Nikiforuk. These are daunting figures which make it all the more pressing that our world leaders take responsibility and act on climate change. They could learn a thing or two from the 25 activists that successfully shut down the Albian mine operations. One of the activists had this to say afterwards: "We look atour logo 'Stop the tar sands' which seemed so extreme a week ago - andnow it seems possible."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            SolarChill prototypes - the vaccine cooler and the refrigerator.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.solarchill.org/index.html"&gt;SolarChill&lt;/a&gt;
was born through separate discussions between Greenpeace,the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World
HealthOrganization. The big challenge: providing affordable
andenvironmentally safe refrigeration for the maintenance of
vaccines andmedicines, and the preservation of food, in parts of
the world thathave no electricity or have unreliable supplies of
electricity. At themoment refrigerators in developing countries
usually use kerosene,propane and to far lesser extent, solar power.
Vital medicine ismost often stored in unreliable kerosene
refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kerosene and vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerosene refrigerators consume about 1 litre of kerosene daily.
Notonly do they emit unpleasant fumes, theyoccasionally catch fire,
they need to be regularly fuelled up, andthey are often not
reliable for maintaining the required vaccinetemperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they are also environmentally harmful as the burning
ofkerosene contributes to global warming. There are approximately
100,000kerosene refrigerators in use today around the world for
coolingvaccines, which means they produce approximately between 73
and 91million kilograms of CO2 each year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What about solar power?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar Vaccine Coolers are already in use in parts of the world
thatlack electricity, and they have proven to be more reliable than
theirkerosene counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are only approximately 6,000 solar vaccine
coolersaround the world today. Two big problems: they rely on
batteries, whichare expensive and toxic to make and dispose of, and
they cost more than kerosene coolers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a solar cooler today is in the US$3500 to US$4500
range. Incomparison, the cost of the SolarChill package, cooler and
solar panelscombined, is projected to come in around US$1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The birth of SolarChill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, at about the same time as we were talking with
UNEP andWHO, the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) began the
development ofa new solar refrigerator that bypassed the use of
batteries. We decidedto join forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided the funds for the development of the first
SolarChillprototypes. These were exhibited at the World Summit on
SustainableDevelopment in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so special about these refrigerators?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="179950" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarChill refrigerators don't need batteries or a connection to
theelectrical grid - they store power in three 60W voltaic panels.
They dohowever have an AC/DC converter, which provides flexibility
to usewind, hydropower, bio-gas or grid energy (and even a
carbattery!) when there is not enough sun. The coolers are also
energy efficient because theyhave excellent insulation. They don't
contribute to globalwarming thanks to the special hydrocarbon
system made by our friends atDTI and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even maintaining a constant temperature, important where
medicine isconcerned, doesn't need an electronic controller - it is
managedthrough natural convection methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single SolarChill unit can serve a population of 50,000 people
forpreserving vaccines, and will be 50 - 60 percent cheaper than
currentsolar refrigerator models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Can I buy one for my new kitchen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet ... a second generation of prototypes of the SolarChill
VaccineCooler went into field testing at the beginning of 2004 in
Senegal,Indonesia and Cuba. 10 prototypes of the chest freezer
vaccine coolerare being tested under a variety of climatic
conditions, including atthe DTI laboratory in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans call for similar field testing of the upright freezer
SolarChill Food Refrigerator in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the technology will be made freely available
tomanufacturers around the world, so we hope that after that
SolarChillwill be available in both developing countries and your
localdepartment store.&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you
couldstill see the occasional grand fig tree. Kids rushed up and
hugged us.I sensed that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the seeds for a safer life are already here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message to the Prime Minister&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;72% of the Turkish public wants Turkey to be nuclear-free.  Ask the Prime Minister to make it so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give peace a chance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us keep the Peace Embassy going and our activists around the world working for an end to the nuclear threat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/5/sampling-activists-blood-outsi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have visited two of the major producers of toxic chemicals at
theirplants in Belgium to pressure them to produce safer chemicals
andsupport the inclusion of obligatory 'substitution principle' (EU
speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The city of Ulsan, Korea has ordered us to vacate our "Whale Embassy" -- built near the site of a planned whale meat factory.  We've told them we'll be happy to leave, once they assure us they will not build the factory.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea ... with campaigner Jim Wickens on the phone as usual! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, we uncovered plans by the Korean government to
build awhale meat factory in Ulsan.  The discovery added togrowing
evidence that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea wants to reopen commercial whaling.&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We established our Whale Embassy to open a dialogue with local
peopleabout the government's plans, to explain just how many people
aroundthe world oppose whaling, to call for a cancellation of plans
to buildthe factory,  along with assurances that Korea will not bow
topressure from Japan to resume commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had visitors and volunteers from the local community, the
NewZealand Ambassador stopped by, and a great deal of local
pressattention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City officials embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But City officials are not at all happy with us tarnishing
theirreputation as the "City of whales" with our suggestion that
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ulsan isactually heading toward becoming the "City of whaling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Oureviction notice stated they want usto leave because they
claim we are in the way of the proposed Oceans Day ceremony on May
31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have given us until Monday, May 16th to get off the
site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stifling criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale campaigner Jim Wickens says: "It is quite clear that they
want tostifle any criticism of their plans to build the factory.
Today theyshowed us plans of the Oceans Day ceremony being planned,
and on theentire 15,000 square-metre site, they don't have any room
for ourlittle embassy.  We have told them that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;any attempts to evict usforcibly will reflect very badly on their international image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been several attempts at intimidation,
official andunofficial. According to Wickens: "Last night at four
in the morningfour local fishermen turned uplooking for trouble,
luckily there were others awake to come and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been tipped off that in Korea in &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;sensitive political protests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,thugs are often allowed to do the dirty work. There is a
possibilitythat this may take the form of fake fishermen coming to
beat us up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries has &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/"&gt;sent a
fax to ourheadquarters in Amsterdam claiming we are distorting the
truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Hygienic" butchering of "accidental" whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
They say that the whale meat factory will merely be a sanitary
measure-- a way to hygienically butcher the whales which are
"accidentally"killed by becoming entangled in nets, and those which
might be killedin a possible programme of "scientific whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="accidental whale kills" align="middle" height="235" width="400"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea allows the commercial sale of whale meat fromaccidental
kills.  The Ministry didn't respond to our observationthat &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea and Japan individually in 2003 caught more whales byaccident than all the fishing fleets in the world combined reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor did they comment on the stories that local people have told
usabout some methods fisherman use to "accidentally" catch
whales:ramming them with the ship to cause massive internal
injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="137081" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With our own eyes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We witnessed the butchering of a juvenile minke whale which
was"accidentally" caught.  The whale meat was packaged up for sale
ata value of US$30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At prices like that, you can well imagine why a city official
might want to build a whale butchering factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who can stop the whale meat factory is Ulsan mayor, Mr.
Park Maeng-woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local businessmen, such as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;deputy vice president of Hyundai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, havebeen vocal supporters of the whale meat factory,
apparently unaware ofthe brand damage which other multinational
corporations have sufferedwhen they've been exposed as having a
close association to whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea hosts the International Whaling Commission meeting this
year inJune. The meeting that could open the doors to a return to
commercialwhaling, which has been banned since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tell the mayor to stop the whale factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're trying to warn Mr. Park Maeng-woo just how passionate
peoplearound the world are about saving whales -- how much his
town'sreputation, the reputation of Hyundai corporation, and the
reputationof his country are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1770&amp;amp;s=gen2"&gt;You
can help us let the Ulsan mayor know&lt;/a&gt; just how important it is
toGreenpeace supporters worldwide that he make the right decision
andcancel the whale meat factory. &lt;/p&gt;

	On different continents in two very different communities, Paul and Ruby are battling Dow Chemical's refusal to take responsibility for its legacy of pollution, shady dealings and disregard for human life.  In Part 3 of our feature, we hear from Paul and Ruby as they strengthen their resolve to keep up the fight - wherever they are in the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Local families play beside the river unaware that  it is being polluted by effluent from Dow's plant up stream.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Ruby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The world is progressing at a new speed these days - but does anyone stop to think what sacrifices are made at the altar of this progress? We cannot even begin to estimate the many things that we have sacrificed in the name of progress; technology may have made our lives simpler, but the very same technology can be misused for destructive purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are focussed only on their profits, to the extent of being inhuman - and Union Carbide (now owned by Dow Chemical) is the prime example of these. In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my college in Bhopal, my friends and I spend most of our free time discussing the corporate crimes of Union Carbide in Bhopal. Most of my classmates are residents of other states, and knew very little about Bhopal before coming here. In fact, they only knew what the newspapers had told them about the Bhopal gas disaster. But I have related my story to them, and revealed the fact that the disaster was not an accident, but a premeditated acceptance of the 'risks' and a callous approach towards safety systems that 'cost too much' to be kept in operation. Once they have heard the full story, there is an almost unanimous understanding that none of us would ever want to work for a firm like this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="257" height="55" align="left"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates and I recently attended a seminar on health problems of survivors. My classmates were very moved by this seminar, and offered to help out with putting up posters, inviting people to the subsequent programmes and generally spreading the word. In fact, they all told me that they were keen to help our campaign for justice in Bhopal whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, we were all sitting around and talking about our experience with this seminar, when someone came up with a brilliant suggestion - why not form a youth club to support the Bhopal campaign, and to oppose the work of irresponsible companies like Dow in other parts of the country! I knew this would prove to be a brilliant idea, because the power of youth joining our campaign would make a world of difference to the campaign. It will also ensure that the campaign gets another lease of life, with a new generation joining in to take it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read Paul's story, it seemed almost eerie - to think that he is going through almost the same kind of battle that our community is, and that too, because of the same company. His story and mine seem disturbingly similar. When I read his story, it seemed as if were both living in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's story also strengthened my resolve further - I am now convinced that the battle against Dow Chemicals needs to be fought on the global scale, and spread the word, involve more youngsters in the campaign, and fight them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely wish Paul and his community all the very best in their struggle. Maybe we can swap emails with ideas and tactics to help both our campaigns. While writing my own serial stories, and reading Paul's stories, I have realized the global nature of our campaign. I also feel like I have found a friend in Paul, learnt about his life, and presented our two different, yet similar stories to the millions of readers who log onto the Greenpeace website from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that in 20 years time, when we are both in our 40's we can reflect on the day Dow accepted its responsibilities and did the right thing in Bhopal and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Paul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since I found out Dow Chemical had quietly been polluting the area around my home for years I have been constantly amazed by this company. I have to give it credit for the amount of hard work and millions of dollars it spends in order to make the public believe it is a responsible company. Rather than tackle the pollution problems of its own making it does all it can to avoid this. Its story is the same be it here in the US or in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered Dow had polluted areas downstream of its [Michigan] plant with levels 9000 times the state clean up levels the Dow denial machine went into overdrive. First it denied it caused the pollution. Next it hired the best PR firms and lawyers and lobbied local politicians to ensure it didn't get the blame. Even so it was proved that Dow caused the pollution. Oops! So then it spends more money on PR, lawyers, and lobbying politicians to say dioxin is harmless. But test results prove levels are dangerously high. Dow now spends money on more PR, trying to spin the test results. It even tried but failed to get the state of Michigan to raise the clean up levels, in an attempt to instantly make the problem disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="297" height="119" align="right"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this denial, lobbying and muddying of these dirty waters costs Dow millions. Just imagine if it had owned up straight away and spent this cash on tackling the problem. That is what the affected communities and I are fighting for. We don't have millions of dollars or fancy lawyers but we have the most powerful weapon - the truth on our side. I am campaigning for a clean up of the river, and ideally medical monitoring of all contaminated individuals' health. Would it have been smart to admit to the dioxin contamination and clean up the problem at the outset, so saving Dow millions? Yes, for sure! I don't understand Dow's thinking, it must have some egotistical management that doesn't like to be proven wrong, maybe that is why they refuse to clean up the river. If only women ran Dow, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything Dow does is wrong and some people in the area have benefited from Dow's presence. But I firmly believe that Dow can make a profit without trashing the environment and harming peoples health. Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth and refuse to except law and moral responsibility for their business actions. Couldn't Dow just take one years profits and instead of giving it to lawyers, PR firms, politicians or shareholders, resolve the problems of its own making? That is all I ask and many others the world over would like to know. Is that a lot to ask for? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposing side will probably say, people like me don't understand business and just want to harm Dow. But it seems Dow can do this itself with poor judgments involving the use of its money. I am not trying to destroy businesses; I just feel a business should have some moral values, at least one moral value. A business shouldn't destroy the lives of others in order to make a few extra bucks. No person or company should do that. A company should respect its workers and their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby shouldn't have to wait 20 years or more for justice after the disaster in Bhopal. People in Michigan shouldn't have to fight against a company and the state in order to enforce state laws. People in government have obviously failed both the citizens of Bhopal and in Michigan, they bend over for Dow at any chance they get, thinking of only themselves. How many more people have to die in Bhopal in order for clean up and how many more silent and slow deaths caused by dioxin pollution do the citizens of Michigan have to face? Sadly enough for me and Ruby, it seems both of our countries value profits over precious life. One can make and create all the money he or she desires, but one can't recreate an aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, or mom and dad after they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Who are we? Young people who want to change the world! What do we want? Renewable Energy! Make no mistake - the world is heading for climate disaster if we don't change our dirty energy ways soon. The young people of the Solar Generation project don't want to be living in a disaster of our making. They are campaigning now for the switch to clean renewable energy across the globe.

        &lt;p&gt;
            15,000 postcards from the public calling for renewable energy are delivered in a ball of ice to the Bonn Renewables conference. While there was some progress at the conference it still left much to do to tackle global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people have the most to lose from global warming but also
the most to gain from the urgent action that is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts. Right now young people from around the
world are coming together under the Solar Generation banner to end
the inaction that brings global warming disasters closer and
closer. Henry is from China, where clean energy is a must for the
huge population. Abigail, from the Philippines, comes from a
community fighting a dirty coal power station on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now members of Solar Generation are facing possibly their
biggest challenge. Many of them are in Bonn, Germany for a major
political conference on renewable energy. Their challenge is to
bring the reality of global warming to politicians cosseted in
stuffy, plush conference rooms and help ensure the conference will
amount to more than just nice words about renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Abigail addressing renewables conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60915"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;They
made a start with the chance to make a speech to the first day of
the conference. Abigail addressed the delegates along with Henry
from China and Lisa from Germany:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With what we are experiencing, we, the members of Solar
Generation are putting our feet forward against climate change and
are pushing for renewable energy. Members from different countries
lobby to politicians, organize rallies and camps to increase public
awareness, participate in direct actions and support each other in
raising funds for renewable energy installations. We, the Solar
Generation, are doing what we can. Now is your duty to do what you
can!"(Read the &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/index.php/pages/DisplayPage?id=147"&gt;
full speech&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in China, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.hk/africa/News/Multimedia/photos/israeli-marine-forces-board-th/?campaign_id=32"&gt;
Henry&lt;/a&gt; has been busy with Solar Campus projects to spread the
word on renewable energy to students and lobbying Chinese energy
companies to invest in renewable power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that our actions and passion for our environment
could make waves in our world! We will spread our concerns on
climate change and take action to change the behaviour of power
companies, government and our universities, with the support and
spirit of more and more energetic youths!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if today's political masters rise to the
challenge of tomorrow's Solar Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Solar Generation in the following countries: &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.fr/solargeneration/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jugendsolarprojekt.ch/"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergynow.org/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Kids for Forests in action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kids-for-forests/</url><text>
	A lot of important politicians are currently doing a lot of talking about preserving the diversity of life on Earth at a global UN meeting. Unfortunately talking is just about the only thing they have been doing to preserve life on Earth for the last 12 years. Future generations will have to live with the consequences of current inaction. That is why kids from regions threatened with destructive logging are in Malaysia to speak truth to the bureaucrats.
&lt;div&gt;

            A teenager from Cameroon (foreground) and a girl from Canada (background) at the UN Summit for Life on Earth (Convention on Biological Diversity.) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the world's ancient forests are being logged towards
oblivion. The culprits are logging companies, often acting
illegally, which are turning thousand-year-old forests into quick
profits. The members of our Kids for Forests Delegation see this
destruction of our shared future in their own regions. They have
come to Malaysia, to the meeting of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), to convince politicians to turn words into
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the delegates Omanie Sakespeso, 18 came all the way from
Papua New Guinea to plead with delegates to help save his home from
international logging companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." title="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56764"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
forest is my life and logging companies are taking my life away.
The creeks that we used for medicine are contaminated and our
burial sites have been destroyed by heavy bulldozers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omanie pleaded with the delegates: "You must carry out your duty
and protect my last remaining tropical rainforest. It is my first
time out of my country and I came all this way to tell you that you
need to take action now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Forests - furniture or a future?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last CBD in The Hague, 2002, delegates heard politicians
promise to stop the destruction of species worldwide by 2010. In
that time Kids for Forests have continued their campaign to elevate
the level of awareness among their peers on the issues of forest
destruction and ocean degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." title="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56761"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Clara
Buer, 21 from Germany who gave a speech in The Hague two years ago
is not impressed with the lack of action taken by the international
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Two years ago in The Hague I stood before you. Two years ago
you promised to stop the loss of life on earth. But in two years
nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am deeply disappointed, but I am back. Because young people
never give up fighting for their future and because I still believe
this place is the right place to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forests project" title="Kids for Forests project" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56749"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Your
promise is worth nothing, if you allow the ancient forests to be
boiled to paper or turned into furniture. Your promise is worth
nothing, if there isn't an outcry among you, when huge fleets of
ships take everything out of the oceans unregulated, undocumented
and illegally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kids for Forests youth delegation consists of around 30
young people between 13 and 20 years of age, coming from 13
countries around the world: from Australia/Pacific, Austria,
Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia,
Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Two to three young people from
each country are invited, accompanied by one Greenpeace
chaperon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clara ended her speech with a promise of action: "We are doing
our part. Now, it's your responsibility to set the course for a
global network of protected areas. And let the people affected,
especially indigenous people like Omanie, take part in the
decisions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Worth Fighting for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forest Project" title="Kids for Forest Project" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56758"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Kids
for Forests and Greenpeace are fighting for protected areas at the
CBD in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Protected areas are the backbone of
conserving life on Earth. It is widely agreed that, if we want to
halt that loss of countless plants and animals that are threatened
with extinction, we need an effective system of protected areas in
every country and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBD commits each nation to establish such a system. But this
goal has not been met: the system of protected areas is not
comprehensive, it does not represent enough of nature's biological
diversity and it is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want the governments to adopt a strong programme of work on
protected areas with strict targets, specific timelines and clearly
identified responsibilities. We want them to tell us who (which
country, which political institution) is doing what, by when, and
how they plan to establish a global network of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the demands of future generations, of children who
don't see the words "biodiversity" on a piece of paper but the
lives of the orang-utans, forest deer, monkeys, gorillas, and birds
that share their world -- and whose homes are threatened in exact
proportion to the threat to our own future.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year the planet awes us with meteorological phenomena, like monsoons in Asia and hurricanes off the Americas. But however devastating these have been, there was at least some form of continuity and predictability in their seasonal appearances. Now it seems that predictability is a thing of the past, with cases of extreme weather on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Japan suffered from its third typhoon in three weeks. It is the fourth major storm to hit Japan since late August, and is reportedly the most powerful to hit Okinawa since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor harvests, caused by this summer's bad weather and flash floods, are having serious consequences for farmers in northern Europe. Entire fields have been left to rot due to the summer's heavy rainfall. Some countries have had their wettest summer months on record. In 2003, dry weather provided a bumper harvest, but the havoc caused by this year's torrential storms could also reach into 2005, thanks to seed and soil damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more scientists are indicating that climate change is to blame for these recent erratic weather patterns. The concentration of CO2 (the main greenhouse gas) in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34 percent above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="600" height="495" data="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="quality" value="high"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report examing the impacts of Europe's changing climate. The report suggests that between 1975 and 2001, the annual number of flood events increased and that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years will see Europe experiencing more frequent and economically costly storms, floods, droughts and other extreme weather. While there will be wetter conditions in northern Europe, the south will have drier weather, threatening agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heat waves, pose a lethal threat to the elderly and frail, as occurred in the summer of 2003. Melting European glaciers are also an issue with EEA report estimating that three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps are likely to disappear by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hotting up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 ºC per decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, serious flooding in 11 countries killed around 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least US$15 billion. In the summer 2003 heat wave, western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30 percent. Melting reduced the mass of Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. Who knows what the economic and social costs of summer 2004 will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hurricanes too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's hurricane season has dramatically shown the danger of a world with increasingly extreme weather. Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances and now Ivan have made landfall in the Caribbean and Florida. In March, a hurricane hit the Brazilian coast - the first ever recorded in the South Atlantic. These storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and killed scores of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming larger and more damaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of global warming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans started heating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by while hurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet - gather strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that the Earth is getting hotter-and fast. The real question is will we slow the meltdown by curbing our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Stay away from ExxonMobil/Esso!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;ExxonMobil/Esso is the most active company in trying to kill any action on climate change. Exxon has secured court injunctions in several countries to keep us away from Exxon property. We're actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso properties! To make sure we're all clear about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away&lt;/a&gt;. Tell them you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are two more things you can do now:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finland resumes its destruction of old-growth forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finland-forests/</url><text>
	Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland.  The vast majority of Finland's valuable old-growth is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus.  Metsähallitus' logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value - including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            September, 2003, logging in Sami area
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being involved in a 'dialogue' process with two environmental organisations (WWF and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too - friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there's a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland's three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on customers of Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will entering their supply chain, pending comprehensive agreement on additional protection for these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin to switch all virgin fibre in their supply chain to sources that have been independently certified, at least to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Food companies go GE-Free in China</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/food-companies-go-ge-free-in-c/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;GE rejection gathers pace in world's largest food market&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In China, the world's largest food market, 32 food companies, producing 53 brands have agreed not to sell genetically engineered (GE) food. Although non-GE policy is already standard in many countries worldwide, this is the first time food producers have publicly committed to such a policy in China.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/7/chinese-consumers-turn-their-b.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese consumers turn their backs on GE food. Greenpeace Food Safety Roadshow visit to Huaying green community in Guangzhou.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, consumers around the world do not want GE
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food companies in China are joining the ranks of a growing
number of non-GE companies worldwide. This is another blow to the
GE industry, which is already troubled by increasing market
rejection and is desperate to find new markets to dump its unwanted
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some well known brand names appear amongst the 32 food producers
promising not to use GE ingredients in products sold in China
including Lipton, Wrigley, Wyeth and Mead Johnson. These companies
have already been selling non-GE food in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sze Pang-cheung said "Transnational food
companies are learning the lesson. There is a heavy price to pay
for applying double standards to Chinese consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we revealed Nestle´s ruthless overseas practice of selling
GE food, including baby food, in China and other Asian countries,
the Swiss-based company´s "double standards" met with angry
reactions from Chinese consumers who returned products to
Nestle.&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=7624&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;&lt;br&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GE is unmistakably the growing trend in China. The majority
of consumers do not want GE foods, and the Chinese government is
taking consumer's rights to choose seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released China's first comprehensive survey of consumer
attitude to GE food in January this year. The survey showed that a
clear majority would choose GE-free food over GE food and many
would be willing to pay more for it. An overwhelming majority of 87
percent wanted GE food products to be labelled. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=111516&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, the Chinese government introduced compulsory
labelling of GE food. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/news/details?item_id=15856&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has stepped up measures to enforce the labelling
legislation by conducting a nationwide inspection. Agriculture
officials emphasised that producers selling unlabelled GE products
would be penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The choice for food producers is either to label their GE
products and face consumer rejection, or to risk violating the
regulation by covering up the true nature of their products," added
Sze. "Companies simply have to make the right decision for
consumers, the environment and their business interests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge more companies to follow suit to address consumers'
growing concerns about GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

rapid action to save the planet from the devastation effects of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 15-day journey, a people's caravan for change, will traverse
the vast Central Plains of Thailand, from Khao Yai National Park to
the outskirts of Bangkok. The city is the venue of a crucial UNFCCC
(United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change) meeting
ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands. Ask them to go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work.

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;

            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose
risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;Ask governments worldwide to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting GE Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments.

	A climate tipping point is looming closer every day in the Arctic. The more we find out about the Polar Regions, the more we realise that what we know about the impact of feedback effects has been underestimated. Recent discoveries highlight the need for action now, before it’s too late. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subtropical currents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of independent scientists on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is investigating whether warming subtropical ocean currents are causing Greenland glaciers to melt faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the melt from warming temperatures is a known phenomenon, the influence of currents is less understood, and new research conducted by Dr Fiamma Straneo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution is groundbreaking.  (Or, perhaps, "icebreaking"?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over the last decade we've seen dramatic changes in the Greenland ice sheet; in particular there's been a large loss of mass of ice from Greenland's outlet glaciers. One of the mechanisms we think may have triggered these changes is the inflow of warm subtropical water inside of Greenland's glacial fjords," Dr Straneo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A (frozen) river runs through it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These currents could be causing the dramatic melt of Greenlandic glaciers. Dr Gordon Hamilton, of the University of Maine, has been studying the speed of flow of the Greenland glaciers, and in particular Helheim glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are like frozen rivers, with ice slowly moving downstream at an average of 50 meters per year. Helheim glacier is moving at the speed of 25 meters per DAY. Located further North, the Kangerdlugssuaq glacier moves at an average of &lt;em&gt;38 meters per day&lt;/em&gt;. This is opening the way for the Greenland ice sheet to flow out, melt in the Atlantic Ocean, and contribute to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is probably the world's fastest moving glacier. It tripled its speed between 2004 and 2005, which tells us the glacier is moving mass out of the middle of Greenland's ice sheet, in the form of icebergs, at a rate three times faster than just a few years ago. This has important implications for both the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the rate of global sea level rise," said Dr Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating feedback effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other feedback effects in the Arctic are highlighted in a new &lt;a href="http://panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/news/?173241/Warming-Arctics-global-impacts-outstrip-predictions"&gt; WWF report&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that  their influence on the global climate also may have been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic multi-year sea ice is increasingly replaced by younger sea ice, making the ice-cap more vulnerable to melting in the summer. This allows the surface water to absorb more heat. The permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is heating up as well, releasing underground methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This methane then further contributes to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report also points out that the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2007 estimates on sea-level rise were too optimistic, and offers new estimates of up to 1.2 meters by the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the IPCC reported an &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter5.pdf"&gt; estimated sea-level rise of 20 to 50 cm&lt;/a&gt;. As worrying as these figures were, evidence now suggest things are worse than they'd thought. The effect that the melting Greenland ice-sheet could have on sea-level rise was not fully included in the IPCC reports, since these findings are too recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we go beyond the tipping point where global warming feeds itself, there will be no going back. The time for action is now. In 95 days, the Copenhagen climate Conference will start. World leaders have to show their commitment to the climate by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;attending and adopting strong emissions targets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell global leaders to go to Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The French nuclear industry seems to think it's fair to ship nuclear waste to Russia and then forget about it. They think that keeping the waste away from the French public will protect their glossy image. Not as long as Greenpeace is around.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists lock on to rails to stop nuclear waste.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night three teams of Greenpeace activists blocked a train transporting nuclear waste to Cherbourg, the heart of the French nuclear reprocessing industry. From Cherbourg it was due to be loaded onto the transport ship Kapitan Kuroptev, destination Russia. We've taken action to tell them that "Russia is not your dumping ground."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the railway, at two locations en route to the fuel reprocessing facility. A third team of Greenpeace activists placed a truck on the rails in the centre of Cherbourg, along with a banner saying "Russia is not a nuclear dumping ground". The train came to a halt just 50 meters short of our activists. For delaying the transport of the illegal nuclear waste they were taken into custody by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocked train was carrying 500 tonnes of depleted uranium, just a fraction of what has already been dumped in Russia. The French nuclear companies AREVA and EDF claim there is nothing wrong with these transports, that the material is not waste but a resource that will be processed in Russia, and returned to France as fuel. Unfortunately that's just not the case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog-s.greenpeace.fr/uploads/2010/01/nuke1.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="261"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, 33,000 tonnes of uranium have been exported to Russia (including 23,540 tonnes of depleted uranium), while only 3090 tonnes of uranium made the opposite trip. 30,000 tonnes of waste has been abandoned in Russia. This is in direct contradiction with both the French law and the European Union directive, which prohibits the export and import of hazardous wastes. If you read French there's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/france/presse/dossiers-documents/rapport-hctisn-france-russie.bin"&gt; a full report on this available here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this behavior sounds familiar, it should. AREVA is an expert in the business of running a dirty business and leaving the waste far away. Whether it's dumping uranium in Siberia or &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2009/11/areva_nuclear_scandal_greenpea.html"&gt; mining uranium in Niger&lt;/a&gt; they've made sure the problems of the nuclear industry are kept well away from France.&lt;/p&gt;

	This week we have created a granite shield against bottom trawling in a fragile and ecologically important marine area in Sweden. Our activists sailed into Swedish waters and have so far placed 140 granite rocks (each weighing between 0.5 and 3 tonnes) in the Lilla Middelgrund in the Kattegat. Our intention is to move to nearby Fladen and do the same thing there.

But despite the existence of these vulnerable habitats, bottom trawling, one of most destructive forms of fishing, is common throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real protection needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawlers drag a net across the sea bed, indiscriminately catching everything in its path. This decimates stocks of popular fish, such assole and plaice, and results in a large amount of unwanted bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or dying. It also destroys any living structures that have grown on the sea bed - often acting as a sanctuary for an abundance of other life forms. Without apermanent ban on fishing in this area - there is no hope for the preservation of a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, marine protection exists only on paper. But our seas cannot wait any longer, their survival is at stake and politicians need to take action and implement laws that will protect the life of the seas today and for the future. However, under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) countries do not have the powers to regulate or prohibit fisheries. EU fisheries law states that such decisions have to be taken at an EU-level. This Catch-22 situation needs to be addressed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/plattegrond-van-het-kattegat-t.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, we placed 320 boulders in Germany's Sylt Outer Reef, another "protected" site, which was being destroyed by bottom trawling. In doing so, trawlers have been prevented from fishing on the reef and the boulders have already being colonised by a wealth of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long-term solution, we are calling on the Swedish EU-presidency to reform the CFP, enabling responsible authorities in member states to take necessary conservation measures in all types of marine protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fisherman's friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides showing up with some large stones - our team in Sweden has planned and prepared this work for months. An important step was the preparation of an environmental impact assessment to ensure that the activity would not be damaging to the environment. &lt;a href="http://eiastones.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;We also invited anyone interested - fishermen, politicians and all - to comment on our plans&lt;/a&gt;. The scientific impact assessment concluded that the strategic placement of stones would not negatively impact the marine environment, and the responsible authority shared this view and informed us that we would not need a permit. Fishermen from nearby Varberg also recognised theimportance of our proposal. As one fisherman said: "We shall and we must protect the shallow banks and the refuges that exist there. Then perhaps we can even get the wolf fish back."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to defend our oceans from the effects of over-fishing around the world, we are campaigning for a global networkof large fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of our oceans, including the North and Baltic seas. Supported by scientists - these reserves will restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse. Marine reserves also make our oceans more resilient to the ravages of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call now for a global network of marine reserves - protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mama Sarah Obama flicks on the lights  after a Solar power system was installed at her home in Kogelo Village, Kenya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a title="Solargen" href="/international/en/news/features/the-solar-generation/"&gt;Solar Generation&lt;/a&gt; Activists and local youth organisers installed the panels on "Mama Sara's" home, and also put panels on the Senator Barack Obama School in Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar installations are part of a 20 day renewable energy workshop hosted by Solar Generation with 25 participants from the Kibera Community Youth Programme and community members of Nyang'oma Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program helps young Kenyans learn how solar photovoltaic panels generate electricity, about their installation and maintenance and the fabrication of self-assembling solar lamps and their marketing potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what Mama Sarah had to say about the new solar panels on her house: "I am very pleased that my home has been improved thanks to solar energy and I'll make sure my grandson hears about it. Solar power is clean, reliable and affordable, unlike paraffin that is widely used in the area. Also, we now have qualified youth in the village who can help with the upkeep of the systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climate impacts reach Kenya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya, like many other countries in Africa, is on the climate impacts frontline. It has seen a drastic reduction in rainfall in recent years. Drought is amplifying problems in agriculture caused by poor land use and desertification, making Kenya's large scale hydro power unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, investing in solar energy technologies is a win-win strategy. It strengthens the economy and protects the environment, while ensuring a reliable and clean energy supply. The solar industry is ready and able to deliver the needed capacity. There is no technical impediment to doing this, just a political barrier to overcome as we rebuild the global energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes you can too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 108 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Tell President Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and take personal responsibility for their government’s response to climate change and to attend the United Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Leather industry giant moves to end Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bertin140809/</url><text>
	Bertin, the world’s largest leather exporter is joining the fight against deforestation and climate change and is finally doing the right thing and backing the call for a moratorium on buying cattle from farms responsible for Amazon deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is currently the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/" target="_blank"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon'&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies Adidas, &lt;a title="Nike victory" href="/international/en/news/features/nike-amazon230709/"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Timberland, Clarks, Geox and Timberland have all committed not to buy leather from Amazon destruction, prompting the recent decision by Bertin to commit to stop sourcing cattle from newly deforested areas and implement a traceability system to ensure the sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, Bertin will register and map all farms which directly supply cattle to the company. For the rest of the supply chain, including rearing and nursery farms, it will implement a traceability system from farms to its slaughterhouses and processing facilities by 2011. They will also ensure that they don't buy cattle from indigenous and protected areas or from farms linked to slave labour, land conflicts and land grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertin's commitment to end Amazon deforestation comes soon after a similar announcement from Marfrig, one of the world's largest beef traders. It leaves Brazilian JBS-Friboi, the world's largest producer and global exporter of processed beef as the last major exporter that has failed to commit to help end the destruction of the Amazon.  Contrary to its competitors, JBS-Friboi is staying silent on the issue and is actually expanding into the Amazon, having rented several new facilities north of Mato Grosso State, an area which has the greatest rate of cattle ranching expansion and deforestation in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's cattle sector needs to follow the soya industry's example and commit to a moratorium. Both the federal and state governments have to ensure a moratorium is effective by mapping, registering and monitoring rural properties and helping the private sector fulfill its corporate responsibilities. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction and contributes to making Brazil the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 114 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil has measures in place to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders, at this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, to agree on the funding required to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As activists continue a two day blockade of a coal export terminal in Queensland, Australia, the outcome of the Pacific Islands Forum in nearby Cairns has left Pacific Islanders to fend for themselves against the increasingly devastating effects of climate change - because it's clear their rich neighbours are unlikely to help them.

            Coal is the single biggest climate criminal
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal blocking activists from countries including New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Australia and the Cook Islands have been demanding that Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd (Australia) and John Key (New Zealand) stop putting the interests of big polluters over the future and the very survival of Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island leaders this week called for strong emissions reductiontargets of 45 percent by 2020 for developed countries and an ambitious global climate treaty aiming to limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5 °C. On Tuesday, the Small Island States leaders reiterated these demands at a press conference. But just two days later, not only have those demands vanished from the final communiqué, but the 2020 targets have also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of seeing an agreement on emissions cuts to fight climate change, the PacificIslands have received only promises to build higher sea walls against the rising tides caused by, amongst other things, Australian coal exports. This is yet another setback to the already shambolic negotiations process in the leadup to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter where this coal is burned, carbon pollution has no borders. Our homes are being devastated by climate change and we need genuine support from our Australian neighbours, not make-believe emissions cuts and empty &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;gestures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal or climate Kevin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftering our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/blog/energy/?p=728"&gt;activists spent 36 hours hanging off the Hay Point coal port&lt;/a&gt;, we sent our ship, Esperanza, to continue blocking the terminal. We have run three days of coal actions, including the complete shut down of the Abbot Point coal export terminal, to highlight the injustice of Australia and New Zealand abandoning their Pacific neighbours while throwing tax payer dollars at dying fossil fueled industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal exports to rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbot Point coal export terminal is set to double in size, financed by more than AUS$328 million (198 million euros) of public money in 2009/10. This will add an extra 67.5 million tonnes of carbon pollution a year - equal to the annual carbon footprint of 2.4 million Australians. And even though the Hay Point coal export terminal is already one of the biggest in the world, it is now being expanded from 112 to 190 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total capacity of Australia's coal exports will more than double from 332 to 730 millions tonnes per year. This expansion is a snub for the Pacific, and an economic and environmental disaster for Australia. By reinforcing Australia's position as the world's largest carbon dealer, Kevin Rudd continues to shun both his neighbours and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling short of weak targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear here: a global temperature rise of 2°C would still cause climate chaos in the Pacific. And if the world adopted the policies Kevin Rudd is implementing there is little chance of limiting temperature rise even to 2°C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24990/australia-coal-block3.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Key is expected to announce New Zealand's 2020 targets on Monday, but they are likely to also fall way short of the at least 40 percent by 2020 required - a target set by the climate scientists and &lt;a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/"&gt;demanded by nearly 90,000 New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that temperature rise must peak as far below two degrees as possible, and to get back to much safer levels after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see more than 12 coal ships waiting to load coal behind me. There are mountains of coal. It is a bit overwhelming - tonnes and tonnes of it. Everything I see here means to me that there's one more family that will be affected, one more child that won't have the future they &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;deserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They spoke to many Pacific people who are forced to deal with the changing environment on a daily basis. Now, in Australia - we're continuing to support the urgent Pacific call for world leaders to act now: to take personal responsibility for tackling climate change and guaranteeing a good deal for the climate in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;

	It is finally time to celebrate a major victory for the Boreal Forest! Kimberly-Clark has, as a result of public pressure, released a new environmental fibre policy that governs how it will help conserve forests and support sustainable forestry and use more recycled fibre.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Boreal forest is the largest intact forest ecosystem in North America. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;our campaign&lt;/a&gt; has been supported by tens of thousands of activists and hundreds of companies, to demand that Kimberly-Clark (K-C) stop destroying ancient forests like the Boreal Forest. In this tremendous victory for ancient forests,  the company that is known for its popular brands like Kleenex, Scott, and Cottonelle has announced &lt;a title="KC policy" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/KC"&gt;a policy&lt;/a&gt; that places it among the industry leaders in sustainability. This announcement brings the &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Kleercut campaign&lt;/a&gt; to a successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we can expect from the new policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark has set a goal of obtaining 100 percent of the wood fibre used in its products - including the flagship brand Kleenex - from environmentally responsible sources. By 2011, Kimberly-Clark will ensure that 40 percent of its North American fiber is either recycled or certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) - a 71 percent increase from 2007 levels, representing over 600,000 tonnes of fibre. Also by 2011, it will eliminate any fiber from the North American Boreal Forest that is not FSC®-certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of K-C's place in the paper products market, the company's new policy will send a strong signal to its competitors, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, SCA, and Georgia Pacific, that creating a policy that protects ancient forests is a key element of sustainable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;K-C's sustainability policy: Not just about protecting the Boreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Boreal Forest is North America's largest ancient forest and provides habitat to threatened species such as woodland caribou, bald and golden eagles, wolverine and more than one billion birds, many of them migratory. Sadly, more than 60 percent of the Boreal has already been allocated to forestry companies for development and less than 10 percent of the Boreal Forest is formally protected. Unfortunately, in provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, much of the commercial forest has already been fragmented and degraded by clearcuts and logging roads...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clear-cutting in forests doesn't just wipe out biodiversity - it wipes out an essential carbon storehouse. The Boreal Forest is the world's largest storehouse of terrestrial carbon. The Canadian Boreal stores an estimated 186 billion tonnes of carbon, or more than 27 years worth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting and managing the forest responsibly is essential for fighting climate change. Intact forests, particularly ones extending over thousands of square kilometres, better mitigate the impacts of climate change. The fight to protect the Boreal and forests globally is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need world leaders to agree on the funding required to end deforestation at this years Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations so please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Parody of Esso logo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our "Don't buy Esso, Don't buy Exxon/Mobil" campaign,
we developed a parody of Esso's logo with a double dollar sign:
E$$O. (Esso is the name under which Exxon/Mobil trades in many
parts of the world outside North America)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso took us to court for copyright infringement, claiming our
Stop Esso website would "confuse customers" into thinking they were
at a real Esso site. Hmmm. Esso customers must be a particularly
dim lot. Would you be confused by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that wasn't enough, Esso also made the feeble attempt to
claim that the logo made them look like Nazis, given a similarity
only they could see between two dollar signs together and the
stylized Nazi SS symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" title="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52918"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
the real belly laugh came when Esso claimed that our abuse of their
logo would damage their "good reputation." This is the company that
has done more than any other corporation to undermine the science
and policy debate on global warming. This is the company that
donated massively to George Bush's election campaign, and was
rewarded with the US withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol. This is
the company that despoiled the pristine Alaskan coastline with an
oil spill the effects of which are still with us today. This is the
company responsible for &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040128/energy_exxon_climate_1.html"&gt;5
percent of all greenhouse gasses&lt;/a&gt; on the planet. This is the
company which has been branded environmental criminal #1 and been
targeted by activists all over the world in a massive "Don't Buy
Esso" campaign. If Esso was really worried about its reputation, it
might try doing something for our planet and our children's future
instead of using its gargantuan legal resources to try and stamp
out the wildfire of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court ruled our parody of the Esso logo was within
acceptable limits of freedom of expression, rejecting Esso's claims
of tradmark infringement. Greenpeace has been campaigning against
the oil giant since 2001 when US President George Bush pulled the
US out of the international negotiations to tackle climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso has spent millions in its fight to stop the world's
government's tackling climate change, and was behind Bush pulling
out of the Kyoto Protocol. Esso obviously thought this case would
be an easy win but it was wrong. Today's ruling is a victory in the
fight to protect the climate against a company that will go to any
means to silence its critics," said Greenpeace campaigner, Anita
Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with us. Next time you pass an Esso or Exxon station,
put your thumb to your nose, wiggle your fingers, and say:
Naaa-naaa-naaa-naaa-naaaaa, Don't buy E$$O!&lt;/p&gt;

	Our marathon action in Chioggia, Italy came to an end last night after three days of protest when Italian police intervened to end our blockade of the Panama-registered bulk carrier, Keoyang Majesty, which is carrying 40,000 thousands tons of Argentine Genetically Engineered (GE) Soya.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the determination of 18 activists from our ship, the
Esperanza, this action has been going on since Sunday morning, when
they first boarded the Keoyang Majesty displaying banners saying
'Don't Buy GE Food' and 'Defend Yourself from GMOs'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night they left the GE ship for safety reasons, this
morning the focus changed to preventing the trans-shipment system,
used to offload the cargo from the ship onto small barges, actually
reaching the ship. Two activists boarded one of the barges, ten
activists climbed onto the elevator used to take the GE soya out of
the GE ship and six activists were in canoes between the barge and
the Keoyang Majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the blockade the Italian Ministry of Health has
committed itself to carry out an inspection of the GE Soya now
being unloaded from the Keoyang Majesty in order to check whether
the GE cargo complies with EU legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Pagnan, the company importing the GE soya meal, has
stated to our campaigners in Italy that it will provide us with the
list of the buyers for its cargo of soymeal. We will of course be
taking this issue up with these companies and put pressure on them
to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Keoyang Majesty from Argentina is transporting GE soya meal
for, among others, the multinational companies Bunge and Cargill,
to be used for animal feed. Italy imports 4.2 million tons of soya
annually for food and animal feed of which over 3 million tons are
estimated to be GE or GE contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto our GE campaigner from Argentina, who is on
board the Esperanza said: "Argentina is determined to produce GE
soya to feed pigs, cows and chickens in the developed world. Almost
its entire production of soya is GE. What remains of the native
forest lands are being converted for GE soya production, it is time
to stop this environmental and social nightmare in Argentina."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today informed the French government at a hearing that we will not remove information concerning nuclear waste transports from our websites.  This defies an order from the French Ministry of Industry to treat all information regarding nuclear materials in France and their transport as state secrets.  As a consequence, Greenpeace France and its staff may be facing jail and fines for informing the public about dangerous plutonium shipments.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists protesting nuclear power at Cattenom.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An order issued on August 9th in Paris declared all information
regarding the protection of nuclear materials, including
transports, classified for national security purposes. Greenpeace
is opposed to the production, transport and use of plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the transportation of plutonium, released in defiance
of the new decree, will be presented by Greenpeace at a "Special
Commission" that will hold a meeting on nuclear affairs today.
Politicians, Government officials and representatives of Cogema,
the state reprocessing company in Cherbourg, will attend this
meeting. The head of nuclear security within the French Government,
M. Lallemand, responsible for issuing the new security decree, is
also scheduled to testify at the Special Commission hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February this year Greenpeace blocked a nuclear transport
containing 150 kilogram of pure plutonium in the city center of
Chalon-sur-Saone, while en route from la Hague, Normandy to
Marcoule, in Provence. Cogema, the state nuclear reprocessing
company, conducts as many as 2-3 transports every week from its
reprocessing complex at la Hague to its plutonium fuel production
plant at Marcoule. Each transport carries enough plutonium for 30
nuclear weapons. In May, after Cogema resumed transports,
Greenpeace launched a 'citizens inspection' website containing
information on plutonium transports observed by volunteers and
activists along the 1000 kilometre route: &lt;a href="http://www.stop-plutonium.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stop-plutonium.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Putting us in jail to keep us quiet will not remove the
danger." said Yannick Rousselet. "Nuclear fuel shipments are
dangerous to the communities they move through, they are potential
terrorist targets, and they should be stopped rather than covered
up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the order flies in the face of nuclear industry
company Areva's policy of "maximum openness" regarding nuclear
transports. Under the new order, much of what Areva publishes on
their website and releases to the public would be classified
illegal. But according to an Areva spokesperson quoted in Le Monde,
the nuclear industry, which claims it was not consulted on the new
law, was told "we didn't need to change anything in our
communication policy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Opposing nuclear transports in France." title="Opposing nuclear transports in France." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47188"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
target of the order is Greenpeace, which has exposed the threat
from land and sea transports of nuclear fuel and waste in France
and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear materials travel a cumulative distance of 250,000
kilometres each year in France. One plutonium transport contains
sufficient material for 30 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. One cask
full of highly radioactive spent fuel elements contains
approximately as much radiation as was released by the Chernobyl
disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry claims that the casks are safe because they
have to undergo crash tests. In fact, they are tested to maintain
integrity when dropped 9 metres onto a hard rigid surface, or
dropped 1 metre onto a metal bar. They are tested to survive a 30
minute hydrocarbon fire at 800 °C. And they are cited as safe for
immersion to a depth of 15 metres of water for 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet according to French accident statistics for hazardous
materials, the casks would not withstand 1 accident in 20 involving
impact, and 50% of accidents involving fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transports could also be targets for terrorist attacks or theft:
Pierre Robert, a Frenchman jailed for life in Morroco for
terrorism, claimed to know of Al-Quaeda plans to attack a Cogema
plutonium transport. Greenpeace and WISE, in a report published in
February of this year, estimated that if such an attack were
carried out with heavy artillery near Lyon, it would impact 125,000
people, cause 500 fatal cancers and require the evacuation of part
of the city of Lyon and its outlying suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Stop Plutonium" title="Stop Plutonium" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47173"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Transports
are carried out without prior notification or consent of the
communities or countries along the transport routes. Last year
Greenpeace tracked and highlighted the dangers of a British
plutonium fuel transport from Japan to the UK. Over 80 Governments
condemned the transport based upon information provided by the
environmental organization along the 30,000 kilometre route through
the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French government's move to silence Greenpeace is consistent
with a larger move worldwide toward greater government secrecy in
the name of security. The nuclear industry in particular is taking
advantage of public fears of terrorist attack to become less
transparent and to silence dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, hundreds of thousands of public documents
were removed from government Web sites following the September 11th
attacks, including Environmental Protection Agency reports on the
consequences of industrial accidents. U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft's Justice Department told U.S. agencies to be more
cautious about releasing records and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If governments are serious about reducing the threat of nuclear
materials," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International "then the
only thing to do is end nuclear power. Increased secrecy
conveniently serves the nuclear industry's agenda of diminished
scrutiny. That means greater risks to an uninformed public, and
less public opposition. Plutonium and nuclear energy are not
compatible with democracy and have no place in our global
society."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Canadian harp seal hunt: largest ever</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/harp-seal-hunt/</url><text>
	The Canadian government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 350,000 animals this year. While "whitecoat" harp seals (under 2 weeks old) are still protected as a result of actions by Greenpeace and other organisations in the 70s and 80s, and some of the more extreme animal rights abuses have been outlawed, older seals can still be legally hunted under Canadian law.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace  activist sprays a seal with harmless dye to render its pelt worthless to commercial hunters in 1982.  An EU ban on killing harp seals under 2 weeks old put an end to the commercial hunt for whitecoats -- but not to the killing of older seals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's quota is the highest for any year since 1967.
Canada's cod fishery collapsed in the early 90s, and some in Canada
blamed the seals, despite the fact that the greatest culprit was
clearly decades of human overfishing. The collapse of fisheries
around Newfoundland due to mismanagement are a major driver in the
economics of expanding the seal hunt -- and part of an all too
predictable cycle of "exploit, deplete, and move on" which have
characterised human commercial hunts of wild animals the world
over. History has taught us that as soon as a market exists and
profits are to be made, the pressure to hunt a species beyond
sustainable population levels will inevitably lead to a
non-sustainable hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oppose any human activity harmful to populations of seals. We
oppose the killing of seals for commercial trade. We oppose taking
animals from endangered, threatened or seriously reduced
populations, from populations whose status is unknown or where it
is thought a hunt may have an adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add new uncertainties about how global warming is
impacting fragile arctic environments, an expanded hunt means the
impacts on seal populations are at best uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned
against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since
that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, and other organisations, have taken the lead in
campaigning against the slaughter of seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and other organisations taking action against the
commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Since the French power authority has refused to build wind farms, we built our own this morning on the grounds of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France. We put ten wind turbines up to protest the French government decision to build another nuclear reactor on the site, despite a large nuclear energy overcapacity and the far more environmentally and economically sane option of investing in wind energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/12/greenpeace-activists-display-1.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists display 10 model wind turbines on the premises of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France in protest at the French government's decision to build another reactor on the site.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franc for franc, wind is the better investment. As detailed in a
report published today, "Wind vs Nuclear 2003" the same money spent
on wind power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more
electricity than a nuclear reactor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of the proposed French reactor is officially estimated
at some 3-3.5 billion Euros. If this amount of money were invested
in wind power, some 7616 megawatts of wind capacity could be built,
compared to 1550 TWh in the nuclear case. Wind would generate a
massive 24 TWh per year, the equivalent of 6.5 million households.
Nuclear would only deliver 10 terrawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years wind power has gone from the hippy fringe to
economic viability. In Germany, over 3,200 megawatts of wind power
were installed in the last year alone, supplying electricity to
more than 2 million households. In the EU, a massive 75,000
megawatts of wind capacity is expected to be online by 2010,
tripling the current power and adding the equivalent electricity
production of 14 large nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this worries the nuclear industry, especially given
the current decline in nukes: no single reactor has been connected
to the grid in the last four years, and it would take at least
another 10 years before a new reactor could come online. A growing
number of old reactors have reached the end of their life
expectancies and should be shut down. In reality, wind has already
taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is urging state owned EdF, Electricity de France,
not to impose yet another dangerous and uneconomic nuclear reactor
on Europe. The EPR [European Pressurized Reactor] is nothing new,
it is an outdated and unsafe design, to be fuelled by plutonium and
will produce extremely radioactive waste," said our campaigner on
site, Jan Vande Putte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europe is at a crossroad and we refuse to let the nuclear lobby
dictate our energy future regardless of the opinion, the
environment and the security of people. Greenpeace asks EDF to make
the right choice."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-on-toxic-patrol-in/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace sailing vessel the Rainbow Warrior is currently anchored off the coast of Alang, India. Alang is the site of the world's largest shipbreaking yard. Greenpeace is planning to conduct "toxic patrols" of ships which are here waiting for scrapping. A team of experts will do a survey and take samples to determine what type of toxic materials are on board before the ships are beached and the actual scrapping starts. Shipbreaking is an enormous danger for people and the environment. Greenpeace is the only organization in the world fighting for the 100,000 people working in this industry and for the environment they live in.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 14th of October the highest court in India decided that
the responsibility for clean scrap (shipbreaking) lies not just
with the shipbreakers, but also, and more importantly, with the
ship owners. This Court Order says that all ships must be
toxic-free before the scrapping actually begins. If the Greenpeace
"toxic patrols" show that ships arriving in India for scraping
still contain toxic substances, we will demand that the Indian
government enforce the Supreme Court Order and take action against
the owners of these ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also lobbying the Indian government to take a
strong position in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
with the other shipbreaking countries (Bangladesh, China, Pakistan
and Turkey). The IMO is the only party, within the United Nations,
which can make international rules for the ship owners. At the
moment they have only proposed voluntary guidelines for the
shipbreaking industry. Greenpeace believes that only a mandatory
international law can effectively regulate the ship owners. At this
stage there are many ruses that ship owners can use to subvert
these the rules and regulations. If India is the only country that
has strict regulations on shipbreaking then ship owners will go
elsewhere to find lax regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Scrap yard Alang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alang shipbreaking yards started scrapping ships in 1983 and
is now the world's biggest. Alang contains 184 plots which employ
40.000 workers. Current shipbreaking methods pose a serious danger
to both people and the environment. Most of the toxic waste ends up
in the ocean. The workers inhale toxic substances, such as
asbestos, 24 hours a day: at work and, because they live right next
to the yards, at home. They are not provided with any protective
clothing or safety equipment nor are they provided with any
training on how to deal with toxic materials. There are regular
accidents in the yards which often cause the deaths of many people.
In the past three months there have been 4 explosions in which 25
people died. On top of all this most workers are paid on average
US$1 per day and have no system of worker's medical insurance or
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What Greenpeace wants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is not against shipbreaking or the shipbreakers.
Greenpeace wants a mandatory international law requiring that all
ships must have an inventory of all toxic materials on board.
Locations of materials must be clear. A plan must be made to remove
all these toxic materials before the ship goes for scrap and before
the ship gets scrapped it must be made fuel-free to avoid future
explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Spain is the only country in the European Union that tolerates the release of genetically engineered (GM) crops on a commercial scale. Though only cultivated on relatively small areas, the potential impact of Syngenta's GE maize on environment, agriculture and health and the total lack of information and precaution are of serious concern.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New report from Greenpeace slams the genetic experiment on maize in Spain
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GM maize (corn) contains a genetic construct called Bt 176,
consisting of a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis
that encodes an insecticidal toxin able to kill the European Corn
Borer. It also has a gene that confers increased tolerance to a
herbicide and a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic
ampicillin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngenta's (formerly Novartis) Bt176 corn was first grown in the
USA in 1996. The European Commission approved the placing on the
market of the GE crop in 1997, with a decision that was ignoring
the negative recommendations of the EU's own scientific committee
and the Environment Ministers Council. Several EU member states,
among them Austria, Luxembourg and Germany, prohibited the growing
of Bt176 maize due to concerns over detrimental environmental and
health effects. The Spanish authorities, however, approved the
commercial growing in 1998. While they are still on sale in Spain
today, the Bt176 varieties were already withdrawn in 2001 from the
list of approved varieties in the USA, a country known for its
support for GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52690"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
Spanish government not only ignored concerns over environmental and
human health risks, but also the fact that a majority of Spanish
consumers, as consumers in many other countries around the world,
say 'no' to GE foods and prefer non-GE products, even if the
genetically modified foods were much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report, "The impact of GM corn in Spain," has been
prepared by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. It reveals the
scandalous sloppiness around the planting of Syngenta's genetically
engineered maize in Spain. While the Spanish administration acted
irresponsibly in largely passing on responsibility for safety
standards to the GE company, Syngenta failed to meet even the lax
requirements that the government did impose. Five years after the
approval of the GE crop, the monitoring / prevention plan has still
not been made public. No official data is available on the exact
area planted with GE crops or on where they are planted; nor is
there an independent analysis of GE crop results in agronomic
terms, of the possible appearance of resistance in pest, of the
unwanted impacts on non-target species and soil ecosystem, or of
the effects of antibiotic resistance genes on animals and
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been proven that the GE varieties cultivated in Spain
give better results than conventional ones and are necessary and
useful for pest control. The low incidence of the corn-borer pest
in Spain does not justify taking the high risk of introducing Bt
maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52687"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
the meantime, the first cases of GE contamination have already
occurred in Spain. In 2001, organically grown maize in the Navarra
region was contaminated by Bt176 maize and, as a consequence,
farmers suffered losses since the crop couldn't be marketed as
organic produce. This illustrates how the 'polluter-pays' principle
is turned into a 'contaminated-farmer-pays' principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-author Juan-Felipe Carrasco of Greenpeace Spain said: "Spain
has become a big experimental field, where GE crops have been
cultivated for the last 5 years without any agronomic advantage
compared to conventional varieties and where no measures have been
adopted to prevent their negative impacts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish situation highlights the need for measures to
prevent the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;genetic contamination of conventional and organic crops and
should serve as a warning for the other European countries. No new
authorisation for growing of GM plants should be granted and, most
urgently, Member States should oppose the plans of the European
Commission to legalise the contamination of seeds by setting up
thresholds of authorised GE contamination in conventional seed
lots. Allowing contaminated seeds to be put on the market would
lead to a creeping and unmonitorable contamination of all European
farmlands by GMOs that would make it impossible to sustain a
GE-free supply after a few years. GE companies should instead be
made legally and financially liable for the environmental and
economic damages their products can cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing genetic contamination and other negative effects of
GE crops should now be the number one priority for the Spanish
Government instead of actively promoting GE agriculture in Spain.
We call on Spain to apply the precautionary principle and to stop
the growing of GE crops. The Spanish example should be a warning
signal to other European countries not to allow GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ship reaches the end of its life it needs to be disposed
of. For something which maybe several stories high, hundreds of
metres long and full of various hazardous chemicals and explosive
fuel/gases, this is not an easy job. Most shipping companies take
the profitable option of selling the ships to scrap yards in Asia
where ships are broken up on beaches by workers using their bare
hands or minimal equipment. Hence the shipping company makes some
easy money and dumps the pollution from the ship in the developing
countries of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some irresponsible shipping companies want to spread this toxic
trade to Africa. The beautiful Bolama beach in the west African
country of Guinea Bissau may soon be turned into a scrap yard for
old toxic ships, threatening nature and the lives of local people.
The beach is part of the Bijagos Archipelagos, classified as a
Biosphere Reserve by United Nations (UNESCO). In May we started an
online action to save the Bolama beach. It has already achieved an
initial result: after receiving thousands of messages from
concerned people from all over the world, UNESCO has sent a
research mission to assess the situation. But continued pressure is
necessary to make sure that UNESCO takes effective measures to
protect Bolama Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=766&amp;amp;s=ship"&gt;Send a message now&lt;/a&gt; to stop the nature reserve being turned into a scrap yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Shipbreaking web game" border="0" align="left" item_id="50797"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
companies behind this plan are some of the bad guys in the murky
world of the shipping industry. To shine a light on the dirty
business of selling ships for shipbreaking, we have developed a
unique new web game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you know &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/shipgame/"&gt;'the tricks
of the trade'&lt;/a&gt;. You are the owner of the old ship "Rubbish
Queen" and you have to get rid of it. Can you make as much profit
as possible? Or do you care for the people and the environment? Try
to do better than most current ship owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the number of ships for scrap increases. It is
estimated that by 2010, 3000 ships per year will be scrapped. To
pressure the industry to reform we have put 50 ships heading for
scrap under the spotlight. We asked the owners to commit to
cleaning the toxic material from the ships before selling them for
scrapping. Recently the first company from the list,
American/Norwegian ship owner Stolt Nielsen, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news45.asp"&gt;committed
to prevent future pollution and health threats&lt;/a&gt; associated with
the breaking of ships. The company has a history of dumping
contaminated ships on Indian beaches. This company can prove that
ships can be disposed of without harming the environment and
endangering workers in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has learned with great sadness of the passing of Mr Gary Gallon, who was a member of the organisation's first board of directors.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Gallon had a brilliant career as an environmentalist, with
the Society for the Promotion of Environmental Conservation (SPEC),
the Environmental Liaison Centre in Nairobi, at Pollution Probe,
and later with the Ontario government. He is probably most well
known lately for The Gallon Environment Letter, a widely
distributed environment and business e-newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gallon's formal involvement with Greenpeace was limited
to the early days in Vancouver, when he loaned us our first "real"
office space, his work and ours overlapped and complemented each
other at various points over the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, Gary Gallon received the Canadian Institute for
Business and Environment's Life Time Achievement Environment
Award.&lt;/p&gt;

	The French nuclear industry seems to think it's fair to ship nuclear waste to Russia and then forget about it. They think that keeping the waste away from the French public will protect their glossy image. Not as long as Greenpeace is around.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2010/1/venaejae-ei-ole-roskatynnyri-l.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2010/1/venaejae-ei-ole-roskatynnyri-l.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists lock on to rails to stop nuclear waste.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night three teams of Greenpeace activists blocked a train transporting nuclear waste to Cherbourg, the heart of the French nuclear reprocessing industry. From Cherbourg it was due to be loaded onto the transport ship Kapitan Kuroptev, destination Russia. We've taken action to tell them that "Russia is not your dumping ground."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the railway, at two locations en route to the fuel reprocessing facility. A third team of Greenpeace activists placed a truck on the rails in the centre of Cherbourg, along with a banner saying "Russia is not a nuclear dumping ground". The train came to a halt just 50 meters short of our activists. For delaying the transport of the illegal nuclear waste they were taken into custody by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocked train was carrying 500 tonnes of depleted uranium, just a fraction of what has already been dumped in Russia. The French nuclear companies AREVA and EDF claim there is nothing wrong with these transports, that the material is not waste but a resource that will be processed in Russia, and returned to France as fuel. Unfortunately that's just not the case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog-s.greenpeace.fr/uploads/2010/01/nuke1.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="261"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, 33,000 tonnes of uranium have been exported to Russia (including 23,540 tonnes of depleted uranium), while only 3090 tonnes of uranium made the opposite trip. 30,000 tonnes of waste has been abandoned in Russia. This is in direct contradiction with both the French law and the European Union directive, which prohibits the export and import of hazardous wastes. If you read French there's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/france/presse/dossiers-documents/rapport-hctisn-france-russie.bin"&gt; a full report on this available here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this behavior sounds familiar, it should. AREVA is an expert in the business of running a dirty business and leaving the waste far away. Whether it's dumping uranium in Siberia or &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2009/11/areva_nuclear_scandal_greenpea.html"&gt; mining uranium in Niger&lt;/a&gt; they've made sure the problems of the nuclear industry are kept well away from France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Blair nuclear announcement scuppered</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/blair-nuclear-announcement-scu/</url><text>
	Greenpeace climbers scuppered Tony Blair's nuclear announcement by delaying the UK Prime Minister's planned pro-nuclear speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/protestcbilondon.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/protestcbilondon.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The British Prime Minister gets a message from Greenpeace: no nukes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace climbers scaled the ceiling above the speaker'spodium holding banners saying 'nuclear - wrong answer' and thendropping down 'radioactive' confetti, preventing Blair from speaking inthe main gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech has been widely promoted by Blair'sspin doctors as being a vehicle for announcing a further energy review- and for Blair to indicate his personal support for more nuclear powerstations being built across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Tindale Director ofGreenpeace UK said, "Today Blair is trying to launch a new nuclear ageand we are here to stop him. Nuclear power is not the answer to climatechange - it's costly, dangerous and a terrorist target."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Justthree years ago Blair conducted the biggest energy review in 60 years -which concluded renewable energy and energy efficiency, not nuclear, isthe way forward. Today's new review is simply a smokescreen for pushinghis new-found enthusiasm for nuclear power. It's like Iraq all overagain Blair makes his mind up then tries to spin his decision to theBritish people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2005/11/nuclearwronganswer.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real solution to climate change and energysecurity is a mix of efficient, safe and clean energy technologies likewind, wave, and solar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded, "Nuclear power is simply adangerous red herring in this debate. Even if the UK replaced all 23 ofits operating reactors, we would only save 10 percent of our carbonemissions. In contrast the 56 billion pounds of tax-payers money beingused to fund the clean up of the UK's current nuclear sites could buyand install enough wind turbines to meet 20 percent of the UK'selectricity needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear power: wrong answer to climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclearpower has justifiably had a bad press in recent years. It's expensiveto the point of being uneconomic without massive government subsidies,produces dangerous radioactive wastes, and the consequences of aserious accident or terrorist attack on a nuclear plant could bedevastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry claims that nuclear reactors emit virtually no CO2 at the point of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delvea little deeper though, and the logic of this pro-nuclear argumentbegins to unravel. While it's true that most nuclear reactors do notemit carbon (although some nuclear plants actually do release CO2 gasbecause it is used for cooling), they are a small part of a nuclearfuel chain which most certainly does. The preparation of uranium forthe reactor involves a host of CO2 -emitting processes, including:mining and milling the ore; fuel enrichment and fuel-rod fabrication.Then there's the construction of the power station itself. At the otherend there's reactor decommissioning and the treatment, storage,transport and disposal of nuclear waste. All of this involves CO2emissions, which in some areas - such as fuel enrichment - aresignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this whole life-cycle is taken intoconsideration, the claim that nuclear power is a 'carbon-free'alternative to current fossil-fuelled power stations doesn't stand up.That's one of the reasons that the Kyoto treaty negotiations rejectedcarbon credits for nuclear power plants. The most recent studiesindicate that, for the richest uranium ores, CO2 emissions across thenuclear cycle are about 33 percent that of fossil-fuel plants. So farso good - but the fact is that very little uranium ore is of sufficientquality to produce such a result. Poor grades of ore have a content ofless than 0.02 percent uranium-235 (this is the uranium isotope whichis necessary to sustain the chain reaction in fuel in a nuclear powerplant). As the high grade ores are used up, the industry will becomeincreasingly dependent on lower grade ores - which will mean using moreand more energy to 'enrich' the level of uranium-235 in the fuel to alevel where it can be used in a reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Uranium is not a renewable resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knownuranium reserves will last for roughly 50 years at present consumptionrates, but the 438 plants operating world-wide produce only 16 percentof global requirements. If the world's entire electricity needs were tobe met by nuclear power, then reserves of high-grade uranium ore wouldbe used up within three to four years. Some estimates predict thatusing the remaining poorer ores in nuclear reactors could produce moreCO2 emissions than burning fossil fuels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a seriouslong-term energy source, nuclear power is a non-starter. But it haspowerful vested interests behind it which are sucking up funding thatwould be better spent on renewable solutions and energy conservation.As in the 1950s when the first generation of nuclear plants wereconceived, governments seem mesmerized by the glamour of nuclear power,and blinded to its obvious drawbacks. Any attempt to positionmainstream nuclear production as a solution to climate change would bea massive miscalculation, just at the time when we need to focus allour attention on the real solutions - energy conservation and renewablesources like wind, tidal and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Levi Strauss &amp; Co. today committed to go toxic-free. Why? Because you and hundreds of thousands of other people demanded that Levi’s “Go Forth and Detox”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox"&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" alt="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest denim brand joins ten other clothing companies that have made &lt;a href="/detox"&gt;credible commitments to Detox&lt;/a&gt;, including the world's largest fashion retailer, Zara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi's commitment comes just eight days after we launched our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Toxics-reports/Toxic-Threads-Under-Wraps/"&gt;“Toxic Threads: Under Wraps” report&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, and screened a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/because-we-fight-for-life/blog/43359/"&gt;documentary about a family&lt;/a&gt; struggling to hold factories in the region to account for the pollution they are causing, including suppliers of brands like Levi's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is living up to its claims of being a leader. Competitors that have so far failed to take responsibility for the pollution created along their entire supply chain are looking increasingly exposed. These include familiar big brands names such as Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A change of direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href="http://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Levi-Greenpeace-Detox-Solution-Commitment.pdf"&gt;commitment from Levi's&lt;/a&gt; is great news for people power and the environment. Levi's will begin requiring its largest suppliers (each with multiple facilities) in China, Mexico and elsewhere in the Global South to disclose pollution data as early as the end of June 2013. This means that's those living near all these facilities gain crucial access to information about discharges into their local environment – a basic right that up to this stage they had been denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than use hazardous chemicals in the first place, Levi's will look for non-hazardous alternatives. This is a bold move away from its previous position, which was focused on managing rather than eliminating hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition, the company has embraced the precautionary principle, which will be fundamental to shift the entire industry towards the adoption of non-hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toxic-free fashion is a trend to last the seasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 people have joined the Detox campaign since we re-launched in November, demanding toxic-free fashion and clean water. Fashionistas, activists, designers and bloggers took action on Twitter and Weibo, spreading news about the industry's toxic addiction and reaching many millions of friends and followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/buzz-screenshot.png" title="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Zara committed to Detox, then Mango and Esprit, as people around the world made their voices heard. Levi's was next on the shopping list, and in just eight days hundreds of thousands of people had called on the brand to match its bold proclamations with real actions. Activists and volunteers also took to the street in over 20 countries to take the message directly to the brand's customers and to speak with the staff working in their stores, who sent the message back to Levi's HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x173k1cRSzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has again shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while 11 top brands have now committed to Detox, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help spur on the next success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XxFWo4sCzCs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know brands like Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret monitor social media as closely as they monitor traditional media, and every time you like, share, comment on, or promote this video, it increases the pressure on these companies to change their ways: to stop poisoning rivers in the countries where their products are made, and stop shipping hazardous chemicals all over the world in their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A toxic-free world is possible. Together we can help create it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigners began a dialogue with Zara (a brand within the Inditex group) in 2011 about eliminating releases of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and clothes. But it wasn't until this week that the fast-fashion giant caught on to the urgent need to solve its toxic pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara has now committed to eliminate all discharge of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. And they're going to get rid of some of the worst chemicals, such as PFCs, even sooner. As a significant user of PFCs, Zara's commitment to eliminate this chemical group by the end of 2015 is a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox commitment announced today covers Zara and the seven other brands in the Inditex group: Pull &amp;amp; Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitment is good news for the environment, but also a breakthrough for the public's right to know what is being released into our waterways. Zara says that by the end of 2013 at least 100 of its suppliers in the Global South (including at least 40 in China) will publicly disclose data about their releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment. The open data will be chemical-by-chemical, facility-by-facility and at least year-by-year.&lt;/p&gt;

            Climbers unfurled a giant banner at Zara's store and Swiss head office in Geneva, tweeting live from their phones to ZARA and supporters. 

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/the-toxic-tale-behind-your-clothing/blog/43044/"&gt;launched the Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt; globally with a fashion show and press conference in Beijing. Related images and comments began to rise like a spring tide on social networks within hours of the story breaking. Zara's Facebook Page quickly filled with comments from fans calling on the company to Detox. Thousands of people began to share their desire for “fashion without pollution!” and demands for Zara to Detox on Twitter and Sina Weibo, China's leading microblogging site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see who's commenting about the campaign &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/zara/Detox-ZARA-Social-Media-Buzz/"&gt;on Twitter and Weibo in one place&lt;/a&gt; – people around the world speaking out in a dozen languages to a combined reach of more than 7.1m followers. On Twitter alone there were at least 43,800 mentions of Zara and the Detox campaign this week. More than 300,000 people signed up to join the campaign to Detox Zara, and many tens of thousands of people emailed and tweeted directly to the company for an ambitious Detox commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jWhLN0Ag_Dg" width="601" height="338" border="0" style="border:0px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/fashion-without-pollution-so-hot-right-now/blog/43128/"&gt;700 Greenpeace volunteers in 20 countries&lt;/a&gt; were out at Zara stores on Saturday. In the days before, climbers and other activists delivered the Detox message at Zara flagship stores and HQ buildings in Hong Kong, Budapest, Geneva, Hamburg and Madrid. Photos and videos of the actions have been trending on Twitter for days for searches like “Zara” and “Fashion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara's commitment to act more transparently is a milestone in the way clothing is manufactured. It's an important step in providing local communities, journalists and officials with the information they need to ensure that local water supplies are not turned into public sewers for industry. Zara's transparency revolution will be key to ensuring that as brands commit to Detox they then really follow through on achieving zero discharges by 2020. With so many businesses engaging in greenwashing, it's important for consumers to know who they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara now joins &lt;strong&gt;Nike, Adidas, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/Clickers-and-Stickers-Make-HM-Detox/"&gt;H&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/full-marks-for-marks-spencer/blog/42722/"&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/important-step-down-the-catwalk-to-toxic-free/blog/37928/"&gt;C&amp;amp;A and Li-Ning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; who have also committed to Detox but other top clothing companies still need to respond to the urgency of the situation and Detox. We tested &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/toxic-threads/"&gt;clothing items from 20 leading brands&lt;/a&gt; this year and found hazardous chemicals in them that break down in the environment to form toxic pollution. But by working with their suppliers and switching to non-hazardous alternatives, the clothing companies can become part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while Zara is a big fish, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation before our work will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fashion-lovers, activists, environmentalists, bloggers and celebrities will be back for more - toxic brands be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Here's how: &lt;/strong&gt;Watch, Like, and Share this animation aimed at getting the fashion industry to stop discharging hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	The first milestone of the Copenhagen Accord came and went, and with it no sign of the kind of targets for cutting global warming pollution needed to steer the world off the path towards catastrophic climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists called "Climate Shame" on Heads of State in as they fail to deliver a Real Deal in Copenhagen
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the Copenhagen Accord could possibly be a useful political declaration was if its January 31st deadline had been met with tougher new greenhouse gas emission targets. After all, its stated goal is supposed to be to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But governments tried to greenwash their failure at the UN Copenhagen climate summit by merely repeating existing targets and dressing them up as action. So far, these targets will fail to hold global warming to below 3 degrees C; an increase which threatens to have horrendous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it take for politicians to realise that time is running out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Masks off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious to everyone - even those who tried hard to pretend the world was saved after Copenhagen - that the Accord is a document barely worth the paper it is written on. It was put together quickly by politicians hoping to pass for leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving face - that was its purpose. Our climate was the least of politicians' concerns then, and obviously still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, Bernhard Obermayr, Head of the Climate and Energy Campaign, Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe said, "Today is the day for an obituary about the Copenhagen Accord's ability to protect the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where we stand now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do governments avoid the 2 degree C threshold from being breached?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret. By 2020, industrialised nations must cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels and developing countries need to reduce their projected growth in emissions by 15-30%. Further, the industrialised world needs to provide developing countries with new and additional funding of at least USD 140 billion annually to support clean energy and other mitigation activities, forest protection and adaptation. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; To give this package teeth, it must be set in a legally binding agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to Copenhagen, 15 million people called for a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty. We're still waiting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Associating' - since the Accord is not legally binding and was noted but not adopted by the UN Conference, associated is the best they can do - with the Accord, the European Union repeated its target of a 20 percent emissions cut against 1990 levels - old news, and only half of what is required. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/emission-targets-us-china-021209/"&gt; The US is sticking by the meagre 17 percent of 2005 levels&lt;/a&gt; but making that dependent of domestic legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the absence of leadership by the rich industrialised world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the lowest-lying Pacific island nations last week said it's going to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2020. Lying only 2 meters above sea level, the Marshall Islands is in danger of being washed off the map. In other words, the industrialised world has been shamed for its inaction by one of the most vulnerable nations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting the "dead" in "deadline"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 31st was a political deadline. We are approaching other deadlines though; ones that nature decides on and which politicians will not be able to talk their way out of. If global warming gets to the point where 'tipping points' are passed there will be no way for us to backtrack and undo the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-third-degree/"&gt; While three degrees of warming would likely be catastrophic.&lt;/a&gt; But even 2 degrees C risks possible partial, but irreversible deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet and even the West Antarctic ice sheet, that could eventually lead to sea level rise of several meters. Half-of-one degree more could lead to 20-80% loss of the Amazon rainforest and countless species that live in the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg" alt="" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the poorest and those least responsible for causing the problem who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The fight for survival of millions of people around the world and countless species of plants and animals is the brutal reality as permafrost melts, sea levels rise, tropical storms batter continents and once-fertile lands battle with floods or drought. But climate change knows no borders - we will all feel its impacts. It threatens economies, environments, human society and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/changethefuture"&gt;The Amazon, the Marshall Islands, Arctic sea ice - we stand to lose so much. Tell world leaders what exactly YOU can't stand to lose.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The world's #1 sportswear brand, Nike, has accepted our Detox challenge: today it has officially committed to eliminating all hazardous chemicals across its entire supply chain, and the entire life-cycle of its products by 2020. This is a major win for our campaign to protect the planet’s precious water, and create a toxic-free future.

&lt;p&gt;Nike's announcement comes just five weeks into our&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/detox"&gt; Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which began when we launched the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;" report, revealing commercial links between major clothing brands - including Nike, Puma and Adidas - and suppliers responsible for releasing hazardous chemicals into Chinese rivers. We challenged these brands to champion a toxic-free future by committing to work with their suppliers and remove these toxic chemicals from their clothes and China's rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nike sets a new pace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma was first&lt;/a&gt; to break away from the pack, opening up an impressive lead by announcing that it would go toxic-free. Puma's commitment to remove all hazardous chemicals from its entire product-portfolio must have left their competition wondering how they were going to raise their game. Now, Nike and Puma are the front-runners, and Adidas is far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike also agreed (&lt;a href="http://www.nikebiz.com/media/pr/2011/08/17_zero_discharge.html" target="_blank"&gt;their full statement&lt;/a&gt;) to address the issue of the public's "right to know" by ensuring full transparency about the chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The more the public knows about the toxic chemicals spilling out of these factories, the more the pressure to stop them polluting will increase. The importance of this cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sportswear giant has also promised to use its influence, knowledge and experience to bring about widespread elimination of hazardous chemicals from the clothing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tonight projected messages including, “Water Pollution Is Not Fair Play” and "The World Needs More Champions. Is Adidas All In?" to the almost 100,000 fans attending the Spanish Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (sponsored by Adidas) at the Nou Camp Stadium, in Barcelona, Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can Adidas top that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to clean up its act, Nike is showing hints of greatness - but we will be closely monitoring the company’s implementation plan, due to be published by 18 October. And just because Nike’s taking the lead shouldn’t mean Adidas or other clothing companies can simply throw in the towel. The game is still on and they should be hot on Nike's heels to become champions of a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas have a lot of ground to make up. If they want to be considered contenders, they need to get in the game by committing to zero discharge and really take the lead by developing a new culture of transparency throughout the clothing industry and helping others stop the release of hazardous chemicals currently used during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's like Green My Apple again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind the Detox campaign comes from a year-long investigation into the textile industry's water pollution problem in China, where vital research helped us to connect the dots and link hazardous chemicals and their impacts in waterways like the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas to textile factories and international clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these brands, one group stood out as the most likely to become champions of a toxic-free future: Leading sports clothing companies like Nike and Adidas. Not only do they like to market themselves as leaders and innovators, they also have the size and influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate the use and release of these hazardous chemicals from the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="366" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkou6xAb6Rw" width="590"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enormous task of changing the toxic practices of an entire industry can be extremely daunting, so we went in search of a potential leader with the will to change itself and the influence to change others. Much as we did during &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;our Green My Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was vital to engage with innovative and proactive industry leaders - the sort of companies who are willing to put their slogans into action and &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that "impossible is nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much encouraging by Greenpeace and Apple aficionados, in March 2009 Apple become the first laptop maker to eliminate toxic poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). For now we have only commitments from Nike and Puma, though they are on the right track and deserve recognition for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Detox campaign kicked off when our mysterious XM3N &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/xm3n-mannequins-reveal-their-mission-to-chall/blog/35757/"&gt;mannequins finally revealed their mission&lt;/a&gt; to clean up China's rivers. Their message was spread by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8OB68YeMmc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;our video&lt;/a&gt; – watched and shared by 100s of 1000s of Greenpeace supporters and sports lovers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people really started to get involved and the game was well and truly on. Actions from &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/es/noticias/Greenpeace-desafia-a-Adidas-y-Nike-a-liderar-un-futuro-libre-de-toxicos---/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/Nieuws_2011/Reusachtig-actie-T-shirt-aan-hoofdkantoor-Nike/" target="_blank"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/photosvideos/photos/Activistas-de-Greenpeace-cuelgan-los-trapos-sucios-de-Nike-y-Adidas-en-la-plaza-de-Callao-de-Madrid/"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; – including a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/hundreds-strip-to-challenge-nike-and-adidas-t/blog/35853/"&gt;world wide striptease&lt;/a&gt; – made sure the world’s biggest brands couldn’t ignore the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further pressure to perform was piled on by world’s media as the story ran far and wide, from New York to China and Brazil to the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/environmentalists-raise-awareness-with-coordinated-striptease-2326010.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. In Hong Kong&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our exhibit helped bring the message to the street where passers-by took a moment to put their demands for Detox in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people signed our petition to the CEOs of Nike and Adidas, many thousands of people have tweeted and shared the campaign on social networks and blogs, submitted logo designs, or contributed campaign ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Adidas have a tough act to follow, and everybody's watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What we're saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now stand at a 'climate crossroads'. We can go down the road of renewable energy and smart efficient use of energy, keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change or we can keep blundering on in the same direction into a fossil-fuelled future of extreme weather, drastic water shortages and desperate climate refugees. We cannot afford to take a wrong turn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this while phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear and without the use of unproven 'techno-fixes' like carbon capture and storage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Tara Buakamsri, Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our global energy concept means, that the investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a range of 300-350 billion dollars per year - almost equal to the amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To shift this money and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030, which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- SvenTeske, Greenpeace International climate and energy campaigner about the economic advantages of the energy [r]evolution scenario&lt;/p&gt;

Their mission: To cut through the greenwash, and highlight product ranges on the market which really are free of hazardous chemicals like PVC (vinyl) plastic and brominated flame retardants (BFR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CES is a major trade show where electronics companies come to demonstrate new products and jostle for industry media attention (which these days includes many technology blogs like &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;). Though it is not open to the public, CES say they expect over 140,000 attendees -- that's a lot of consumer electronics industry people in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first"&gt;In 2010, we should see significant developments, with products free of PVC and BFRs in the PC and TV markets. Any company failing to achieve this goal is taking a big gamble with its green reputation. On a positive note, it's good to see non-ranked companies beyond the PC and TV sectors, like Cisco, committing to eliminate these harmful &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics 14th Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; SonyEricsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; lead the way for product ranges free of the worsthazardous substances with &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/HP-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; HP&lt;/a&gt; following their lead. HP just released theCompaq 8000f Elite business desktop, its first completely PVC and BFRfree product, at CES 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/dell-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and LG Electronics (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;pick up penalty points in the Guide&lt;/a&gt; for failing to follow through on a promised phase-out of toxics in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies in our ranking guide had pledged to remove &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/" target="_blank"&gt;toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic and BFRs&lt;/a&gt; from their product range by the end of 2009, which would have meant a greater show of greener, toxic-free products for visitors to see at the CES. But, for now, it's a no show for these companies, who have delayed their phase-out to 2011 or beyond. No doubt they won't mention their backtracking to journalists and bloggers they meet at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's all the concern about toxic chemicals and e-waste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste and the wider community are exposed to significant health risks. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources, as routinely takes place in the backyards of China, India and much of the global South, can form dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumers want green, not greenwash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronics companies have been moving their "environmental information" links higher and higher on product information webpages in the four years since our first &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Green Electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is only greenwash though, and &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; informed consumers can tell the difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/news/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple cleared the final hurdle&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic, making it the first company to completely eliminate hazardous BFRs and PVC in its computer systems. Pressure from thousands of Apple lovers and advocates turned thecompany green in the time it took to go from iMac G5 (2006) to iMac Aluminum (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for a little less conversation and a lot more action on removing toxic chemicals." That's what our electronics campaigner, CaseyHarrell, is saying at CES. Apple, Sony Ericsson and Nokia are winning this game and HP is catching up, but the lack of action from other companies is ensuring that customers and the environment are still losing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ban the toxic stuff for good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies see their scores reduced in this edition of the Guide with the bar being raised on hazardous substances. Having endorsed the precautionary principle, companies now need to actively support bans on PVC, BFRs and chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs) during the revision of the European Union's &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electronics Directive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies need to support legislative bans to ensure a consistent phase out of PVC and BFRs across all electronic products," said Iza Kruszewska Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "Sony Ericsson and Apple are already calling on EU institutions to support such a ban. Other big players like HP and Dell, who have remained silent so far, and Acer need to ensure the ban is passed in the European Union parliament."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia leads the ranking, with a score of 7.3 out of 10. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; follows closely, and is the only company to score full marks on all the toxic chemicals criteria. In third place is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toshiba-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, but it risks losing points if it fails to meet its commitment to market new models of all its consumer electronics products that are free of PVC and BFRs by 1 April 2010. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; comes in fourth place, while Apple rises from ninth place to fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nintendo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; continues to languish at the bottom of theranking. Sony is rewarded for its reported 17 percent reduction ingreenhouse gas emissions over the period 2000-2008, with renewableenergy now accounting for 8 percent of the total energy purchasedglobally each year by the company, up from 2.5 percent a year ago. Italso gains for the reported use of 17,000 tons of recycled plasticsannually in various products, representing 10 percent of all plasticsused in the 2008 financial year. Almost 90 percent of this recycledplastic was post-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung twitter petition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung drops dramatically from second place to a tied seventh place for failing to eliminate BFRs in all its products by January 2010. With only its latest models of mobile phones free of toxic substances, it has set January 2011 as the deadline for eliminating them from new models of its notebooks and still has no definitive timeline for removing them from its TVs and household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Samsung's marketing people are touting their wares at CES, we'll be calling them out &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;on twitter with this petition&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;petition @Samsungtweets to follow Apple SonyEricsson and HP, and eliminate harmful chemicals like PVC &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;http://act.ly/1l1&lt;/a&gt; RT to sign #actly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If you live in a developed country, you’re pretty well insulated from climate change. Shifts in weather patterns, heavier rainfall, gradually rising sea levels and temperature increases – at the moment western society absorbs these changes without us really noticing much difference. But for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, living on the front line of climate change, shifts in the planet’s behaviour are much more obvious.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nenet girl, Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nenet people of the Yamal peninsula are nomadic reindeer herders who live within the Arctic circle on the northern coast of Siberia. In summer they graze their herds on the tundra of the peninsula, and in winter as the ground freezes they move south to milder parts of the Siberian steppes. They use the frozen surface of the landscape to cross the numerous freshwater lakes and marshes of the peninsula, which in summer they catch fish in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things are changing. The Arctic is the most sensitive area of the planet to climate change. While global average temperature has risen by around 0.8 degrees, some parts of Siberia have warmed by as much as 5 or 6. And so the Nenet have noticed the ground is freezing later and later in the year - and in some places, not freezing at all. The reindeer herders have to wait longer and longer before they can move their animals south across frozen ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, on the frontiers of the world, the warming of Siberia is already threatening a way of life that has remained fairly constant for thousands of years. It's not only that the Nenet have to move later in the year - many of the freshwater lakes that dot the landscape are leaking away as the frozen walls of earth that contain the water melt, and collapse. And so the Nenet are also losing the fishing that provides one of their main sources of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/melting-permafrost-in-yamal-pe.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eternal ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siberia is a landscape that's underpinned by frozen ground, called 'permafrost', but this ground is beginning to thaw. Off the coast, whole islands made of permafrost are literally disappearing as the arctic sea washes away the rapidly melting land. Melting permafrost is causing roads, pipelines and foundations to collapse across the country. Every year, there's an increase in the area of ground that melts in summer and the area that doesn't refreeze in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem in the Arctic. This melt has global implications, because it's going to speed up climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permafrost is like a giant frozen compost heap - full of dead plants, animals, trees and other carbon-rich organic matter, and in places it reaches 1.5km (one mile) deep. While it stays frozen, that carbon is locked up in the ground. But as the Arctic warms and the permafrost thaws, microbes start to break down that organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9_Qn8UrxuE?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaming lakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - probably causing, tonne for tonne, around 25 times more global warming over a hundred years than carbon dioxide.  By lighting escaping methane, scientists can capture dramatic images of plumes of flame bubbling up through holes cut into Siberian lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are adding more and more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which is accelerating climate change. Permafrost contains massive amounts of carbon - probably about twice what's currently in the atmosphere, and about 5 times more than all the human-caused greenhouse gases we've released. While we don't have a really clear understanding of how much carbon might be released as the permafrost melts, it's fair to say that any extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from melting permafrost are bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/copy-of-nenet-girl-yamal-peni.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the melting permafrost, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. And so we need strong political action from world leaders at Copenhagen. We need to control the warming that's leading the Arctic to melt away. It's probably too late to stop climate change ending the Nenet's traditional way of life for good. But if we don't act now, that's going to be the case for pretty much everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Voila! Stop tar sands en Français</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tar-sands-france091009/</url><text>
	Our tar sands campaign just spread from Canada to France when 30 Greenpeace activists entered Total’s refinery site, in Normandy, to highlight the involvement of the French oil company with the climate-changing tar sands in Alberta. Activists unfurled one banner on a huge tank, and two others on the 75 meter-high chimney stacks of the site's power station. The banners read "climate crime" and "Total invests in sustainable destruction."

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a global problem -- and this action is part of a global response to one of the worst climate offenders.  The world doesn't want Canada's dirty oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian "tourist" was also there participating in this action. Greenpeace activist Eryn Wheatley from Toronto was inside the Total refinery and occupying a large tank. She wanted to take a strong message across the Atlantic to Sarkozy and Europe -- that not all Canadian's support dirty oil, and real climate leaders shouldn't buy or fund tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not Canada's dirty secret anymore," said Eryn, from inside the Total site. "We're here today to expose an international climate crime. Sarkozy and other European leaders can't keep exporting the climate crisis to Canada. We need real leadership at Copenhagen and that means no more tar sands."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Totally criminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total S.A. has already invested more than 8 billion Euros in Alberta, and is planning to invest 10 billion more in the next decade, in Alberta and Madagascar, in order to step up its oil production from tar sands to 10 per cent of its global production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning's action follows &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; three weeks of intense actions in Alberta. Activists from France, Brazil, Germany and Australia descended on Canada's tar sands to draw attention to what they are calling a "global climate crime."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STOP tars sands, GO to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If production increases as planned, annual tar sands emissions are expected to quadruple to 126 million tonnes by 2015. In order to avoid runaway climate change we need to be drastically reducing these kinds of emissions - not increasing them. The best chance we have is coming up at the end of this year when the UN Climate Summit will be held in Copenhagen. World leaders must attend this meeting and agree to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will drastically reduce our emissions and prohibit projects like the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Apple makes a stand for climate. Who will join them?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a murmuring of discontent within the Chamber over its lobbying against &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-critical-of-draft-s"&gt; US climate legislation&lt;/a&gt;. It has rapidly gathered pace over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson publicly stated their opposition to the Chamber's stance earlier this year. The energy company PG&amp;amp;E left, closely followed by Excelon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple took the most radical step so far, announcing on Monday it was leaving immediately because it did not support the Chamber's position on Climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who will be next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies with high-profile climate positions must be shifting a little uneasily in the boardroom right now. Staying silent on this issue is definitely not showing the leadership Apple and others have shown by speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coolit"&gt;Cool IT Challenge&lt;/a&gt; specifically calls on the IT industry leaders to show real climate leadership. &lt;a href="~/link/0f310e3ab69544948af86fa86ecccf59.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="~/link/097a1c87e2c04f7ea4812ee7cb3cb7e1.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; IBM&lt;/a&gt; sit on the &lt;a href="http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/all.htm"&gt;Chamber board&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, both have a financial interest in tough laws on emissions: they sell technologies and software which would be needed to cut emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for IBM and Microsoft to speak out against the position of the Chamber -- or do what Apple did, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisive moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might ask why is this a big deal? Many members of the Chamber have at least in words expressed support for legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they pay dues to the Chamber that uses this money to lobby for exactly the opposite. It's not a small amount either -- the Chamber spent US$488 million between 1998 to 2007 on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly object to the Chamber's recent comments opposing the EPA's effort to limit greenhouse gases... Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and it is frustrating to find the Chamber at odds with us in this effort... we have decided to end our membership &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of money buys a lot of influence in Washington's corridors of power. The Chamber hasn't been shy about its position either. In August it stated it wanted to put the science of climate change on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chamber &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/scienceandsociety/2009/10/green-apple-firm-is-latest-to-leave-us-chamber-of-commerce.html"&gt; questioned Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;' personal judgement in deciding to leave. Rather than lecturing Steve on innovation, the Chamber should be focussing the innovation needed to reduce emissions and the jobs this will create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the growing public spat between Apple and the Chamber we are definitely cheering for Steve. But he could do with some more heavyweight support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which other IT executives are going to match Apple's bold move? The stakes have never been higher for the climate. Apple's move will throw an uncomfortable spotlight on any company that stays on in the Chamber but doesn't act to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science says we need deep cuts in emissions and that means significant reductions in US emissions and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/copenhagen-greenpeace-demands/"&gt; a strong global deal in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December. The most progressive businesses know emissions cuts are inevitable and are gearing up to help lead the global economy to a prosperous, low-carbon future. The Chamber's current position represents the voices of the past that got us into the climate crisis. It is time the biggest US companies stepped up to consign this position to  the dustbin of history, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/10/climate_trashing_chamber_lashe.html"&gt; More on this story on our blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/4a75882fea2c4e36941400692ea057b0.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Sign our petition to Google, IBM and Microsoft to call out the US Chamber of Commerce for its opposition to climate change legislation, or follow Apple's lead and quit the lobby group altogether.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;The bottom line is: we can't stop runaway climate change without you. Whatever you can give today will help us ensure there's a decent planet left for us all tomorrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We are thrilled to announce that one of our staff members, René Ngongo, has today been named a recipient of the 2009 Right Livelihood award.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rene Ngongo in Brussels 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo has been working closely with Greenpeace to save the Congo Basin Forests (the second largest tropical forest after the Amazon) since 2004, first in his capacity as head of OCEAN and now as Political Advisor for Greenpeace Africa when he led the opening of our first office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life story is an inspiring one. He grew up in Congo, near the Virunga National Park - a truly unique area with outstanding biodiversity which is included on &lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63"&gt;UNESCO's list of World Heritage in Danger&lt;/a&gt;. It was in these forests that he started to dream about becoming a Conservationist. He studied biology in the Kinsagani University where he also worked for several years. René also founded the highly-regarded Congolese NGO "OCEAN" (Organisationconcertée des écologistes et amis de la nature), which often served asa mediator between forest communities and key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the Congo Forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his work to protect the Congo Basin Forest from industrial loggers, René actively developed grassroots solutions and local contacts in remote villages. This infrastructure soon became the basis for educational activities on deforestation/reforestation and general environmental awareness building. Between 1994 and 2002, René developed tools to fight "slash and burn" agriculture. Among these tools were demonstration fields in Kisangani that showed local people possible alternative agricultural techniques. These allowed to diminish the pressure on the forests and provide better income alternatives to local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René coordinated the creation of a seedling plantation (20,000 seedlings) of the most exploited tree species in the Eastern province. This plantation provided trees for several 'green city' events. During these 'green city' (Ville Verte) events, trees were planted in abandoned parks, along avenues and in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of staying when you can leave is one of the most powerful things a person can do. During the brutal war that tore through Congo between 1996 and 2002, René didn't stop his efforts. He was one of luckier people who could have simply left the country, because of his network of friends outside Congo. Instead, he chose to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He monitored the use of natural resources by the different waring groups. During one of his 'green city' tree planting events on the outskirts of Kisangani, the war between Ugandan and Rwandan troops started. René and his invited guests had to search for cover from the artillery battle that suddenly started in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting against destructive logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that the DRC has returned to "relative" peace, more than ever, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/africa/problem/"&gt; the country's intact forests are threatened by large scale industrial projects such as logging&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a World Bank sponsored "reform" and a moratorium on new logging concessions that has been launched 7 years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMLYNmRc_I"&gt;companies continue to exploit the forest with impunity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly - if at all - paid and unequipped local control agents are unable to protect the massive old trees that are being logged and shipped to Europe and other international markets. But people like René continue the struggle against ecological destruction and social injustice. In his own words "Our forests are our livelihoods. They cannot be reduced to a cheap export commodity. For millions of people, the forests are their supermarket, their pharmacy, and the foundation of spiritual and physical health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Forests are also vital for our global climate&lt;/a&gt;. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from deforestation. In January 2009, the government concluded a legal review of 156 logging titles, and deemed 91 of them illegal. Despite this, some of the companies who have been not been validated continue logging today. Rene insists: "We have alternatives. We don't need to sell our forests for meager short term profits. We know today that our forests are worth more standing then logged, this is why we need a strong agreement and support for a global financial mechanism to reduce emissions and to end deforestation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Nobel Prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/"&gt;Right Livelihood Award&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the alternative Nobel Prize. It honours those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today. Several winners are announced every year and receive the prize in early December. We are beyond happy that Rene is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René's entire work is recgonised by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation today: "Since 1994,including through the civil war from 1996-2002, René Ngongo has engaged, at great personalrisk, in popular campaigning, political advocacy and practical initiatives to confront thedestroyers of the rainforest and help create the political conditions that could halt itsdestruction and bring about its conservation and sustainable use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the award, Greenpeace International Executive Director Gerd Leipold said: "While we hope President Obama turns his Nobel Peace Prize into real action for climate protection at this December's United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, it is people like Rene Ngongo who have already started the heavy lifting. People like René are the real climate leaders and it is good to know that at the very least one climate hero will be honored in Scandinavia this December."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Be part of Rene's life work: ask for protection of the forests for the sake of the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Global cattle giants unite to ban Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/global-cattle-giants-unite051009/</url><text>
	Today we have good news from the Amazon. Four of the biggest players in the global cattle industry have joined forces to reduce their carbon hoofprint and back our call for zero deforestation. JBS-Friboi, Bertin, Minerva and Marfrig are going to stop buying cattle from newly deforested areas of the rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Brazil's cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country’s leading carbon polluter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a direct result of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;', which we published less than 4 months ago. Since then, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies, including Adidas, Nike and Timberland worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan and committed to cancel contracts unless their products were guaranteed to be free from Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's announcement was made at an event in Sao Paulo, where each of the companies adopted new environmental and social standards to clean up their act and to ensure their products do not come from cattle raised in newly deforested areas of the rainforest. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Supermarkets (ABRAS), which includes Walmart and Carrefour, was at the announcement and supports the call for zero deforestation. Governor Blairo Maggi of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon and the largest cattle herd in Brazil was also there. Maggi announced that the state would support efforts to protect the Amazon and would provide high-resolution satellite images for monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making it work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures include the monitoring of supply chains and clear targets for the registration of farms that both directly and indirectly supply cattle as well as measures to end the purchase of cattle from indigenous and protected areas and from farms using slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country's leading carbon polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the United Nations General Assembly in September, President Lula announced a target of 80 percent reduction in deforestation by 2020 for Brazil. Deforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world's trains, planes and cars put together. A good climate deal will only be effective if it successfully tackles emissions from both fossil fuels and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 62 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil is ready and committed to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders to attend this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and there agree to an effective deal to avert the impending climate crisis. To keep global temperatures at safe levels, the deal must include the funds needed to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US $140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, so that developing countries can prevent and adapt to climate change. Approximately US $40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2015 in Brazil and Indonesia and by 2020 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>World leaders block Arctic coal shipment </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/</url><text>
	Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and other world leaders took non-violent direct action today against a coal mine in Svalbard, denouncing the fossil fuel that is powering the meltdown of the Arctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders know they need to quit coal to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now THAT's the kind of headline we want to see in newspapers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Obama, Merkel and their friends are not really in Svalbard. Activists, wearing face masks, are doing what world leaders should be doing: stopping coal, the single biggest man-made cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of world leaders, it was left to our activists once again to take action. We started blocking the conveyer belt of the Svea mine, which was bringing coal to the  transport ship &lt;em&gt;MV Pascha&lt;/em&gt;, early this morning. Activists stopped operations by occupying a loading crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 10AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists are being removed from the coal loading site by police now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked operations throughout the night in minus 15 temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're sending a message from one of the places most affected by climate change: a message of urgency to the real world leaders.Banners reading "Coal Climate Crime" and "Coal Powered Arctic Meltdown" are now hanging from the coal crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svea mine is located at 77 degrees North and is one of the closest mines to the North Pole. Coal is exported from here to Europe where it is used to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature outside is below freezing and polar bears are roaming around but our activists are determined to stay on the conveyer belt as long as they can - to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/22_activists_are_now_blocking.html"&gt;Check out the live feed of updates from Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal fired Arctic meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise has been in the Arctic since June, hosting top scientists to document the effects of climate change in the region. They have found that Greenland's glaciers are losing ice at an accelerated rate. In September, the Arctic sea ice reached the third lowest minimum extent on record. The Arctic is melting down faster than scientists have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea-level rise could impact the homes of one in ten people on the planet this century. This coal-fired madness must stop. Our Energy [R]evolution report presents a realistic scenario showing how we can phase out coal fired power plants by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: take action (for real this time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just 66 days, the countries of the world will come together to negotiate a new climate treaty. World leaders need to take real action by personally committing to attend the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and to delivering a fair, ambitious and binding deal to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/call4copenhagen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;We need real leaders at the UN climate summit this December in Copenhagen. Join the global call for them to personally attend the meeting and ensure a fair, ambitious and binding treaty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Sending a ship to the Arctic isn't cheap. We've only been able to do it with support from people like you. Take the opportunity to make a difference for tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our jaws hit the deck and we all fell out of our inflatables when we got word that Presidents Obama, Lula, Zapatero and Prime Minister Hatoyama were going to show up in Copenhagen. And then we found out that instead of showing up in Copenhagen for the UN Climate Summit in December, world leaders were actually going to be there today, 2 months ahead of schedule, to lobby the Olympic Congress for their cities to host the 2016 Games.

            Acitivists make sure President Obama knows that his presence is required again in December at the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure the world leaders knew that their presence is required again in December, activists hung a huge reminder from the St Nicholas Church Tower reading "Obama: Right city, wrong date". The tower overlooks the church square where President Obama will be meeting with the Danish Prime Minister and Royal Family later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Olympic spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play is exactly what is missing from the current climate negotiations. Obama needs to help set a new pace in the climate negotiations, leading from the front instead of coasting at the back," said Jon Burgwald, Greenpeace Nordic climate campaigner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going for gold in December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to go for gold in December, and the big question is will Obama be a team player? Now that Obama, Lula and Zapatero all know where Copenhagen is they should have no problem making their way back in December, to lead the talks to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that averts a climate catastrophe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of state have to show up to the climate summit in December if we want a fair and binding climate deal. The promises that are on the table need to improve significantly, and that can not be done by delegations or environmental ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country in the world takes part in the Olympics, every country aims to win. No country will be free from unchecked climate change. Unless world leaders agree to avert climate chaos, we are looking at mass starvation, mass migration and mass extinction. Without the required leadership we will all be losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; - 26 activists have been arrested placing other banners around Copenhagen reminding the world leaders they need to come back to Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;The UN Summit in Copenhagen is less than 9 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate and show up to Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We will continue to fight to get world leaders to take responsibility and show up at the UN Summit in Copenhagen. We don't accept money from governments or corporations so we rely on support from individuals like you.

	Yes, it’s true, we do indeed have scientists.  And some days, we even let them out of the lab. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/dr-paul-johnson.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Dr Paul Johnson
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days.  Our Greenpeace Chief Scientist, Dr Paul Johnston, has travelled from our international laboratory at the University of Exeter, UK to Ottawa, Canada to further our campaign to create a global network of marine reserves to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has worked with scientists ever since the organisation's founding days in the early seventies.  Recently, some of the world's best scientists have sailed on the Arctic Sunrise to monitor the growing threat to the Arctic region from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnston is attending the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Ottawa to stand up and defend the oceans. Greenpeace wants to see 40 percent of the world's oceans fully protected through a global network of marine reserves. We are aiming high with our 40 percent goal, as the &lt;a href="http://www.wdpa-marine.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;World Database on Marine Protection&lt;/a&gt; reports that currently, less than 1 percent is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1 percent, the majority of marine and coastal protected areas are situated within country Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), leaving the high seas devoid of protection. Even more startling, is the fact that only 12.8 percent of protected areas can be considered as true marine reserves, meaning closed to all extractive activities including fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the CBD put ink on paper, pledging to establish a global network of marine reserves by 2012. Five years later however, the pledge is still struggling to make it off the page and into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years we've been trying to help governments designate areas for protection -mapping it all out for them in the Roadmap to Recovery, launched at the CBD in Brazil in 2006.  Last year, the CBD adopted criteria to identify areas for protection, which were very similar to our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with two case studies on how marine reserves could work in the Pacific and Mediterranean, Dr Johnston will be giving advice on how to implement the criteria to identify areas for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships have been in action in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/bluefin_tuna_action_in_turkey.html"&gt; Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/voices_of_pacific_activists_te.html"&gt; Pacific&lt;/a&gt; this year - highlighting the need for protection, especially confronting overfishing of tuna stocks which are decreasing at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Dr Johnston will show in Ottawa, change can be made to protect our oceans. We have the solutions, we just need governments to hear us out and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently 160,761 supporters have helped us be heard and defend the oceans by signing our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt; Marine Reserves Petition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know what you buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species"&gt;If you're a fish consumer, check the red list before buying fish to make sure the fish has been sustainably fished. Tell your retailer if they don’t know where it came from, you don’t want it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments. This means we rely on individuals like you to continue working towards a safer climate for everyone. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Green points for Hewlett Packard and Apple</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hp-gets-the-message-30-10-09/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;HP's penalty point lifted in latest Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Apple and Hewlett Packard get green points this month, as HP is rewarded in the latest edition of our Guide to Greener Electronics and Apple releases details of their greenhouse gas emissions. But the big points go to activist consumers for proving once again that public pressure creates positive change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When the gadgets we use go to Delhi for recycling, their toxic contents end up in acrid smoke.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; ranks the 18 top manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones, TVs and games consoles according to their policies and practice on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is published quarterly. We went to press before &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment" target="_blank"&gt;Apple's updated environmental information&lt;/a&gt; was published last week, but the welcome news of their transparency about greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental disclosures will be factored in to the next edition. Apple can justly pat itself on the back for listening to their customers who asked for greener gadgets. And all you Apple users should pat yourselves on the back for asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard had their penalty point lifted by putting a personal computer on the market that is virtually free of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/"&gt; PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, or vinyl plastic) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs)&lt;/a&gt;. Only the power supply unit and cable still contain these hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP back on track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP made a commitment in 2007 to have all PC products toxic-free in 2009, but went soft on that commitment earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we painted a protest on Hewlett-Packard's roof saying that HP stoodfor "Hazardous Products," and organized a phone-in protest with thevoice talents of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/breaking-green-promises" target="_blank"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;.With the new &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090915xa.html" target="_blank"&gt;HP ProBook 5310m notebook&lt;/a&gt;, HP has made the first step incatching up with Apple, which eliminated these materials from itsentire product line almost a year ago, and now puts pressure squarelyon HP's competitors to put more products on the market that are cleanerand safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; are still ahead on toxics removal, having eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, partly as a result of our "Green my Apple" campaign which brought consumer pressure to bear from people who loved their Macs, but really wished they came in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow learners: Dell and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and Lenovo each retain a penalty point for delaying their phase-out commitments indefinitely. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/acer-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will still achieve its target for eliminating PVC and BFRs in all products by the end of this year. Meanwhile Toshiba has a timeline to phase out these toxic substances from all its products by the end of March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top of the class: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Philips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; remains at the top of the ranking, with a score of 7.5 out of 10, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; with 6.9, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; with 6.5 and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; -- which leaps from 7th to 4th place -- with 5.9 points. The other climber is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sony-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt;, rising from 12th to 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow-footed: LGE, Fujitsu and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt; plummets from 4th to 11th position, weighed down by a penalty point for flip-flopping on its promise to get off the toxic sauce by the end of 2010 - now, only its mobile phones will be free of these PVC and BFRs by then, while phase-out in TVs and monitors has been delayed until 2012. At the bottom of the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fujitsu-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, with a score of 2.7, overtakes &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from 16th to second-last place with a score of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world needs climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition of the guide -- which also ranks companies on climate and energy criteria -- is released just two months before crucial climate change talks take place in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these powerful tech companies to stand by their claims and set examples of strong leadership for other industries to follow. It's encouraging that Philips, Acer and Samsung support the levels of greenhouse emissions cuts required to stem dangerous climate change. However industry giants like Apple, Nokia and Microsoft are failing to show climate leadership by making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take a quick survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=5uAfaHmYlBd_2fqhPFvjeTnQ_3d_3d"&gt;We'd like to ask you a few questions to help make our next hi-tech climate campaign a success. Got a minute? Please take the survey!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            SolarChill prototypes - the vaccine cooler and the refrigerator.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.solarchill.org/index.html"&gt;SolarChill&lt;/a&gt;
was born through separate discussions between Greenpeace,the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World
HealthOrganization. The big challenge: providing affordable
andenvironmentally safe refrigeration for the maintenance of
vaccines andmedicines, and the preservation of food, in parts of
the world thathave no electricity or have unreliable supplies of
electricity. At themoment refrigerators in developing countries
usually use kerosene,propane and to far lesser extent, solar power.
Vital medicine ismost often stored in unreliable kerosene
refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kerosene and vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerosene refrigerators consume about 1 litre of kerosene daily.
Notonly do they emit unpleasant fumes, theyoccasionally catch fire,
they need to be regularly fuelled up, andthey are often not
reliable for maintaining the required vaccinetemperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they are also environmentally harmful as the burning
ofkerosene contributes to global warming. There are approximately
100,000kerosene refrigerators in use today around the world for
coolingvaccines, which means they produce approximately between 73
and 91million kilograms of CO2 each year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What about solar power?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar Vaccine Coolers are already in use in parts of the world
thatlack electricity, and they have proven to be more reliable than
theirkerosene counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are only approximately 6,000 solar vaccine
coolersaround the world today. Two big problems: they rely on
batteries, whichare expensive and toxic to make and dispose of, and
they cost more than kerosene coolers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a solar cooler today is in the US$3500 to US$4500
range. Incomparison, the cost of the SolarChill package, cooler and
solar panelscombined, is projected to come in around US$1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The birth of SolarChill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, at about the same time as we were talking with
UNEP andWHO, the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) began the
development ofa new solar refrigerator that bypassed the use of
batteries. We decidedto join forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided the funds for the development of the first
SolarChillprototypes. These were exhibited at the World Summit on
SustainableDevelopment in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so special about these refrigerators?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="179950" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarChill refrigerators don't need batteries or a connection to
theelectrical grid - they store power in three 60W voltaic panels.
They dohowever have an AC/DC converter, which provides flexibility
to usewind, hydropower, bio-gas or grid energy (and even a
carbattery!) when there is not enough sun. The coolers are also
energy efficient because theyhave excellent insulation. They don't
contribute to globalwarming thanks to the special hydrocarbon
system made by our friends atDTI and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even maintaining a constant temperature, important where
medicine isconcerned, doesn't need an electronic controller - it is
managedthrough natural convection methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single SolarChill unit can serve a population of 50,000 people
forpreserving vaccines, and will be 50 - 60 percent cheaper than
currentsolar refrigerator models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Can I buy one for my new kitchen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet ... a second generation of prototypes of the SolarChill
VaccineCooler went into field testing at the beginning of 2004 in
Senegal,Indonesia and Cuba. 10 prototypes of the chest freezer
vaccine coolerare being tested under a variety of climatic
conditions, including atthe DTI laboratory in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans call for similar field testing of the upright freezer
SolarChill Food Refrigerator in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the technology will be made freely available
tomanufacturers around the world, so we hope that after that
SolarChillwill be available in both developing countries and your
localdepartment store.&lt;/p&gt;

	What is soon to be bigger than England and account for more greenhouse gas emissions than the Czech Republic? The tar sands of northern Alberta, Canada - the largest energy project and the largest industrial project on the face of the planet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what unrestrained fossil fuel development and unchecked emissions looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning of September 15th 25 Greenpeace activists enteredthe Albian tar sands operation and proceeded to blockade themselves inthe cabs of two dumptrucks and one crane. They remained on the site for30 hours, successfully shutting down the entire operation and sending astrong message: the &lt;a title="tar sands" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tarsands"&gt;tar sands are a climate crime&lt;/a&gt; and they must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tar sands - sometimes referred to as oil sands - are one of thedirtiest sources of oil on the planet, and extracting thisunconventional oil resource has created a truly hellish landscape. Vastareas of wilderness are chewed up andreplaced by toxic lakes, open pit mines, refineries, andpipe lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting tar sands deposits is hugely energy intensive and produces emissions to the tune of &lt;strong&gt;100 million tonnes of carbon per day&lt;/strong&gt;. Worse, most deposits are located underneath boreal forestwhich must be completely destroyed to extract the tar sands whichfurther accelerates climate change. TheCanadian boreal forest is a huge carbon storehouse, and emissionsresulting from this deforestation have yet to be included in theofficial emissions. Not that the atmosphere cares about the officialnumbers. It is clear that tar sands development ispushing us towards catastrophic, runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate leaders don't buy tar sands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that world leaders still need to get the message. We will continue to expose the horror of the tar sands until they face the urgent facts and wean themselves off the brutal addiction to fossil fuels which threatens us all with catastrophic climate change," Mike Hudema, Climate Campaigner with &lt;a title="gp canada" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Canada&lt;/a&gt;, commented from the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the mining site, Greenpeace will continue to bear witness to the total devastation that is the tar sands. The message going into critical UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December is that climate leaders don't buy tar sands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockade coincided with the release of climate demands from the world's largest global investors - who issued a &lt;a title="statement" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for 'strong action this year from international policy makers in the fight against global warming.' Signed by 181 investors in total - this is the largest statement of its kind in history and shows that the future lies in a green, sustainable energy industry - not in the tar sands. It also makes clear the expectations investors have for world leaders this year. It was issued 80 days before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - which is the best chance the world has to agree to serious emissions cuts and strong climate policy that will avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's recently released 'Green Jobs' report shows that this green energy future is not only possible, but it is beneficial to jobs in the energy sector. It is the first ever jobs analysis of a clean energy scenario made on a global scale and is part of Greenpeace's &lt;a title="energy rev" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario. &lt;a title="working climate" href="/international/en/publications/reports/working-for-the-climate/"&gt;Working for the Climate&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that the shift to a renewable-energy based global system would be our best bet for environmental, energy and job security. By 2030 the report projects we could have &lt;strong&gt;8 million renewable and efficiency power sector workers&lt;/strong&gt;, while in contrast, if we continue with business as usual the energy sector would lose jobs - 500,000 of them by 2030. The choice is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A poster child for climate destruction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of the tar sands bring home exactly how devastating and destructive this energy project is for the environment. The toxic lakes created by water discharged from the extraction process are so vast they can be seen from space, and so toxic that cannons have to be regularly let off to scare away wildlife. This does not stop 11 million litres of leakage to occur per day. Even worse than what has already been done is the pace at which tar sands development is expected to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

The projections made are frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tar sands emissions are bigger than Estonia and Lithuania right now andin 2020 will be larger than countries like Belgium, Austria, Irelandand Denmark," explains Nikiforuk. These are daunting figures which make it all the more pressing that our world leaders take responsibility and act on climate change. They could learn a thing or two from the 25 activists that successfully shut down the Albian mine operations. One of the activists had this to say afterwards: "We look atour logo 'Stop the tar sands' which seemed so extreme a week ago - andnow it seems possible."&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.

            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you
couldstill see the occasional grand fig tree. Kids rushed up and
hugged us.I sensed that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the seeds for a safer life are already here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message to the Prime Minister&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;72% of the Turkish public wants Turkey to be nuclear-free.  Ask the Prime Minister to make it so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give peace a chance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us keep the Peace Embassy going and our activists around the world working for an end to the nuclear threat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.

            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The city of Ulsan, Korea has ordered us to vacate our "Whale Embassy" -- built near the site of a planned whale meat factory.  We've told them we'll be happy to leave, once they assure us they will not build the factory.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea ... with campaigner Jim Wickens on the phone as usual! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, we uncovered plans by the Korean government to
build awhale meat factory in Ulsan.  The discovery added togrowing
evidence that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea wants to reopen commercial whaling.&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We established our Whale Embassy to open a dialogue with local
peopleabout the government's plans, to explain just how many people
aroundthe world oppose whaling, to call for a cancellation of plans
to buildthe factory,  along with assurances that Korea will not bow
topressure from Japan to resume commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had visitors and volunteers from the local community, the
NewZealand Ambassador stopped by, and a great deal of local
pressattention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City officials embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But City officials are not at all happy with us tarnishing
theirreputation as the "City of whales" with our suggestion that
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ulsan isactually heading toward becoming the "City of whaling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Oureviction notice stated they want usto leave because they
claim we are in the way of the proposed Oceans Day ceremony on May
31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have given us until Monday, May 16th to get off the
site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stifling criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale campaigner Jim Wickens says: "It is quite clear that they
want tostifle any criticism of their plans to build the factory.
Today theyshowed us plans of the Oceans Day ceremony being planned,
and on theentire 15,000 square-metre site, they don't have any room
for ourlittle embassy.  We have told them that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;any attempts to evict usforcibly will reflect very badly on their international image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been several attempts at intimidation,
official andunofficial. According to Wickens: "Last night at four
in the morningfour local fishermen turned uplooking for trouble,
luckily there were others awake to come and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been tipped off that in Korea in &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;sensitive political protests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,thugs are often allowed to do the dirty work. There is a
possibilitythat this may take the form of fake fishermen coming to
beat us up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries has &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/"&gt;sent a
fax to ourheadquarters in Amsterdam claiming we are distorting the
truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Hygienic" butchering of "accidental" whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
They say that the whale meat factory will merely be a sanitary
measure-- a way to hygienically butcher the whales which are
"accidentally"killed by becoming entangled in nets, and those which
might be killedin a possible programme of "scientific whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="accidental whale kills" align="middle" height="235" width="400"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea allows the commercial sale of whale meat fromaccidental
kills.  The Ministry didn't respond to our observationthat &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea and Japan individually in 2003 caught more whales byaccident than all the fishing fleets in the world combined reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor did they comment on the stories that local people have told
usabout some methods fisherman use to "accidentally" catch
whales:ramming them with the ship to cause massive internal
injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="137081" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With our own eyes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We witnessed the butchering of a juvenile minke whale which
was"accidentally" caught.  The whale meat was packaged up for sale
ata value of US$30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At prices like that, you can well imagine why a city official
might want to build a whale butchering factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who can stop the whale meat factory is Ulsan mayor, Mr.
Park Maeng-woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local businessmen, such as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;deputy vice president of Hyundai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, havebeen vocal supporters of the whale meat factory,
apparently unaware ofthe brand damage which other multinational
corporations have sufferedwhen they've been exposed as having a
close association to whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea hosts the International Whaling Commission meeting this
year inJune. The meeting that could open the doors to a return to
commercialwhaling, which has been banned since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tell the mayor to stop the whale factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're trying to warn Mr. Park Maeng-woo just how passionate
peoplearound the world are about saving whales -- how much his
town'sreputation, the reputation of Hyundai corporation, and the
reputationof his country are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1770&amp;amp;s=gen2"&gt;You
can help us let the Ulsan mayor know&lt;/a&gt; just how important it is
toGreenpeace supporters worldwide that he make the right decision
andcancel the whale meat factory. &lt;/p&gt;

	On different continents in two very different communities, Paul and Ruby are battling Dow Chemical's refusal to take responsibility for its legacy of pollution, shady dealings and disregard for human life.  In Part 3 of our feature, we hear from Paul and Ruby as they strengthen their resolve to keep up the fight - wherever they are in the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Local families play beside the river unaware that  it is being polluted by effluent from Dow's plant up stream.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Ruby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The world is progressing at a new speed these days - but does anyone stop to think what sacrifices are made at the altar of this progress? We cannot even begin to estimate the many things that we have sacrificed in the name of progress; technology may have made our lives simpler, but the very same technology can be misused for destructive purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are focussed only on their profits, to the extent of being inhuman - and Union Carbide (now owned by Dow Chemical) is the prime example of these. In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my college in Bhopal, my friends and I spend most of our free time discussing the corporate crimes of Union Carbide in Bhopal. Most of my classmates are residents of other states, and knew very little about Bhopal before coming here. In fact, they only knew what the newspapers had told them about the Bhopal gas disaster. But I have related my story to them, and revealed the fact that the disaster was not an accident, but a premeditated acceptance of the 'risks' and a callous approach towards safety systems that 'cost too much' to be kept in operation. Once they have heard the full story, there is an almost unanimous understanding that none of us would ever want to work for a firm like this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="257" height="55" align="left"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates and I recently attended a seminar on health problems of survivors. My classmates were very moved by this seminar, and offered to help out with putting up posters, inviting people to the subsequent programmes and generally spreading the word. In fact, they all told me that they were keen to help our campaign for justice in Bhopal whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, we were all sitting around and talking about our experience with this seminar, when someone came up with a brilliant suggestion - why not form a youth club to support the Bhopal campaign, and to oppose the work of irresponsible companies like Dow in other parts of the country! I knew this would prove to be a brilliant idea, because the power of youth joining our campaign would make a world of difference to the campaign. It will also ensure that the campaign gets another lease of life, with a new generation joining in to take it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read Paul's story, it seemed almost eerie - to think that he is going through almost the same kind of battle that our community is, and that too, because of the same company. His story and mine seem disturbingly similar. When I read his story, it seemed as if were both living in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's story also strengthened my resolve further - I am now convinced that the battle against Dow Chemicals needs to be fought on the global scale, and spread the word, involve more youngsters in the campaign, and fight them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely wish Paul and his community all the very best in their struggle. Maybe we can swap emails with ideas and tactics to help both our campaigns. While writing my own serial stories, and reading Paul's stories, I have realized the global nature of our campaign. I also feel like I have found a friend in Paul, learnt about his life, and presented our two different, yet similar stories to the millions of readers who log onto the Greenpeace website from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that in 20 years time, when we are both in our 40's we can reflect on the day Dow accepted its responsibilities and did the right thing in Bhopal and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Paul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since I found out Dow Chemical had quietly been polluting the area around my home for years I have been constantly amazed by this company. I have to give it credit for the amount of hard work and millions of dollars it spends in order to make the public believe it is a responsible company. Rather than tackle the pollution problems of its own making it does all it can to avoid this. Its story is the same be it here in the US or in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered Dow had polluted areas downstream of its [Michigan] plant with levels 9000 times the state clean up levels the Dow denial machine went into overdrive. First it denied it caused the pollution. Next it hired the best PR firms and lawyers and lobbied local politicians to ensure it didn't get the blame. Even so it was proved that Dow caused the pollution. Oops! So then it spends more money on PR, lawyers, and lobbying politicians to say dioxin is harmless. But test results prove levels are dangerously high. Dow now spends money on more PR, trying to spin the test results. It even tried but failed to get the state of Michigan to raise the clean up levels, in an attempt to instantly make the problem disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="297" height="119" align="right"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this denial, lobbying and muddying of these dirty waters costs Dow millions. Just imagine if it had owned up straight away and spent this cash on tackling the problem. That is what the affected communities and I are fighting for. We don't have millions of dollars or fancy lawyers but we have the most powerful weapon - the truth on our side. I am campaigning for a clean up of the river, and ideally medical monitoring of all contaminated individuals' health. Would it have been smart to admit to the dioxin contamination and clean up the problem at the outset, so saving Dow millions? Yes, for sure! I don't understand Dow's thinking, it must have some egotistical management that doesn't like to be proven wrong, maybe that is why they refuse to clean up the river. If only women ran Dow, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything Dow does is wrong and some people in the area have benefited from Dow's presence. But I firmly believe that Dow can make a profit without trashing the environment and harming peoples health. Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth and refuse to except law and moral responsibility for their business actions. Couldn't Dow just take one years profits and instead of giving it to lawyers, PR firms, politicians or shareholders, resolve the problems of its own making? That is all I ask and many others the world over would like to know. Is that a lot to ask for? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposing side will probably say, people like me don't understand business and just want to harm Dow. But it seems Dow can do this itself with poor judgments involving the use of its money. I am not trying to destroy businesses; I just feel a business should have some moral values, at least one moral value. A business shouldn't destroy the lives of others in order to make a few extra bucks. No person or company should do that. A company should respect its workers and their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby shouldn't have to wait 20 years or more for justice after the disaster in Bhopal. People in Michigan shouldn't have to fight against a company and the state in order to enforce state laws. People in government have obviously failed both the citizens of Bhopal and in Michigan, they bend over for Dow at any chance they get, thinking of only themselves. How many more people have to die in Bhopal in order for clean up and how many more silent and slow deaths caused by dioxin pollution do the citizens of Michigan have to face? Sadly enough for me and Ruby, it seems both of our countries value profits over precious life. One can make and create all the money he or she desires, but one can't recreate an aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, or mom and dad after they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/bhopal-disaster-twenty-years/"&gt; part one of the feature&lt;/a&gt; to understand the terrible events that lead to Ruby and Paul and thier communities being affected by toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year the planet awes us with meteorological phenomena, like monsoons in Asia and hurricanes off the Americas. But however devastating these have been, there was at least some form of continuity and predictability in their seasonal appearances. Now it seems that predictability is a thing of the past, with cases of extreme weather on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Japan suffered from its third typhoon in three weeks. It is the fourth major storm to hit Japan since late August, and is reportedly the most powerful to hit Okinawa since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor harvests, caused by this summer's bad weather and flash floods, are having serious consequences for farmers in northern Europe. Entire fields have been left to rot due to the summer's heavy rainfall. Some countries have had their wettest summer months on record. In 2003, dry weather provided a bumper harvest, but the havoc caused by this year's torrential storms could also reach into 2005, thanks to seed and soil damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more scientists are indicating that climate change is to blame for these recent erratic weather patterns. The concentration of CO2 (the main greenhouse gas) in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34 percent above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report examing the impacts of Europe's changing climate. The report suggests that between 1975 and 2001, the annual number of flood events increased and that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years will see Europe experiencing more frequent and economically costly storms, floods, droughts and other extreme weather. While there will be wetter conditions in northern Europe, the south will have drier weather, threatening agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heat waves, pose a lethal threat to the elderly and frail, as occurred in the summer of 2003. Melting European glaciers are also an issue with EEA report estimating that three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps are likely to disappear by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hotting up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 ºC per decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, serious flooding in 11 countries killed around 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least US$15 billion. In the summer 2003 heat wave, western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30 percent. Melting reduced the mass of Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. Who knows what the economic and social costs of summer 2004 will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hurricanes too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's hurricane season has dramatically shown the danger of a world with increasingly extreme weather. Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances and now Ivan have made landfall in the Caribbean and Florida. In March, a hurricane hit the Brazilian coast - the first ever recorded in the South Atlantic. These storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and killed scores of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming larger and more damaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of global warming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans started heating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by while hurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet - gather strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that the Earth is getting hotter-and fast. The real question is will we slow the meltdown by curbing our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Stay away from ExxonMobil/Esso!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;ExxonMobil/Esso is the most active company in trying to kill any action on climate change. Exxon has secured court injunctions in several countries to keep us away from Exxon property. We're actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso properties! To make sure we're all clear about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away&lt;/a&gt;. Tell them you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are two more things you can do now:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Kids for Forests in action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kids-for-forests/</url><text>
	A lot of important politicians are currently doing a lot of talking about preserving the diversity of life on Earth at a global UN meeting. Unfortunately talking is just about the only thing they have been doing to preserve life on Earth for the last 12 years. Future generations will have to live with the consequences of current inaction. That is why kids from regions threatened with destructive logging are in Malaysia to speak truth to the bureaucrats.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A teenager from Cameroon (foreground) and a girl from Canada (background) at the UN Summit for Life on Earth (Convention on Biological Diversity.) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the world's ancient forests are being logged towards
oblivion. The culprits are logging companies, often acting
illegally, which are turning thousand-year-old forests into quick
profits. The members of our Kids for Forests Delegation see this
destruction of our shared future in their own regions. They have
come to Malaysia, to the meeting of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), to convince politicians to turn words into
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the delegates Omanie Sakespeso, 18 came all the way from
Papua New Guinea to plead with delegates to help save his home from
international logging companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." title="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56764"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
forest is my life and logging companies are taking my life away.
The creeks that we used for medicine are contaminated and our
burial sites have been destroyed by heavy bulldozers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omanie pleaded with the delegates: "You must carry out your duty
and protect my last remaining tropical rainforest. It is my first
time out of my country and I came all this way to tell you that you
need to take action now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Forests - furniture or a future?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last CBD in The Hague, 2002, delegates heard politicians
promise to stop the destruction of species worldwide by 2010. In
that time Kids for Forests have continued their campaign to elevate
the level of awareness among their peers on the issues of forest
destruction and ocean degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." title="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56761"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Clara
Buer, 21 from Germany who gave a speech in The Hague two years ago
is not impressed with the lack of action taken by the international
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Two years ago in The Hague I stood before you. Two years ago
you promised to stop the loss of life on earth. But in two years
nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am deeply disappointed, but I am back. Because young people
never give up fighting for their future and because I still believe
this place is the right place to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forests project" title="Kids for Forests project" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56749"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Your
promise is worth nothing, if you allow the ancient forests to be
boiled to paper or turned into furniture. Your promise is worth
nothing, if there isn't an outcry among you, when huge fleets of
ships take everything out of the oceans unregulated, undocumented
and illegally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kids for Forests youth delegation consists of around 30
young people between 13 and 20 years of age, coming from 13
countries around the world: from Australia/Pacific, Austria,
Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia,
Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Two to three young people from
each country are invited, accompanied by one Greenpeace
chaperon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clara ended her speech with a promise of action: "We are doing
our part. Now, it's your responsibility to set the course for a
global network of protected areas. And let the people affected,
especially indigenous people like Omanie, take part in the
decisions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Worth Fighting for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forest Project" title="Kids for Forest Project" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56758"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Kids
for Forests and Greenpeace are fighting for protected areas at the
CBD in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Protected areas are the backbone of
conserving life on Earth. It is widely agreed that, if we want to
halt that loss of countless plants and animals that are threatened
with extinction, we need an effective system of protected areas in
every country and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBD commits each nation to establish such a system. But this
goal has not been met: the system of protected areas is not
comprehensive, it does not represent enough of nature's biological
diversity and it is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want the governments to adopt a strong programme of work on
protected areas with strict targets, specific timelines and clearly
identified responsibilities. We want them to tell us who (which
country, which political institution) is doing what, by when, and
how they plan to establish a global network of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the demands of future generations, of children who
don't see the words "biodiversity" on a piece of paper but the
lives of the orang-utans, forest deer, monkeys, gorillas, and birds
that share their world -- and whose homes are threatened in exact
proportion to the threat to our own future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Who are we? Young people who want to change the world! What do we want? Renewable Energy! Make no mistake - the world is heading for climate disaster if we don't change our dirty energy ways soon. The young people of the Solar Generation project don't want to be living in a disaster of our making. They are campaigning now for the switch to clean renewable energy across the globe.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            15,000 postcards from the public calling for renewable energy are delivered in a ball of ice to the Bonn Renewables conference. While there was some progress at the conference it still left much to do to tackle global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people have the most to lose from global warming but also
the most to gain from the urgent action that is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts. Right now young people from around the
world are coming together under the Solar Generation banner to end
the inaction that brings global warming disasters closer and
closer. Henry is from China, where clean energy is a must for the
huge population. Abigail, from the Philippines, comes from a
community fighting a dirty coal power station on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now members of Solar Generation are facing possibly their
biggest challenge. Many of them are in Bonn, Germany for a major
political conference on renewable energy. Their challenge is to
bring the reality of global warming to politicians cosseted in
stuffy, plush conference rooms and help ensure the conference will
amount to more than just nice words about renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Abigail addressing renewables conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60915"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;They
made a start with the chance to make a speech to the first day of
the conference. Abigail addressed the delegates along with Henry
from China and Lisa from Germany:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With what we are experiencing, we, the members of Solar
Generation are putting our feet forward against climate change and
are pushing for renewable energy. Members from different countries
lobby to politicians, organize rallies and camps to increase public
awareness, participate in direct actions and support each other in
raising funds for renewable energy installations. We, the Solar
Generation, are doing what we can. Now is your duty to do what you
can!"(Read the &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/index.php/pages/DisplayPage?id=147"&gt;
full speech&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in China, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.hk/africa/News/Multimedia/photos/israeli-marine-forces-board-th/?campaign_id=32"&gt;
Henry&lt;/a&gt; has been busy with Solar Campus projects to spread the
word on renewable energy to students and lobbying Chinese energy
companies to invest in renewable power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that our actions and passion for our environment
could make waves in our world! We will spread our concerns on
climate change and take action to change the behaviour of power
companies, government and our universities, with the support and
spirit of more and more energetic youths!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if today's political masters rise to the
challenge of tomorrow's Solar Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Solar Generation in the following countries: &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.fr/solargeneration/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jugendsolarprojekt.ch/"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergynow.org/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Finland resumes its destruction of old-growth forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/finland-forests/</url><text>
	Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland.  The vast majority of Finland's valuable old-growth is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus.  Metsähallitus' logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value - including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/10/september-2003-logging-in-sa.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            September, 2003, logging in Sami area
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being involved in a 'dialogue' process with two environmental organisations (WWF and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too - friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there's a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland's three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on customers of Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will entering their supply chain, pending comprehensive agreement on additional protection for these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin to switch all virgin fibre in their supply chain to sources that have been independently certified, at least to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Food companies go GE-Free in China</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/food-companies-go-ge-free-in-c/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;GE rejection gathers pace in world's largest food market&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In China, the world's largest food market, 32 food companies, producing 53 brands have agreed not to sell genetically engineered (GE) food. Although non-GE policy is already standard in many countries worldwide, this is the first time food producers have publicly committed to such a policy in China.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/7/chinese-consumers-turn-their-b.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese consumers turn their backs on GE food. Greenpeace Food Safety Roadshow visit to Huaying green community in Guangzhou.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, consumers around the world do not want GE
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food companies in China are joining the ranks of a growing
number of non-GE companies worldwide. This is another blow to the
GE industry, which is already troubled by increasing market
rejection and is desperate to find new markets to dump its unwanted
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some well known brand names appear amongst the 32 food producers
promising not to use GE ingredients in products sold in China
including Lipton, Wrigley, Wyeth and Mead Johnson. These companies
have already been selling non-GE food in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sze Pang-cheung said "Transnational food
companies are learning the lesson. There is a heavy price to pay
for applying double standards to Chinese consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we revealed Nestle´s ruthless overseas practice of selling
GE food, including baby food, in China and other Asian countries,
the Swiss-based company´s "double standards" met with angry
reactions from Chinese consumers who returned products to
Nestle.&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=7624&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;&lt;br&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GE is unmistakably the growing trend in China. The majority
of consumers do not want GE foods, and the Chinese government is
taking consumer's rights to choose seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released China's first comprehensive survey of consumer
attitude to GE food in January this year. The survey showed that a
clear majority would choose GE-free food over GE food and many
would be willing to pay more for it. An overwhelming majority of 87

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, the Chinese government introduced compulsory
labelling of GE food. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/news/details?item_id=15856&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has stepped up measures to enforce the labelling
legislation by conducting a nationwide inspection. Agriculture
officials emphasised that producers selling unlabelled GE products
would be penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The choice for food producers is either to label their GE
products and face consumer rejection, or to risk violating the
regulation by covering up the true nature of their products," added
Sze. "Companies simply have to make the right decision for
consumers, the environment and their business interests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge more companies to follow suit to address consumers'
growing concerns about GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnaud Immele (Oenologist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

	A climate tipping point is looming closer every day in the Arctic. The more we find out about the Polar Regions, the more we realise that what we know about the impact of feedback effects has been underestimated. Recent discoveries highlight the need for action now, before it’s too late. 
&lt;div&gt;

            The settlement of Tasilaq in Greenland where the Arctic Sunrise stopped to re-supply.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subtropical currents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of independent scientists on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is investigating whether warming subtropical ocean currents are causing Greenland glaciers to melt faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the melt from warming temperatures is a known phenomenon, the influence of currents is less understood, and new research conducted by Dr Fiamma Straneo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution is groundbreaking.  (Or, perhaps, "icebreaking"?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over the last decade we've seen dramatic changes in the Greenland ice sheet; in particular there's been a large loss of mass of ice from Greenland's outlet glaciers. One of the mechanisms we think may have triggered these changes is the inflow of warm subtropical water inside of Greenland's glacial fjords," Dr Straneo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A (frozen) river runs through it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These currents could be causing the dramatic melt of Greenlandic glaciers. Dr Gordon Hamilton, of the University of Maine, has been studying the speed of flow of the Greenland glaciers, and in particular Helheim glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are like frozen rivers, with ice slowly moving downstream at an average of 50 meters per year. Helheim glacier is moving at the speed of 25 meters per DAY. Located further North, the Kangerdlugssuaq glacier moves at an average of &lt;em&gt;38 meters per day&lt;/em&gt;. This is opening the way for the Greenland ice sheet to flow out, melt in the Atlantic Ocean, and contribute to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is probably the world's fastest moving glacier. It tripled its speed between 2004 and 2005, which tells us the glacier is moving mass out of the middle of Greenland's ice sheet, in the form of icebergs, at a rate three times faster than just a few years ago. This has important implications for both the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the rate of global sea level rise," said Dr Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating feedback effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other feedback effects in the Arctic are highlighted in a new &lt;a href="http://panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/news/?173241/Warming-Arctics-global-impacts-outstrip-predictions"&gt; WWF report&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that  their influence on the global climate also may have been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic multi-year sea ice is increasingly replaced by younger sea ice, making the ice-cap more vulnerable to melting in the summer. This allows the surface water to absorb more heat. The permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is heating up as well, releasing underground methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This methane then further contributes to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report also points out that the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2007 estimates on sea-level rise were too optimistic, and offers new estimates of up to 1.2 meters by the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the IPCC reported an &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter5.pdf"&gt; estimated sea-level rise of 20 to 50 cm&lt;/a&gt;. As worrying as these figures were, evidence now suggest things are worse than they'd thought. The effect that the melting Greenland ice-sheet could have on sea-level rise was not fully included in the IPCC reports, since these findings are too recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we go beyond the tipping point where global warming feeds itself, there will be no going back. The time for action is now. In 95 days, the Copenhagen climate Conference will start. World leaders have to show their commitment to the climate by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;attending and adopting strong emissions targets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell global leaders to go to Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

            Elephants take Thai Buddhist monks to bless the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

The Chang(e) Caravan&lt;/a&gt;, led by elephants rehabilitated by the
Thai Elephant Research and Conservation Fund (TERF), is a &lt;a href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;TckTckTck&lt;/a&gt; initiative. Tck Tck Tck
involves a growing number of organisations mobilising civil society
and galvanising public opinion in support of profound change and
rapid action to save the planet from the devastation effects of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 15-day journey, a people's caravan for change, will traverse
the vast Central Plains of Thailand, from Khao Yai National Park to
the outskirts of Bangkok. The city is the venue of a crucial UNFCCC
(United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change) meeting
ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands. Ask them to go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work.

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose
risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;Ask governments worldwide to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting GE Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments.

            Mama Sarah Obama flicks on the lights  after a Solar power system was installed at her home in Kogelo Village, Kenya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a title="Solargen" href="/international/en/news/features/the-solar-generation/"&gt;Solar Generation&lt;/a&gt; Activists and local youth organisers installed the panels on "Mama Sara's" home, and also put panels on the Senator Barack Obama School in Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar installations are part of a 20 day renewable energy workshop hosted by Solar Generation with 25 participants from the Kibera Community Youth Programme and community members of Nyang'oma Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program helps young Kenyans learn how solar photovoltaic panels generate electricity, about their installation and maintenance and the fabrication of self-assembling solar lamps and their marketing potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what Mama Sarah had to say about the new solar panels on her house: "I am very pleased that my home has been improved thanks to solar energy and I'll make sure my grandson hears about it. Solar power is clean, reliable and affordable, unlike paraffin that is widely used in the area. Also, we now have qualified youth in the village who can help with the upkeep of the systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climate impacts reach Kenya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya, like many other countries in Africa, is on the climate impacts frontline. It has seen a drastic reduction in rainfall in recent years. Drought is amplifying problems in agriculture caused by poor land use and desertification, making Kenya's large scale hydro power unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, investing in solar energy technologies is a win-win strategy. It strengthens the economy and protects the environment, while ensuring a reliable and clean energy supply. The solar industry is ready and able to deliver the needed capacity. There is no technical impediment to doing this, just a political barrier to overcome as we rebuild the global energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes you can too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 108 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Tell President Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and take personal responsibility for their government’s response to climate change and to attend the United Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We couldn't afford to make projects like this happen without your support. Please give what you can so that we can continue to promote clean energy projects.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Leather industry giant moves to end Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bertin140809/</url><text>
	Bertin, the world’s largest leather exporter is joining the fight against deforestation and climate change and is finally doing the right thing and backing the call for a moratorium on buying cattle from farms responsible for Amazon deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is currently the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/" target="_blank"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon'&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies Adidas, &lt;a title="Nike victory" href="/international/en/news/features/nike-amazon230709/"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Timberland, Clarks, Geox and Timberland have all committed not to buy leather from Amazon destruction, prompting the recent decision by Bertin to commit to stop sourcing cattle from newly deforested areas and implement a traceability system to ensure the sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, Bertin will register and map all farms which directly supply cattle to the company. For the rest of the supply chain, including rearing and nursery farms, it will implement a traceability system from farms to its slaughterhouses and processing facilities by 2011. They will also ensure that they don't buy cattle from indigenous and protected areas or from farms linked to slave labour, land conflicts and land grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertin's commitment to end Amazon deforestation comes soon after a similar announcement from Marfrig, one of the world's largest beef traders. It leaves Brazilian JBS-Friboi, the world's largest producer and global exporter of processed beef as the last major exporter that has failed to commit to help end the destruction of the Amazon.  Contrary to its competitors, JBS-Friboi is staying silent on the issue and is actually expanding into the Amazon, having rented several new facilities north of Mato Grosso State, an area which has the greatest rate of cattle ranching expansion and deforestation in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's cattle sector needs to follow the soya industry's example and commit to a moratorium. Both the federal and state governments have to ensure a moratorium is effective by mapping, registering and monitoring rural properties and helping the private sector fulfill its corporate responsibilities. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction and contributes to making Brazil the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 114 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil has measures in place to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders, at this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, to agree on the funding required to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

	This week we have created a granite shield against bottom trawling in a fragile and ecologically important marine area in Sweden. Our activists sailed into Swedish waters and have so far placed 140 granite rocks (each weighing between 0.5 and 3 tonnes) in the Lilla Middelgrund in the Kattegat. Our intention is to move to nearby Fladen and do the same thing there.
&lt;div&gt;

            “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.” -- Ryunosuke Satoro
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These regions, boasting unique and rich marine life, have been protected on paper by the EU and the Swedish government since 2003 (&lt;a id="a6wi" title="Natura 2000" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm"&gt;Natura 2000&lt;/a&gt;) yet lack any mechanisms to actually stop fishing and other damaging activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8194105.stm" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the video on BBC news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a specially equipped barge, our team is placing a number of large boulders on the seafloor to act as obstacles stopping fishermen from ploughing up the rare habitats of &lt;a id="bixa" title="maerl beds" href="http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk/communities/maerl/m3_1.htm"&gt;maerl beds&lt;/a&gt; and bubble reefs. Bubble reefs (underwater structures created by gasseepage) are amazing habitats of great scientific interest that have only recently been discovered in Sweden. But despite the existence of these vulnerable habitats, bottom trawling, one of most destructive forms of fishing, is common throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real protection needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawlers drag a net across the sea bed, indiscriminately catching everything in its path. This decimates stocks of popular fish, such assole and plaice, and results in a large amount of unwanted bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or dying. It also destroys any living structures that have grown on the sea bed - often acting as a sanctuary for an abundance of other life forms. Without apermanent ban on fishing in this area - there is no hope for the preservation of a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, marine protection exists only on paper. But our seas cannot wait any longer, their survival is at stake and politicians need to take action and implement laws that will protect the life of the seas today and for the future. However, under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) countries do not have the powers to regulate or prohibit fisheries. EU fisheries law states that such decisions have to be taken at an EU-level. This Catch-22 situation needs to be addressed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, we placed 320 boulders in Germany's Sylt Outer Reef, another "protected" site, which was being destroyed by bottom trawling. In doing so, trawlers have been prevented from fishing on the reef and the boulders have already being colonised by a wealth of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long-term solution, we are calling on the Swedish EU-presidency to reform the CFP, enabling responsible authorities in member states to take necessary conservation measures in all types of marine protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fisherman's friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides showing up with some large stones - our team in Sweden has planned and prepared this work for months. An important step was the preparation of an environmental impact assessment to ensure that the activity would not be damaging to the environment. &lt;a href="http://eiastones.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;We also invited anyone interested - fishermen, politicians and all - to comment on our plans&lt;/a&gt;. The scientific impact assessment concluded that the strategic placement of stones would not negatively impact the marine environment, and the responsible authority shared this view and informed us that we would not need a permit. Fishermen from nearby Varberg also recognised theimportance of our proposal. As one fisherman said: "We shall and we must protect the shallow banks and the refuges that exist there. Then perhaps we can even get the wolf fish back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/greenpeace-activists-strategic.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to defend our oceans from the effects of over-fishing around the world, we are campaigning for a global networkof large fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of our oceans, including the North and Baltic seas. Supported by scientists - these reserves will restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse. Marine reserves also make our oceans more resilient to the ravages of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call now for a global network of marine reserves - protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title> Activists block Australian coal as leaders abandon the Pacific</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/australia-coal-pacific060809/</url><text>
	As activists continue a two day blockade of a coal export terminal in Queensland, Australia, the outcome of the Pacific Islands Forum in nearby Cairns has left Pacific Islanders to fend for themselves against the increasingly devastating effects of climate change - because it's clear their rich neighbours are unlikely to help them. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the single biggest climate criminal
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal blocking activists from countries including New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Australia and the Cook Islands have been demanding that Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd (Australia) and John Key (New Zealand) stop putting the interests of big polluters over the future and the very survival of Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island leaders this week called for strong emissions reductiontargets of 45 percent by 2020 for developed countries and an ambitious global climate treaty aiming to limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5 °C. On Tuesday, the Small Island States leaders reiterated these demands at a press conference. But just two days later, not only have those demands vanished from the final communiqué, but the 2020 targets have also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of seeing an agreement on emissions cuts to fight climate change, the PacificIslands have received only promises to build higher sea walls against the rising tides caused by, amongst other things, Australian coal exports. This is yet another setback to the already shambolic negotiations process in the leadup to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter where this coal is burned, carbon pollution has no borders. Our homes are being devastated by climate change and we need genuine support from our Australian neighbours, not make-believe emissions cuts and empty &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;gestures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam, activist from Papua New Guinea speaking as he blocked the Abbot Point coal export&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal or climate Kevin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftering our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/blog/energy/?p=728"&gt;activists spent 36 hours hanging off the Hay Point coal port&lt;/a&gt;, we sent our ship, Esperanza, to continue blocking the terminal. We have run three days of coal actions, including the complete shut down of the Abbot Point coal export terminal, to highlight the injustice of Australia and New Zealand abandoning their Pacific neighbours while throwing tax payer dollars at dying fossil fueled industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal exports to rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbot Point coal export terminal is set to double in size, financed by more than AUS$328 million (198 million euros) of public money in 2009/10. This will add an extra 67.5 million tonnes of carbon pollution a year - equal to the annual carbon footprint of 2.4 million Australians. And even though the Hay Point coal export terminal is already one of the biggest in the world, it is now being expanded from 112 to 190 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total capacity of Australia's coal exports will more than double from 332 to 730 millions tonnes per year. This expansion is a snub for the Pacific, and an economic and environmental disaster for Australia. By reinforcing Australia's position as the world's largest carbon dealer, Kevin Rudd continues to shun both his neighbours and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling short of weak targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear here: a global temperature rise of 2°C would still cause climate chaos in the Pacific. And if the world adopted the policies Kevin Rudd is implementing there is little chance of limiting temperature rise even to 2°C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24990/australia-coal-block3.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Key is expected to announce New Zealand's 2020 targets on Monday, but they are likely to also fall way short of the at least 40 percent by 2020 required - a target set by the climate scientists and &lt;a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/"&gt;demanded by nearly 90,000 New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that temperature rise must peak as far below two degrees as possible, and to get back to much safer levels after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see more than 12 coal ships waiting to load coal behind me. There are mountains of coal. It is a bit overwhelming - tonnes and tonnes of it. Everything I see here means to me that there's one more family that will be affected, one more child that won't have the future they &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;deserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza, which continues to block the Hay Point coal terminal, has just finished a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/07/pacific_voices_on_climate_chan.html"&gt; tour of several Pacific islands where the crew witnessed the impacts of climate change there first hand&lt;/a&gt;. They spoke to many Pacific people who are forced to deal with the changing environment on a daily basis. Now, in Australia - we're continuing to support the urgent Pacific call for world leaders to act now: to take personal responsibility for tackling climate change and guaranteeing a good deal for the climate in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join the call for world leaders to personally attend the UN Climate Summit this December in Copenhagen - and ensure a good deal for the Pacific and the rest of the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It is finally time to celebrate a major victory for the Boreal Forest! Kimberly-Clark has, as a result of public pressure, released a new environmental fibre policy that governs how it will help conserve forests and support sustainable forestry and use more recycled fibre.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/boreal001.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Boreal forest is the largest intact forest ecosystem in North America. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;our campaign&lt;/a&gt; has been supported by tens of thousands of activists and hundreds of companies, to demand that Kimberly-Clark (K-C) stop destroying ancient forests like the Boreal Forest. In this tremendous victory for ancient forests,  the company that is known for its popular brands like Kleenex, Scott, and Cottonelle has announced &lt;a title="KC policy" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/KC"&gt;a policy&lt;/a&gt; that places it among the industry leaders in sustainability. This announcement brings the &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Kleercut campaign&lt;/a&gt; to a successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we can expect from the new policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark has set a goal of obtaining 100 percent of the wood fibre used in its products - including the flagship brand Kleenex - from environmentally responsible sources. By 2011, Kimberly-Clark will ensure that 40 percent of its North American fiber is either recycled or certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) - a 71 percent increase from 2007 levels, representing over 600,000 tonnes of fibre. Also by 2011, it will eliminate any fiber from the North American Boreal Forest that is not FSC®-certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of K-C's place in the paper products market, the company's new policy will send a strong signal to its competitors, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, SCA, and Georgia Pacific, that creating a policy that protects ancient forests is a key element of sustainable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;K-C's sustainability policy: Not just about protecting the Boreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Boreal Forest is North America's largest ancient forest and provides habitat to threatened species such as woodland caribou, bald and golden eagles, wolverine and more than one billion birds, many of them migratory. Sadly, more than 60 percent of the Boreal has already been allocated to forestry companies for development and less than 10 percent of the Boreal Forest is formally protected. Unfortunately, in provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, much of the commercial forest has already been fragmented and degraded by clearcuts and logging roads...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clear-cutting in forests doesn't just wipe out biodiversity - it wipes out an essential carbon storehouse. The Boreal Forest is the world's largest storehouse of terrestrial carbon. The Canadian Boreal stores an estimated 186 billion tonnes of carbon, or more than 27 years worth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting and managing the forest responsibly is essential for fighting climate change. Intact forests, particularly ones extending over thousands of square kilometres, better mitigate the impacts of climate change. The fight to protect the Boreal and forests globally is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need world leaders to agree on the funding required to end deforestation at this years Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations so please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Parody of Esso logo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our "Don't buy Esso, Don't buy Exxon/Mobil" campaign,
we developed a parody of Esso's logo with a double dollar sign:
E$$O. (Esso is the name under which Exxon/Mobil trades in many
parts of the world outside North America)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso took us to court for copyright infringement, claiming our
Stop Esso website would "confuse customers" into thinking they were
at a real Esso site. Hmmm. Esso customers must be a particularly
dim lot. Would you be confused by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that wasn't enough, Esso also made the feeble attempt to
claim that the logo made them look like Nazis, given a similarity
only they could see between two dollar signs together and the
stylized Nazi SS symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" title="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52918"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
the real belly laugh came when Esso claimed that our abuse of their
logo would damage their "good reputation." This is the company that
has done more than any other corporation to undermine the science
and policy debate on global warming. This is the company that
donated massively to George Bush's election campaign, and was
rewarded with the US withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol. This is
the company that despoiled the pristine Alaskan coastline with an
oil spill the effects of which are still with us today. This is the
company responsible for &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040128/energy_exxon_climate_1.html"&gt;5
percent of all greenhouse gasses&lt;/a&gt; on the planet. This is the
company which has been branded environmental criminal #1 and been
targeted by activists all over the world in a massive "Don't Buy
Esso" campaign. If Esso was really worried about its reputation, it
might try doing something for our planet and our children's future
instead of using its gargantuan legal resources to try and stamp
out the wildfire of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court ruled our parody of the Esso logo was within
acceptable limits of freedom of expression, rejecting Esso's claims
of tradmark infringement. Greenpeace has been campaigning against
the oil giant since 2001 when US President George Bush pulled the
US out of the international negotiations to tackle climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso has spent millions in its fight to stop the world's
government's tackling climate change, and was behind Bush pulling
out of the Kyoto Protocol. Esso obviously thought this case would
be an easy win but it was wrong. Today's ruling is a victory in the
fight to protect the climate against a company that will go to any
means to silence its critics," said Greenpeace campaigner, Anita
Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with us. Next time you pass an Esso or Exxon station,
put your thumb to your nose, wiggle your fingers, and say:
Naaa-naaa-naaa-naaa-naaaaa, Don't buy E$$O!&lt;/p&gt;

	Since the French power authority has refused to build wind farms, we built our own this morning on the grounds of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France. We put ten wind turbines up to protest the French government decision to build another nuclear reactor on the site, despite a large nuclear energy overcapacity and the far more environmentally and economically sane option of investing in wind energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/12/greenpeace-activists-display-1.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists display 10 model wind turbines on the premises of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France in protest at the French government's decision to build another reactor on the site.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franc for franc, wind is the better investment. As detailed in a
report published today, "Wind vs Nuclear 2003" the same money spent
on wind power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more
electricity than a nuclear reactor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of the proposed French reactor is officially estimated
at some 3-3.5 billion Euros. If this amount of money were invested
in wind power, some 7616 megawatts of wind capacity could be built,
compared to 1550 TWh in the nuclear case. Wind would generate a
massive 24 TWh per year, the equivalent of 6.5 million households.
Nuclear would only deliver 10 terrawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years wind power has gone from the hippy fringe to
economic viability. In Germany, over 3,200 megawatts of wind power
were installed in the last year alone, supplying electricity to
more than 2 million households. In the EU, a massive 75,000
megawatts of wind capacity is expected to be online by 2010,
tripling the current power and adding the equivalent electricity
production of 14 large nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this worries the nuclear industry, especially given
the current decline in nukes: no single reactor has been connected
to the grid in the last four years, and it would take at least
another 10 years before a new reactor could come online. A growing
number of old reactors have reached the end of their life
expectancies and should be shut down. In reality, wind has already
taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is urging state owned EdF, Electricity de France,
not to impose yet another dangerous and uneconomic nuclear reactor
on Europe. The EPR [European Pressurized Reactor] is nothing new,
it is an outdated and unsafe design, to be fuelled by plutonium and
will produce extremely radioactive waste," said our campaigner on
site, Jan Vande Putte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europe is at a crossroad and we refuse to let the nuclear lobby
dictate our energy future regardless of the opinion, the
environment and the security of people. Greenpeace asks EDF to make

	Our marathon action in Chioggia, Italy came to an end last night after three days of protest when Italian police intervened to end our blockade of the Panama-registered bulk carrier, Keoyang Majesty, which is carrying 40,000 thousands tons of Argentine Genetically Engineered (GE) Soya.

            Greenpeace canoeist  arrested by the Guadia di Finanza during an action to prevent the offloading of 40,000 tonnes of Argentian GE Soya from the bulk carrier Keoyang Majesty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the determination of 18 activists from our ship, the
Esperanza, this action has been going on since Sunday morning, when
they first boarded the Keoyang Majesty displaying banners saying
'Don't Buy GE Food' and 'Defend Yourself from GMOs'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night they left the GE ship for safety reasons, this
morning the focus changed to preventing the trans-shipment system,
used to offload the cargo from the ship onto small barges, actually
reaching the ship. Two activists boarded one of the barges, ten
activists climbed onto the elevator used to take the GE soya out of
the GE ship and six activists were in canoes between the barge and
the Keoyang Majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the blockade the Italian Ministry of Health has
committed itself to carry out an inspection of the GE Soya now
being unloaded from the Keoyang Majesty in order to check whether
the GE cargo complies with EU legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Pagnan, the company importing the GE soya meal, has
stated to our campaigners in Italy that it will provide us with the
list of the buyers for its cargo of soymeal. We will of course be
taking this issue up with these companies and put pressure on them
to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Greenpeace activists take Soya Samples to verify that the Keoyang Majesty from Argentina is transporting GE soya meal" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="59853"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Keoyang Majesty from Argentina is transporting GE soya meal
for, among others, the multinational companies Bunge and Cargill,
to be used for animal feed. Italy imports 4.2 million tons of soya
annually for food and animal feed of which over 3 million tons are
estimated to be GE or GE contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto our GE campaigner from Argentina, who is on
board the Esperanza said: "Argentina is determined to produce GE
soya to feed pigs, cows and chickens in the developed world. Almost
its entire production of soya is GE. What remains of the native
forest lands are being converted for GE soya production, it is time
to stop this environmental and social nightmare in Argentina."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today informed the French government at a hearing that we will not remove information concerning nuclear waste transports from our websites.  This defies an order from the French Ministry of Industry to treat all information regarding nuclear materials in France and their transport as state secrets.  As a consequence, Greenpeace France and its staff may be facing jail and fines for informing the public about dangerous plutonium shipments.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists protesting nuclear power at Cattenom.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An order issued on August 9th in Paris declared all information
regarding the protection of nuclear materials, including
transports, classified for national security purposes. Greenpeace
is opposed to the production, transport and use of plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the transportation of plutonium, released in defiance
of the new decree, will be presented by Greenpeace at a "Special
Commission" that will hold a meeting on nuclear affairs today.
Politicians, Government officials and representatives of Cogema,
the state reprocessing company in Cherbourg, will attend this
meeting. The head of nuclear security within the French Government,
M. Lallemand, responsible for issuing the new security decree, is
also scheduled to testify at the Special Commission hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February this year Greenpeace blocked a nuclear transport
containing 150 kilogram of pure plutonium in the city center of
Chalon-sur-Saone, while en route from la Hague, Normandy to
Marcoule, in Provence. Cogema, the state nuclear reprocessing
company, conducts as many as 2-3 transports every week from its
reprocessing complex at la Hague to its plutonium fuel production
plant at Marcoule. Each transport carries enough plutonium for 30
nuclear weapons. In May, after Cogema resumed transports,
Greenpeace launched a 'citizens inspection' website containing
information on plutonium transports observed by volunteers and
activists along the 1000 kilometre route: &lt;a href="http://www.stop-plutonium.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stop-plutonium.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Putting us in jail to keep us quiet will not remove the
danger." said Yannick Rousselet. "Nuclear fuel shipments are
dangerous to the communities they move through, they are potential
terrorist targets, and they should be stopped rather than covered
up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the order flies in the face of nuclear industry
company Areva's policy of "maximum openness" regarding nuclear
transports. Under the new order, much of what Areva publishes on
their website and releases to the public would be classified
illegal. But according to an Areva spokesperson quoted in Le Monde,
the nuclear industry, which claims it was not consulted on the new
law, was told "we didn't need to change anything in our
communication policy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Opposing nuclear transports in France." title="Opposing nuclear transports in France." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47188"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
target of the order is Greenpeace, which has exposed the threat
from land and sea transports of nuclear fuel and waste in France
and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear materials travel a cumulative distance of 250,000
kilometres each year in France. One plutonium transport contains
sufficient material for 30 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. One cask
full of highly radioactive spent fuel elements contains
approximately as much radiation as was released by the Chernobyl
disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry claims that the casks are safe because they
have to undergo crash tests. In fact, they are tested to maintain
integrity when dropped 9 metres onto a hard rigid surface, or
dropped 1 metre onto a metal bar. They are tested to survive a 30
minute hydrocarbon fire at 800 °C. And they are cited as safe for
immersion to a depth of 15 metres of water for 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet according to French accident statistics for hazardous
materials, the casks would not withstand 1 accident in 20 involving
impact, and 50% of accidents involving fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transports could also be targets for terrorist attacks or theft:
Pierre Robert, a Frenchman jailed for life in Morroco for
terrorism, claimed to know of Al-Quaeda plans to attack a Cogema
plutonium transport. Greenpeace and WISE, in a report published in
February of this year, estimated that if such an attack were
carried out with heavy artillery near Lyon, it would impact 125,000
people, cause 500 fatal cancers and require the evacuation of part
of the city of Lyon and its outlying suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Stop Plutonium" title="Stop Plutonium" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47173"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Transports
are carried out without prior notification or consent of the
communities or countries along the transport routes. Last year
Greenpeace tracked and highlighted the dangers of a British
plutonium fuel transport from Japan to the UK. Over 80 Governments
condemned the transport based upon information provided by the
environmental organization along the 30,000 kilometre route through
the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French government's move to silence Greenpeace is consistent
with a larger move worldwide toward greater government secrecy in
the name of security. The nuclear industry in particular is taking
advantage of public fears of terrorist attack to become less
transparent and to silence dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, hundreds of thousands of public documents
were removed from government Web sites following the September 11th
attacks, including Environmental Protection Agency reports on the
consequences of industrial accidents. U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft's Justice Department told U.S. agencies to be more
cautious about releasing records and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If governments are serious about reducing the threat of nuclear
materials," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International "then the
only thing to do is end nuclear power. Increased secrecy
conveniently serves the nuclear industry's agenda of diminished
scrutiny. That means greater risks to an uninformed public, and
less public opposition. Plutonium and nuclear energy are not
compatible with democracy and have no place in our global
society."&lt;/p&gt;

	Spain is the only country in the European Union that tolerates the release of genetically engineered (GM) crops on a commercial scale. Though only cultivated on relatively small areas, the potential impact of Syngenta's GE maize on environment, agriculture and health and the total lack of information and precaution are of serious concern.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New report from Greenpeace slams the genetic experiment on maize in Spain
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GM maize (corn) contains a genetic construct called Bt 176,
consisting of a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis
that encodes an insecticidal toxin able to kill the European Corn
Borer. It also has a gene that confers increased tolerance to a
herbicide and a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic
ampicillin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngenta's (formerly Novartis) Bt176 corn was first grown in the
USA in 1996. The European Commission approved the placing on the
market of the GE crop in 1997, with a decision that was ignoring
the negative recommendations of the EU's own scientific committee
and the Environment Ministers Council. Several EU member states,
among them Austria, Luxembourg and Germany, prohibited the growing
of Bt176 maize due to concerns over detrimental environmental and
health effects. The Spanish authorities, however, approved the
commercial growing in 1998. While they are still on sale in Spain
today, the Bt176 varieties were already withdrawn in 2001 from the
list of approved varieties in the USA, a country known for its
support for GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52690"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
Spanish government not only ignored concerns over environmental and
human health risks, but also the fact that a majority of Spanish
consumers, as consumers in many other countries around the world,
say 'no' to GE foods and prefer non-GE products, even if the
genetically modified foods were much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report, "The impact of GM corn in Spain," has been
prepared by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. It reveals the
scandalous sloppiness around the planting of Syngenta's genetically
engineered maize in Spain. While the Spanish administration acted
irresponsibly in largely passing on responsibility for safety
standards to the GE company, Syngenta failed to meet even the lax
requirements that the government did impose. Five years after the
approval of the GE crop, the monitoring / prevention plan has still
not been made public. No official data is available on the exact
area planted with GE crops or on where they are planted; nor is
there an independent analysis of GE crop results in agronomic
terms, of the possible appearance of resistance in pest, of the
unwanted impacts on non-target species and soil ecosystem, or of
the effects of antibiotic resistance genes on animals and
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been proven that the GE varieties cultivated in Spain
give better results than conventional ones and are necessary and
useful for pest control. The low incidence of the corn-borer pest
in Spain does not justify taking the high risk of introducing Bt
maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52687"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
the meantime, the first cases of GE contamination have already
occurred in Spain. In 2001, organically grown maize in the Navarra
region was contaminated by Bt176 maize and, as a consequence,
farmers suffered losses since the crop couldn't be marketed as
organic produce. This illustrates how the 'polluter-pays' principle
is turned into a 'contaminated-farmer-pays' principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-author Juan-Felipe Carrasco of Greenpeace Spain said: "Spain
has become a big experimental field, where GE crops have been
cultivated for the last 5 years without any agronomic advantage
compared to conventional varieties and where no measures have been
adopted to prevent their negative impacts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish situation highlights the need for measures to
prevent the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;genetic contamination of conventional and organic crops and
should serve as a warning for the other European countries. No new
authorisation for growing of GM plants should be granted and, most
urgently, Member States should oppose the plans of the European
Commission to legalise the contamination of seeds by setting up
thresholds of authorised GE contamination in conventional seed
lots. Allowing contaminated seeds to be put on the market would
lead to a creeping and unmonitorable contamination of all European
farmlands by GMOs that would make it impossible to sustain a
GE-free supply after a few years. GE companies should instead be
made legally and financially liable for the environmental and
economic damages their products can cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing genetic contamination and other negative effects of
GE crops should now be the number one priority for the Spanish
Government instead of actively promoting GE agriculture in Spain.
We call on Spain to apply the precautionary principle and to stop
the growing of GE crops. The Spanish example should be a warning
signal to other European countries not to allow GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Tricks of the trade</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tricks-of-the-trade/</url><text>
	The ship breaking industry provides one of the clearest examples of exploiting the environment and workers for profit. But thanks to the exposure of this toxic trade and public pressure, the industry is slowly realising it must clean up its act. Help us maintain the pressure.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/10/workers-at-alang-shipbreaking-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/10/workers-at-alang-shipbreaking-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Workers at Alang shipbreaking yard.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ship reaches the end of its life it needs to be disposed
of. For something which maybe several stories high, hundreds of
metres long and full of various hazardous chemicals and explosive
fuel/gases, this is not an easy job. Most shipping companies take
the profitable option of selling the ships to scrap yards in Asia
where ships are broken up on beaches by workers using their bare
hands or minimal equipment. Hence the shipping company makes some
easy money and dumps the pollution from the ship in the developing
countries of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some irresponsible shipping companies want to spread this toxic
trade to Africa. The beautiful Bolama beach in the west African
country of Guinea Bissau may soon be turned into a scrap yard for
old toxic ships, threatening nature and the lives of local people.
The beach is part of the Bijagos Archipelagos, classified as a
Biosphere Reserve by United Nations (UNESCO). In May we started an
online action to save the Bolama beach. It has already achieved an
initial result: after receiving thousands of messages from
concerned people from all over the world, UNESCO has sent a
research mission to assess the situation. But continued pressure is
necessary to make sure that UNESCO takes effective measures to
protect Bolama Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=766&amp;amp;s=ship"&gt;Send a message now&lt;/a&gt; to stop the nature reserve being turned into a scrap yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Shipbreaking web game" border="0" align="left" item_id="50797"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
companies behind this plan are some of the bad guys in the murky
world of the shipping industry. To shine a light on the dirty
business of selling ships for shipbreaking, we have developed a
unique new web game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you know &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/shipgame/"&gt;'the tricks
of the trade'&lt;/a&gt;. You are the owner of the old ship "Rubbish
Queen" and you have to get rid of it. Can you make as much profit
as possible? Or do you care for the people and the environment? Try
to do better than most current ship owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the number of ships for scrap increases. It is
estimated that by 2010, 3000 ships per year will be scrapped. To
pressure the industry to reform we have put 50 ships heading for
scrap under the spotlight. We asked the owners to commit to
cleaning the toxic material from the ships before selling them for
scrapping. Recently the first company from the list,
American/Norwegian ship owner Stolt Nielsen, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news45.asp"&gt;committed
to prevent future pollution and health threats&lt;/a&gt; associated with
the breaking of ships. The company has a history of dumping
contaminated ships on Indian beaches. This company can prove that
ships can be disposed of without harming the environment and
endangering workers in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-on-toxic-patrol-in/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace sailing vessel the Rainbow Warrior is currently anchored off the coast of Alang, India. Alang is the site of the world's largest shipbreaking yard. Greenpeace is planning to conduct "toxic patrols" of ships which are here waiting for scrapping. A team of experts will do a survey and take samples to determine what type of toxic materials are on board before the ships are beached and the actual scrapping starts. Shipbreaking is an enormous danger for people and the environment. Greenpeace is the only organization in the world fighting for the 100,000 people working in this industry and for the environment they live in.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 14th of October the highest court in India decided that
the responsibility for clean scrap (shipbreaking) lies not just
with the shipbreakers, but also, and more importantly, with the
ship owners. This Court Order says that all ships must be
toxic-free before the scrapping actually begins. If the Greenpeace
"toxic patrols" show that ships arriving in India for scraping
still contain toxic substances, we will demand that the Indian
government enforce the Supreme Court Order and take action against
the owners of these ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also lobbying the Indian government to take a
strong position in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
with the other shipbreaking countries (Bangladesh, China, Pakistan
and Turkey). The IMO is the only party, within the United Nations,
which can make international rules for the ship owners. At the
moment they have only proposed voluntary guidelines for the
shipbreaking industry. Greenpeace believes that only a mandatory
international law can effectively regulate the ship owners. At this
stage there are many ruses that ship owners can use to subvert
these the rules and regulations. If India is the only country that
has strict regulations on shipbreaking then ship owners will go
elsewhere to find lax regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Scrap yard Alang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alang shipbreaking yards started scrapping ships in 1983 and
is now the world's biggest. Alang contains 184 plots which employ
40.000 workers. Current shipbreaking methods pose a serious danger
to both people and the environment. Most of the toxic waste ends up
in the ocean. The workers inhale toxic substances, such as
asbestos, 24 hours a day: at work and, because they live right next
to the yards, at home. They are not provided with any protective
clothing or safety equipment nor are they provided with any
training on how to deal with toxic materials. There are regular
accidents in the yards which often cause the deaths of many people.
In the past three months there have been 4 explosions in which 25
people died. On top of all this most workers are paid on average
US$1 per day and have no system of worker's medical insurance or
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What Greenpeace wants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is not against shipbreaking or the shipbreakers.
Greenpeace wants a mandatory international law requiring that all
ships must have an inventory of all toxic materials on board.
Locations of materials must be clear. A plan must be made to remove
all these toxic materials before the ship goes for scrap and before
the ship gets scrapped it must be made fuel-free to avoid future
explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Canadian harp seal hunt: largest ever</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/harp-seal-hunt/</url><text>
	The Canadian government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 350,000 animals this year. While "whitecoat" harp seals (under 2 weeks old) are still protected as a result of actions by Greenpeace and other organisations in the 70s and 80s, and some of the more extreme animal rights abuses have been outlawed, older seals can still be legally hunted under Canadian law.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace  activist sprays a seal with harmless dye to render its pelt worthless to commercial hunters in 1982.  An EU ban on killing harp seals under 2 weeks old put an end to the commercial hunt for whitecoats -- but not to the killing of older seals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's quota is the highest for any year since 1967.
Canada's cod fishery collapsed in the early 90s, and some in Canada
blamed the seals, despite the fact that the greatest culprit was
clearly decades of human overfishing. The collapse of fisheries
around Newfoundland due to mismanagement are a major driver in the
economics of expanding the seal hunt -- and part of an all too
predictable cycle of "exploit, deplete, and move on" which have
characterised human commercial hunts of wild animals the world
over. History has taught us that as soon as a market exists and
profits are to be made, the pressure to hunt a species beyond
sustainable population levels will inevitably lead to a
non-sustainable hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oppose any human activity harmful to populations of seals. We
oppose the killing of seals for commercial trade. We oppose taking
animals from endangered, threatened or seriously reduced
populations, from populations whose status is unknown or where it
is thought a hunt may have an adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add new uncertainties about how global warming is
impacting fragile arctic environments, an expanded hunt means the
impacts on seal populations are at best uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned
against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since
that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, and other organisations, have taken the lead in
campaigning against the slaughter of seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and other organisations taking action against the
commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take action with the &lt;a href="http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=21446" target="_blank"&gt;International Fund for Animal Welfare,&lt;/a&gt; where
you can sign the "&lt;a href="http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=85044" target="_blank"&gt;Million Signature Petition.&lt;/a&gt;" You can also &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1374&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;write to
the Canadian Prime Minister via our action centre.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
