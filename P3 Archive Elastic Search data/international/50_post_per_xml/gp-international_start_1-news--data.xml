	Like the flower it has been named after, a budding civil movement is emerging and taking root in Japan to protest against the government’s decision to restart the Ohi nuclear plant.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The restart, just 18 months after the devastating tsunami and resulting nuclear Fukushima nuclear disaster last year, has sparked indignation and alarm in a Japanese society left scarred by the catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a nation not especially known for public protests or civil disobedience, the rolling demonstrations in Japan this week and last suggest a major shift in Japanese society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/international/Global/international/photos/nuclear/2012/Japan-Nuclear.jpg" alt="Junichi Sato" width="300" height="200"&gt;This movement against nuclear energy has been named after the Hydrangea, a flower the Japanese have traditionally loved because it blooms in June and July, giving hope during the dark, rainy season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The symbolism of the flower is strikingly synonymous with the growing civil movement against nuclear power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born out of the aftermath of arguably one of Japan’s darkest hours, the movement offers hope and is gathering in numbers – similar to how the Hydrangea forms its flower; each small flower bunches together to form a bigger, more vibrant, flower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, stood with trembling excitement among tens of thousands of people shouting “Saikado Hantai” (No Restart of Nuclear Plant) in front of the gate of the prime minister’s office in Tokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protestors had emerged to object to a decision from Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to restart the first nuclear reactor following the 3/11 disaster.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heading up the stairs from the subway station towards the demonstration, I could already feel the powerful energy of the protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even mothers with small children, the future of Japan, were holding handmade banners saying “NO NUKES”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Held on a Friday night, city workers in suits left their offices to join the protest after work. They too were holding placards in a protest that is truly made up of diverse parts of Japanese society.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The last time I saw a crowd of people that came close to this was a march in 2003, when the Japanese people voiced their opposition to war in Iraq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, however, the atmosphere of the protest was different. It was not organised by an organisation and was absent of flags and banners brandishing a single group’s name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, people simply came to protest because they wanted to be there and directly communicate their concerns to the prime minister. That is why I felt the power of the message: it came from individuals. It was extraordinarily energizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing civil society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2008, I was arrested and later sentenced to a suspended prison term because I had stood up for the public good; exposing scandals in the subsidised Japanese whaling industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been an extremely hard fight to have the ideal of ‘freedom of expression’ recognised in conservative Japanese society. Generally, people have believed that the government and big corporations are always right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A parliamentary report released this week blamed lax safety measures at the country’s nuclear plants due to what it called the country’s powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is now starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 3/11 disaster has changed people’s understanding and undermined their trust in the government and big corporations. Citizens have become more critical of government information and are more open to protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, the protest spilled over from pedestrian paths onto the six-lane road in front of the prime minister’s house. Effectively, they marched on the street and occupied it. A follow-up protest will soon be held at the same location. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the first nuclear reactor was restarted this week, I am sure that politicians are feeling the power of ‘Revolution Hydrangea 紫陽花革命’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join us, support the citizens of Japan and be part of the Hydrangea Revolution.&lt;br&gt;Create a twitter storm to tell the Japanese Prime Minister Noda ‘#紫陽花革命’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply copy the Japanese characters (Saikado Hantai) below to tweet @kantei, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;再稼働反対 Japanese Prime Minister Noda, #DontRestartNukes. @kantei  #紫陽花革命&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together we can take hold of a nuclear-free future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saikado Hantai 再稼働反対!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junichi Sato is Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Kumi Naidoo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi was part of the successful struggle against apartheid in his native South Africa. He is an activist and a Rhodes Scholar.  For ten years he was the General Secretary of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation. Today he sits on the board of Greenpeace Africa and chairs the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the founders of &lt;a href="http://www.whiteband.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Call to Action Against Poverty&lt;/a&gt;, which has grown since 2005 into a coalition of anti-poverty campaigners from over 100 countries. They apply public pressure on leaders to fulfil promises on aid, trade, debt, climate change and gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi brings with him a passion for activism, for non-violence and clear ideas for shaping the future of Greenpeace. His experiences in campaigning, fundraising, advocacy, policy work, networked organisations and leading through change will all be called upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The way Greenpeace works on all levels from confrontation to cooperation with governments and corporations is an inspiration. The mix of pragmatism and passion really gets things done and effects real change in the world. I believe that Greenpeace is one of the most precious assets the global community posses as a critical part in reversing the current fatal trajectory of our planet," says Kumi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"History teaches us that real change only comes when good men and womenare prepared to put their lives and personal safety on the line toadvance the cause of justice, equity and peace. I believe today thatGreenpeace is the leading organization in embracing that approach."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Chair of the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA), of which Greenpeace is a member, for the coming months he will focus his attention on generating civil society pressure and cooperation to demand a strong deal at the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen this December:  one which gets CO2 emissions under control, protects tropical rainforests, and replaces dirty fossil fuel energy with renewables and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/management/executive-director/"&gt; Gerd Leipold&lt;/a&gt; will remain at the helm until November, and has this to say about the successor he has already worked closely with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kumi has all of the qualities needed to take Greenpeace forward and lead it in the greatest challenge it and the world has ever faced: climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/"&gt; Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt; (Stichting Greenpeace Council), is the body that coordinates global Greenpeace policy and strategy, and is based in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt; The best way to welcome Kumi? Take action, of course! Demand world leaders personally attend the Copenhagen summit&lt;/a&gt;, and take personal responsibility for sealing the right deal to save our planet from runaway climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>World's largest tuna destroyer - caught!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/albatuna-tres-062708/</url><text>
	We chased it for 5 days, but as dawn broke over the Pacific this morning we finally confronted the biggest tuna fishing vessel in the world. The Spanish-owned and flagged tuna purse seiner "Albatun Tres" is known as a 'super, super seiner' and can net 3,000 tonnes of tuna in a single fishing trip. This is almost double the entire annual catch of some Pacific island countries.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/the-most-devastatingly-efficie.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/the-most-devastatingly-efficie.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The most devastatingly efficient tuna fishing vessel in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught this monstrous tuna catcher deploying its net close to the Phoenix Islands of Kiribati and witnessed many tonnes of tuna being taken out of the Pacific. We laid a 25-metre floating banner reading "No Fish, No Future"' across the inside of the net as it was being hauled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first found the Albatun Tres on May 22nd and tracked her across more than 1,000 nautical miles. Her crew must have noticed us when we came within visual range as they immediately steamed away at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to catch up with them when they stopped to fish, and as they pulled in their catch we showed up in inflatable boats, a jet ski and helicopter in order to expose their plunderous activities to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BA7enHKa5As?rel=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purse seine vessels surround schools of fish with curtain-like nets to catch tuna. A rope along the bottom of the net is pulled like a drawstring and the whole catch is hauled onboard. These vessels have increased their efficiency enormously in the last decade through a variety of technological innovations. While targeting skipjack tuna, these vessels also catch juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, as we witnessed this morning. This bycatch is seriously threatening the already vulnerable stocks of bigeye and yellowfin tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign fishing nations including those of the European Union (EU) are fishing unsustainably where Pacific island countries depend on tuna for income and food. The Albatun Tres arrived in the Pacific from the Indian Ocean earlier this year. It is owned by the Spanish tuna company Albacora, which is part of OPAGAC, a powerful association of Spanish tuna boat owners, processors and traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No more fish at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery, the world's biggest, has been subjected to intense fishing by fleets from Asia and the United States since the 1960s. With declining tuna stocks in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the European Union has gained access to this Pacific fishing ground as a reciprocal benefit for giving aid to Pacific countries. With their own waters fished out, the EU and other foreign fishing fleets including Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the US, are literally sailing across the world to take vital fish and income from people whose lives depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe align="middle" frameborder="0" height="430" scrolling="no" src="http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?user_id=16093524@N00&amp;amp;set_id=72157605296853768" width="430"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super seiners of OPAGAC have a questionable history in the region and some of the vessels which they currently represent were pirate fishing in the area last year. Just when the Pacific fishing fleets need to be reduced we have found evidence to show that OPAGAC is trying to expand their fishing capacity here. This group of companies has no shame and targets the poorest and most vulnerable countries in order to gain access to Pacific waters. Greenpeace is urging Pacific island countries to cease any future dealings with OPAGAC. Vessels of this size need to be taken off the water and scrapped immediately in order to address the overcapacity of the world's tuna fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship Esperanza has been in the region for the last eight weeks highlighting the overfishing of tuna. During this time we have taken action against fishing fleets from Taiwan, Korea, the US, the Philippines and now Spain.  At the same time, our ship Arctic Sunrise has been taking action against overfishing of tuna &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/"&gt; in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Dead oceans? Dead planet. Help us preserve one of the planet's life support systems by setting aside 40 percent of the world's oceans as marine reserves. Our seas need time to recover.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Help keep our ships at sea and our activists in action. We don't accept money from governments or corporations, but rely on millions of people all over the world like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Food Security and Forest Protection in Cameroon</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/forests/solutions/Cameroon-Forest-Workshops/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Communities discuss innovations in small-scale farming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Responding to a recent spate of industrial palm oil projects in Cameroon, Greenpeace Africa is working with a Cameroonian NGO to show how small-scale farming projects are a better development option -- for communities on the ground and Cameroon's rainforests. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The rich forests of South West Cameroon support thousands of communities, by providing food, building materials and medicine. Greenpeace Africa is working with Cameroonian NGO ACDIC (Association Citoyenne pour la Defense des Interêts Collectifs) to assess how small-scale farming can offer a responsible development path, in contrast to a proposed industrial palm oil plantation in the region, which threatens local livelihoods and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/set1.jpg" alt="Cameroon Rainforest" width="720" height="274"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;The rainforest is home to many communities and is also a biodiversity hotspot of global importance. African Forest Elephants, whose numbers have collapsed due to habitat loss, still roam here, and endangered chimpanzees chatter in the canopy above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, representatives of local communities came together at a workshop held by Greenpeace Africa and ACDIC in the town of Kumba on April 16, to share ideas on &lt;a href="/international/Global/africa/publications/forests/Agriculture_FoodSecurity_EN.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;how to ensure food security and forest protection&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 90 people attended, and identified technical support for farmers, access to land, and producing food locally for local consumption as some of the key factors in achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/set2.jpg" alt="Community Resistance"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Communities affected by the Herakles project are mobilising themselves and investigating sustainable alternatives to industrial palm oil projects. Greenpeace has been working with local partners on the ground to support these efforts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a positive and viable alternative to the 73,000 hectare palm oil project proposed by US-based corporation Herakles Farms, which would jeopardize the livelihoods of more than 14,000 people who currently live and farm in the concession area. Fearful of losing their lands and livelihoods, some local people have protested against the project, and have faced intimidation and arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="274" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rPjacVLoApY?rel=0" width="687"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Watch this short video to find out more about the proposed Herakles palm oil project and the likely impact it will have on local communities, biodiversity, and the forest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for the palm oil industry and investors to implement a transparent ‘Zero Deforestation Policy’, which respects the rights and livelihoods of local communities and ensures the protection of natural forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="h11"&gt;Get Involved&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/exclamation.jpg" alt="action" width="84" height="96"&gt;Right now, the most important thing we can do to protect Cameroon's rainforest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is call for the Herakles palm oil project to be stopped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-africa/en/campaigns/Forests-hub/Palm-Oil-Deforestation/Save-the-Cameroonian-rainforest----stop-the-Herakles-Farms-project/" target="_blank"&gt;Take action here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/"&gt; Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt; (Stichting Greenpeace Council), is the body that coordinates global Greenpeace policy and strategy, and is based in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt; The best way to welcome Kumi? Take action, of course! Demand world leaders personally attend the Copenhagen summit&lt;/a&gt;, and take personal responsibility for sealing the right deal to save our planet from runaway climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

	700 volunteers posed nude in a French vineyard to send a message about climate change. This human art installation in the South of Burgundy was created by artist Spencer Tunick - to warn about the dangers of global warming.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Naked message: global warming could mean an end to the days of wine... and rosés.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Parental warning: the story below contains nudity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Dirty Laundry Reloaded into your washing-machine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/Detox-campaign/Dirty-Laundry-Reloaded-into-your-washing-machine/</url><text>
	Global fashion brands are turning us into unwitting polluters. This is what we discovered in our latest research conducted on clothing and sportswear produced by big companies such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Ralph Lauren and G-Star. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03T7L.jpg" alt="How big brands are making consumers unwitting accomplices in the toxic water cycle" width="600" height="127"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested products that we &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt;knew contained residues of toxic substances&lt;/a&gt; by washing them under conditions that simulated domestic laundering. Then we measured how much of the chemicals remained in the clothing. In this way we could identify the percentage of "washed out" chemicals which end up being flushed into our rivers, lakes and seas, where they break down to form even more hazardous substances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are these substances?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These chemicals have some nasty properties. For example, NPEs breaks down into nonylphenols, chemicals which are persistent, bio-accumulative and hormone-disrupting. This means that they do not break down easily into the environment, build up in the food chain, and can seriously mess with some organisms' hormone systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03TE0.jpg" alt="Clothing and the Global Toxic Water Cycle" width="600" height="335"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigative work: Dirty Laundry part one, two and three.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year we published &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/" target="_blank"&gt;our investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealing how the suppliers of major clothing brands were discharging hazardous chemicals in their waste water directly into Chinese rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We challenged the brands found to be in business with these suppliers to take responsibility for this pollution, and to use their considerable influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate these toxic discharges throughout their supply chain and products.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p class="description"&gt;As much as 70 percent of China's rivers, lakes and reservoirs are affected by water pollution. During our recent investigations, Greenpeace identified links between a number of major clothing brands and textile factories in China that are releasing hazardous chemicals into our rivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;Some brands accepted&lt;/a&gt; the challenge and have begun working on a detailed plan to reach the goal by 2020. Others insisted that these chemicals were not used in their manufacturing their products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We tested the products of a number of the brands linked to these suppliers and found residues of hazardous chemicals in their clothing proving that these hazardous substances had been used in the manufacturing of their products. The results of this investigation were published in the report&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt; 'Dirty Laundry - Hung out to dry'&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The residues we found might seem small in quantity if considered compared to the single piece of clothing. But there is no safe amount of toxic chemicals, and given the huge volume of garments produced by these global brands, the total quantities of these chemicals entering our water is far from insignificant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our latest investigation tested clothing we had found containing these hazardous substances to find out what happens during normal washing conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results implicate anyone who buys these brands and washes their clothes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03T7K.jpg" alt="NPE Maps" width="487" height="536"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textile industry is creating water pollution &lt;strong&gt;all around the globe&lt;/strong&gt;, including those regions and countries where there are restrictions or bans on the use of these chemicals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero discharge of hazardous chemicals within a generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire textile sector needs to move to toxic-free processes. To reach this goal we need more brands joining the detox challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the companies which have already committed to the elimination of the use of these substances, the next step is for them to respond to the urgency of the situation by setting strict and ambitious elimination deadlines for the most hazardous chemicals used by this sector, including nonylphenol ethoxylates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know these chemicals are dangerous, and viable alternatives exist so these big brand names need to turn their words into actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of you already joined together to put pressure on these brands to "Detox", and thanks to your efforts, Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&amp;amp;M, Li-Ning and C&amp;amp;A have all committed to eliminate the use of all hazardous chemicals from their supply chain and products by 2020 .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;You can take action today by:&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing this story with your friends and family to help raise awareness of the issue&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/People-Power/" target="_blank"&gt;latest campaign video &lt;/a&gt;which shows the role of #PeoplePower in shaking up the fashion sector &lt;br&gt;-    &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/what-you-can-do/star-in-our-next-video/" target="_blank"&gt;Submitting your photo &lt;/a&gt;to help star in the next #PeoplePowered campaign video while pushing your favorite brand to be the next to Detox&lt;/p&gt;

	A container ship currently heading from southern India to the US represents a small victory in the fight against corporate crime across the globe. The ship is carrying 320 tonnes of toxic mercury contaminated waste which comes from a closed plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of consumer products giant Unilever.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unilever agrees to clean up its toxic mercury mess in south India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unilever mercury thermometer production plant was set up in TamilNadu, India in 1983 after being shipped wholesale from it previous location in New York State in the US. It is a classic tactic of the chemical industry to ship plants that are too dirty or inefficient for the US or Europe to areas such as India and extend their life where environmental and safety standards are lower. Hence the industry can continue to make profits from pollution for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Moving the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant at Kodaikanal imported mercury from the US and re-exported the thermometers back to the US. Mercury is a potent toxin affecting the nervous system of people and animals and a highly dangerous pollutant. Lax safety standards at the plant left workers with mercury poisoning and large amounts of mercury contaminated waste were dumped in the surrounding areas in complete disregard for the local communities by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local environmental groups and Greenpeace first exposed the mercury dumping scandal in May 2001. Subsequent protests by locals forced the closure of the plant but the contaminated waste was left littering the site and surrounding area. Investigations by the pollution control authorities revealed the pollution to be far worse than the company had admitted with soil contamination 600-800 the legal levels and approximately 17 times more mercury was unaccounted for than the company estimates. The authorities ordered the company to clean up the site and safely treat the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananthapadmanabhan, one of our campaigners in India, is studying the clean up: "We will be keeping a close watch on all future remedial actions by the company. Several thousand tonnes of toxic wastes and contaminated soil are still to be properly identified and contained. Now that the clean up has begun in earnest, compensation and health care for affected ex-workers should be immediately brought on to the agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste will be treated at a special plant in the US. The start of the clean up is a big victory for campaigners in India where other polluted hotspots cause by irresponsible companies, like Bhopal, abound.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mister Splashy Pants the whale - you named him, now save him</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/splashy-101207/</url><text>
	Out of 11,000 submissions in our competition to name the humpback whales we were tracking on their migration to the Southern Ocean, we narrowed it down to the final 30. Over 150,000 people then voted for their favourite name. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mister Splashy Pants is the winner by a nautical mile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/humpback-whales-southern-ocea.jpg" alt="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." width="600" height="395"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the world couldn't get enough of Mister Splashy Pants with many websites encouraging their readers to vote for 'Splashy'. And as we all know, once the wonderful world of the internet got hold of Mister Splashy Pants, it was all over bar the final splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants got a huge 119,367 votes (over 78 percent of the vote) with his nearest rival being Humphrey at 4,329 (less than 3 percent). The rest of the top ten were Aiko, Libertad, Mira, Kaimana, Aurora, Shanti, Amal and Manami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many websites also took credit for the rise and rise of the Splashy-Panted One. Some websites encouraged their readers to cheat and vote more than once, while others like &lt;a href="http://treehugger.com/"&gt;Treehugger&lt;/a&gt; seemed to imply that Mister Splashy Pants wasn't a proper name for a whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sure Treehugger didn't mean it that way but it resulted in a final wave of votes from their readers that took Splashy to an unreachable position at the top of the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who voted for Mister Splashy Pants, now that you've named him, it's time to save him - he might have a great name but he and his friends are still in danger. The only way to be 100 percent sure that 'Splashy' doesn't get harpooned is to stop killing all whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people who voted for a name other than Mister Splashy Pants, take heart. The scientists involved in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt; Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt; tagged 20 humpback whales in the South Pacific. The top 7 names will be used to name whales with a further 5 whales being named by our Whale Defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, a big thanks to YOU, the people who made the name-a-whale competition so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McVictory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Victory as fast food giant pledges to help protect the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict. Reaching the most affected populations with the aid continuesto be a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.southpacificrfmo.org/" target="blank"&gt;countries around the world gathered in Chile&lt;/a&gt; to carve out a fisheries agreement for the South Pacific region. Following a &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/general_assembly/general_assembly_resolutions.htm" target="blank"&gt;resolution made by the UN in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, the countries at the meeting responded strongly with measures to stop destruction of deep water corals, seamounts and other sensitive habitats by vessels that  are bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From September 2007 bottom trawling vessels in the South Pacific will not be able to fish in areas that have or are even likely to have vulnerable marine ecosystems, unless they've completed an assessment to show they won't do any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand fishing industry is responsible for 90 percent of bottom trawling in the region. New Zealand delegates told the meeting these measures would "severely constrain the ability of their fishing industry to continue bottom trawling on the high seas around New Zealand"  and suggested that it may even have the effect of putting an end to bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be watching to make sure that New Zealand - and all the member countries - put the agreement into action, and implement the measures that will protect the irreplaceable biodiversity of deep sea ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rushmore activists sentenced for civil disobedience</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/civil-disobedience-in-jail-050110/</url><text>
	Civil disobedience to stop climate change had its day in court in the US yesterday when activists pled guilty to climbing Mount Rushmore with their message demanding Obama take leadership on climate change. Four other climate activists who have spent three weeks in jail in Copenhagen for gate crashing a Head of State dinner still await their first hearing.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what civil disobedience for the climate looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eleven climate activists who proudly staged an historic protest at Mount Rushmore last July appeared in court yesterday for sentencing. All eleven pled guilty to the charge of Climbing Mount Rushmore and received a fine of US$ 460 each. They will also perform 50-100 hours of community service in the National Park system depending on their individual sentences. The judge requested that some or all of that service be performed at Mt. Rushmore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three further charges against the activists were dismissed, as were all charges against Greenpeace.  In a civil decree, Greenpeace has agreed to pay a sum of US$ 30,866, most of which will go to conservation and public park programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single activist who has a history of peaceful civil disobedience was sentenced to 2 days of jail time, which he has already begun serving.&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all the activists, Jessica Miller delivered a statement on the steps of the courthouse: "We climbed Mount Rushmore because we wanted to send a message to President Obama that this is an issue that is important to us, and to the future generations who will face the increasing impacts of global warming, like drought, severe weather and the loss of millions of lives around the world. Global warming is the most important crisis our generation must tackle, and it is time for all of us to stand up to stop it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action at Rushmore sent loud call for climate leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 8th, 2009, Greenpeace activists draped an enormous banner to the right of Lincoln's head on Mt. Rushmore. The banner bore an image of President Obama and read, "America Honors Leaders, Not Politicians: Stop Global Warming" - a challenge to President Obama to take a strong stance on climate change in the leadup to December's UN climate summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Civil disobedience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Copenhagen, where leaders failed to take action to stop climate change, four Greenpeace activists are still &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-heroes-pay-231209/"&gt; held in jail without trial&lt;/a&gt; for taking action against climate change. By the time they can see a judge, they will have spent three weeks in jail without a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the most important issue the world faces today. If our leaders do not act, individual citizens have the right to resort to civil disobedience to protect the future of our planet.  Actions designed to spur politicians to action against global warming are themselves a form of community service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt;After the failure of Copenhagen, the future of the planet rests in your hands. Act now, change the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Danish police today released from custody four Greenpeace climate protesters who have endured 20 days of pre-trial detention in Copenhagen prison following a harmless peaceful protest staged on the evening of 17 December. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Free at last! "Red Carpet Four" activists speak with journalists after their release from prison. They were held without trial for 20 days.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20 days in prison without trial, the four activists who became known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-heroes-pay-231209/"&gt; "Red Carpet Four"&lt;/a&gt; have been released from prison. Their "crime"? Impressing on world leaders the urgency of action on climate change at a State dinner during the Copenhagen climate summit. Their release comes a day in advance of their detention being reviewed by a Danish judge. However, the four activists still face trial in the Danish courts, and possible prison sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unnecessary detention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the arrests of the Four, Greenpeace guaranteed - as it does in cases where volunteers are involved in peaceful protests - that, if the activists were released, they would voluntarily return to Copenhagen to stand trial. To further facilitate the police investigation, Greenpeace consistently offered its full co-operation to Danish police and provided them with comprehensive details of the activity. A request from Greenpeace asking the Danish police to specify what additional information they needed to know in connection with the case was met with two weeks of silence on the part of the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such prolonged pre-trial detention appears to be a flagrant violation of key articles of international human rights &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;agreements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British human rights lawyer Richard Harvey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only on Tuesday 5 January, did Danish police finally request the names of other individuals who had been in the Greenpeace 'motorcade' on 17 December. Today, these individuals volunteered their details, removing the last conceivable reason for detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish police proved unco-operative in the face of honest efforts on our part to find compromise. As a result, the four activists spent Christmas and New Year in jail, far from their family and without visitation rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Necessary action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 17 December, three of the activists posed as the "Head of State of the Natural World", his "wife" and their security detail. They were waved through the security cordon surrounding the Danish Parliament. Arriving inside the venue for the State banquet they unfolded banners reading, "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of State met the next day for the final sessions of the Copenhagen climate summit. They came no further than producing an empty shell of a document - the 'Copenhagen Accord'. Only five pages in length - two of which contain only blank tables - it contains no legally binding targets for limiting emissions of global warming gases. The summit merely "noted" but did not adopt the Accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24934/delegation-from-earth-about-to.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 13,000 people gave their support to the Red Carpet Four in 24 hours, and announced their support for future civil disobedience. Action is needed and expected from true world leaders in the face of the grave threat of Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, world leaders let the opportunity for agreeing a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement slip through their fingers. We cannot let them fail again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as our 'leaders' behave like 'losers', and continue to drag their feet, they can expect more and more people to find creative ways of expressing their concern and building up pressure for change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our four activists who grabbed global media attention last week after being waved through the security cordon and allowed to gatecrash the Heads of State dinner at the Copenhagen climate summit will be spending Christmas and New Year in jail without trial, the Danish High Court has ruled.

            Greenpeace's state dinner gatecrashers deliver climate message in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave up their freedom to get a message out calling for action against climate. Don't let in be in vain. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt; Please support our new campaign to keep the pressure on world leaders for a real climate deal in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the Heroes from Norway, Spain and Switzerland were arrested after entering the banquet for world leaders, hosted by the Danish Queen Margrethe II. Two of them were dressed as a 'Head of State' and his 'wife', the third their security detail. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/xmas-in-jail-for-climate-activists201209/"&gt; They held up banners that read "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act"&lt;/a&gt; and were led away by police. Danish police later pulled in a fourth activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While real world leaders came to the summit, ate cake, and departed with an empty political agreement that leaves the future of the planet and millions of lives in peril, our four activists will be held in police custody without bail or trial until January 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-violent, creative action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace's Climate Heroes were willing to risk their freedom for a cause," said Mads Christensen, Executive Director of Greenpeace Nordic. "Preventing them from spending the festive season with their families and loved ones is effectively a punishment without trial and has the appearance of a vindictive act. It is unnecessary and totally out of proportion to what they did", said Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condemning the High Court's decision as a further "climate injustice" on top of the collossal political failure at the summit, we're is calling on the public to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwqGDF9IBKQ"&gt;help step up pressure&lt;/a&gt; for the activists' release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the High Court's ruling, their freedom remains at the discretion of Denmark's Chief of Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using only simple props, creativity and a little "audacity of hope" the activists arrived ahead of Hillary Clinton, carrying out an entirely peaceful call for action. Their message helped give voice to the hundreds of millions of people who rarely get the ear of politicians, even as their lives and ecosystems are progressively destroyed as politicians waffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24936/climate_shame.jpg" alt="Climate Shame protest after Copenhagen summit cop-out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Real Crime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historic climate summit which people around the world have been anticipating for the last year resulted in &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/copenhagen-wrap-up-191209/"&gt; what is called the 'Copenhagen Accord'&lt;/a&gt; - an empty document containing no legally binding commitments for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mads Christensen summed up the situation: "Over the past 20 years, our leaders have done virtually nothing to combat climate change. The Copenhagen climate summit was the moment for decisive action. But our leaders failed us. They failed to agree a legally binding treaty to prevent the Earth from warming beyond the crucial threshold of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond this, we can expect impacts to severely affect the survival and wellbeing of millions of people and countless species. Failure to take action to protect the climate is not an option."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act Now - Change the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt;It's time to put politicians on notice! Every email raised in protest about their failure is a step towards forcing them to act in all our interests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make a donation&lt;/h3&gt;

	Four of our activists face the prospect of Christmas in jail this year over charges relating to our crashing of the Head of State dinner at the Copenhagen climate summit, while the leaders who did practically nothing about the greatest threat to our planet got away scott free.

            Delegation from Earth about to be evicted from Danish Queen's dinner party with 100 heads of state at Copenhagen climate summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called for the immediate release of our people at a candle-lit vigil on Saturday night outside the Vestre Fængsel prison, in Copenhagen. Over 100 Greenpeace staff and supporters held banners reading "Freedom From Climate Injustice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/news/features/jail-for-action-to-save-our-pl/"&gt;Click here for short biographies of the activists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crime Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Copenhagen has become a 'climate crime scene' after over 120 Heads of State squandered an historic opportunity to agree a climate saving deal," said Kumi Naidoo, our International Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the perpetrators of the real crime fled the country on private jets, it is shocking that the Danish authorities have decided to detain, without trial, four peaceful protesters over Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Their families will spend a bleak festive season knowing that their loved ones will be languishing in isolation for acting to save the climate. For standing up in defense of the hundreds of millions of people and countless species which will be severely affected by catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kids around the Christmas tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the activists have children at home who will be missing a parent this Christmas. The activists - Juan Lopez de Uralde, Nora Christiansen and Christian Schmutz - are the climate heroes who brought home to world leaders attending last Thursday's banquet with Queen Margrethe the message that leaders were failing the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, police also arrested Joris Thijssen, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace International. He is being held under the same conditions as the other three activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copenhagen has become a 'climate crime scene' after over 120 Heads of State squandered an historic opportunity to agree a climate saving &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists joined Heads of State from over 120 countries en route to the banquet at the Danish Parliament. Arriving in a three-vehicle convoy, immediately in front of Hilary Clinton, a Greenpeace 'Head of State' and his 'wife' stepped out onto the red carpet as representatives of the millions of people around the world who wanted a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty to head-off climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding up banners reading: "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act", the activists demanded action and not merely words from Presidents and Prime Ministers during their Friday session of the climate summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How far will you go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders have failed us. They have walked away from the global summit in Copenhagen without a treaty to save the climate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not done yet, and neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 15 million people joined in the call from Greenpeace and the other tcktcktck partners such as Avaaz, 350, Oxfam, and WWF, to demand a fair, ambitious, binding treaty to stop climate change. And until we have that, we're going to continue building the biggest mass movement the world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juantxo, Joris, Nora, and Christian were willing to risk jail time to do something about climate change. What are you going to do? You can start by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/become-a-climate-activist?appeal_id=000"&gt; signing up as a climate activist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International and chair of the TckTckTck campaign.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tens of millions of people around the world who have been working so long and so hard for a fair, ambitious and legally binding (FAB) treaty to come out of the Copenhagen climate summit, I held on to my hope until the very end. My hope our leaders would stop talking and start acting. That they would agree a treaty to avert the threat of climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope has been dashed. Despite a mandate from citizens around the world, and over 120 world leaders attending the Summit, the bickering continued. Our leaders did not lead, they did not act. The summit has failed to produce anything that could be called a FAB deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a chance to change the world. To seize the day, and put us on a path way to peace and prosperity. To embark on a path of climate justice. In doing so, they could have banished the spectre of catastrophic climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust went missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust between developed and developing countries played a large role in preventing any real progress. Leaders from industrialised countries have had plenty of time to commit to ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions and to find the billions of dollars needed to help developing countries both adapt to and mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries showed a willingness throughout the year to take on their share of the effort. Developed countries  failed to move far enough. Bringing up the rear has been the US. It must take the lion's share of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beating climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists around the world tell us we have to ensure global emissions peak by 2015 in order to avoid average global temperature rising more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, industrialised countries as a group - which have the greatest historic responsibility for the problem - must make the largest emission cuts. They also need to provide at least USD 140 billion a year to help developing countries get onto a clean energy pathway, to protect tropical forests, and to adapt to those climate change impacts that are unfortunately now inevitable.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any agreement must be enshrined in a legally binding treaty. This is the job the politicians did not do in Copenhagen.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make them finish what they started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now our job -  yours and mine - to make sure  our 'leaders' see sense, get back to work  get the job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, like many other groups around the world, will continue to peacefully pressure our leaders to do what must be done to save human lives and protect species which cannot speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people are recognising the urgency of climate change. We believe there is an historic inevitability of forcing nations to act. The question is, whether we can force them to take the necessary action soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The final rub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel irony I have just learned that the three Greenpeace activists who, posing as world leaders, entered the Danish Palace for the State Dinner on Thursday night to unfurl a banner calling for a real climate deal are to spend the next three weeks in jail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be away from their families over Christmas and the New Year. The real  leaders, who attempted to get real action are now in jail, while the alleged 'leaders' got clean away, and are fleeing the Copenhagen climate crime scene in private jets and 747s.&lt;/p&gt;

            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace spectacularly crashes Queen's dinner party at Copenhagen Climate summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-spectacularly-crash/</url><text>
	We thought it unfair that among the Heads of State invited to the Queen's dinner in Copenhagen, that a representative of the whole planet wasn't invited. Earth needed a voice, it needed representation. So we sent two to crash the party.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Delegation from Earth about to be evicted from Danish Queen's dinner party with 100 heads of state at Copenhagen climate summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the Copenhagen climate summit comes to a close, the future of our planet lies in the hands of world leaders that have just breezed into town. And somehow, instead of getting down to the nitty gritty, they were dining with the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders might have been expecting just another photo opportunity in Copenhagen, but that was before we invited ourselves to dinner. We thought they might need a reminder it's time to step forward and steer these climate negotiations in the right direction on the final day of talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only precious hours left till the end of the summit, activists in a three-car convoy joined the motorcade, carrying our very own Head of State to the dinner at the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival, our distinguished representative and her husband entered the dinner and held up two banners reading "Politicians Talk Leaders Act." They were there to represent the 11 million of you that have demanded that world leaders take personal responsibility at the summit and deliver a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure they got the message loud and clear, 25 activists scaled lampposts outside of the security cordon with banners demanding action from the world leaders on their way to dinner.  "Don't betray our children's future" was projected onto the Parliament building itself, as well as the Prime Minister's office, in English, French and German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the industrialised world has failed to show anything like the leadership that is urgently needed to get a deal that will prevent climate change from spiraling out of control. Their lack of action will condemn millions of people to ever-increasing impacts of climate chaos. We can't let them get away with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, they promised us a real deal to save the climate and that deal would be agreed in Copenhagen, now. The time has come for world leaders to deliver on their promises and sign a deal with long term financing, ambitious emissions cuts and that is legally binding. They have the power to make it happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your voice heard and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;join the 13 million people that have demanded action on climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;13 Million people have demanded a fair ambitious binding treaty to stop climate change. Let's make it 15 million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;Your contributions are what keep us in action. We don't let corporations or governments feed us, so we're free to bite their hands. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Want to help make the future a better place?  Support us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/12/barack-obama.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/12/barack-obama.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; 
&lt;object width="430" height="242" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8117722&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=0&amp;amp;show_byline=0&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00ADEF&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our urgent message to save the climate is resounding around the world now - thanks to individuals like you who support us. Please give what you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate negotiations kick off</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-copenhagen-kickoff071109/</url><text>
	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="act"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt; Read our key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict. Reaching the most affected populations with the aid continuesto be a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	Perhaps more than anyone else, Bob Hunter invented Greenpeace.  His death on May 2nd 2005, of cancer, marks the passing of a true original, one of the heroes of the environmental movement. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bob Hunter (left) with Ben Metcalfe, aboard the first Greenpeace voyage to oppose nuclear weapons testing in Amchitka.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the word "Greenpeace" hadn't yet been coined. Bob was a hippy journalist in Vancouver, a town which he described as having "the biggest concentration of tree-huggers, radicalized students, garbage-dump stoppers, shit-disturbing unionists, freeway fighters, pot smokers and growers, aging Trotskyites, condo killers, farmland savers, fish preservationists, animal rights activists, back-to-the-landers, vegetarians, nudists, Buddhists, and anti-spraying, anti-pollution marchers and picketers in the country, per capita, in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind bombs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student of Marshall McLuhan, he was bent on changing the world with what he termed "media mindbombs" -- consciousness-changing sounds and images to blast around the world in the guise of news. He got involved with a few folks in a church basement who wanted to stop a US nuclear weapons test off Amchitka, which he called the "Don't Make a Wave Committee".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sailing into the bomb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their plans were going nowhere until Marie Bohlen suggested that the group simply sail a ship into the test site. Bob thought it was a perfect "mindbomb," and on September 15, 1971, he and 11 other rag-tag activists would sail out to challenge the greatest military force on Earth in a rusting fishing boat they called "The Greenpeace." In doing so, they set off a wave of public support and protest which closed the US-Canadian border for the first time since 1812, ultimately shut the testing programme down, and created a new force for environmental and peace activism which continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace bears his mark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, Bob's madcap creativity, strategic smarts, and hard-nosed journalistic sense of story would indelibly mark the Greenpeace brand of action. From the pack ice of Newfoundland, where he dyed the whitecoats of Harp Seal pups to make them commercially worthless, to the Pacific Ocean where he stood between Russian harpoons and the whales they were hunting, he inspired a new brand of personal environmental activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaman, mystic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bob was a storyteller, a shaman, a word-magician, a Machiavellian mystic, and he dared to inject a sense of humour into the often shrill and sanctimonious job of changing the world," says Greenpeace Executive Director Gerd Leipold. "He was funny and brave and audacious, inspiring in his refusal to accept the limits of the practical or the probable. He revelled in life's ability to deliver little miracles in the form of impossibilities achieved, and Greenpeace will forever bear the mark of his crazy, super-optimistic faith in the wisdom of tilting at windmills."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warriors of the Rainbow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Hunter chronicled the birth of Greenpeace in his book "Warriors of the Rainbow." It was a masterful feat of storytelling, one which attracted a further generation of young people into the ranks of the organisation. In its introduction he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We fought... an unequal battle against American and French nuclear weapons makers; Russian, Japanese, and Australian whalers; Norwegian and Canadian seal hunters; multinational oil consortiums and pesticide manufactures; cynical politicians; angry workers; and, again and again, ourselves. The people involved were men and women, young and old, not all of them brave or wise, who found themselves face-to-face with the fullest ecological horrors of the century..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storymaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Hunter's stock stories was the tale of how he'd stumbled on to the Cree Indian myth of the "Warriors of the Rainbow" -- a legendary tribe of spirits who would rescue nature when the Earth became sick. The story involved a gypsy dulcimer maker, an old set of fenceposts, and the gift of a book which Hunter claimed leapt into his hands -- quite literally -- when The Greenpeace dropped down a steep swell on its way to Amchitka. The story itself was magical and mythological, and over the years Hunter would embellish and polish it into a hilarious and inspirational piece of campfire folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awful child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1941. In his own words "I was an awful, rebellious, early attention-defficient kid who was loved by my art and English teachers, but hated by the rest. I cheated by scribbling novels when I was supposed to be doing schoolwork." He became a journalist for the Winnipeg Tribune and later wrote a column for the Vancouver Sun in which he featured environmental subjects. He quit writing the column when he joined the first Greenpeace voyage to save the whales, becoming a reporter explicitly to ensure his somewhat less than objective "message" would reach a global audience, because "the subjective stuff written by columnists [was] never picked up by the wire services."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalism as opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He readily confessed that this made him "a traitor to my profession," but believed he had a higher calling: "If we ignore [the] laws of ecology we will continue to be guilty of crimes against the earth. We will not be judged by men for these crimes, but with a justice meeted out by the earth itself. The destruction of the earth will lead, inevitably, to the destruction of ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter became president of the Greenpeace Foundation in 1973, and served in that post until 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Toronto's City TV as an ecology specialist in 1988, and for years hosted a highly successful morning TV spot for Breakfast TV in his bathrobe, in which he read the day's newspaper headlines and sputtered scandalously witty commentaries in a form of rapid-fire stand-up journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisor, speaker, comedian-in-chief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years he continued to contribute to Greenpeace as an advisor and occasional speaker, and kept up good relations with the organisation's original luminaries, including many who were no longer on speaking terms with one other. He authored several books and founded a tongue-in-cheek religion, the Whole Earth Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent book, Rex Weyler writes about reflecting with Hunter on their experiences in the early days of Greenpeace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ironies and tension of history simultaneously provided the gift of history: that we got to live, to see the flourishing Earth, the flying fish, dolphins, caribou, seal pups, the raging sea, the blue light of morning, the miracle and terror of survival all rolled into one; and that we were blessed with an opportunity to serve it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Hunter made much of his opportunity to serve the Earth, and Greenpeace will always be blessed with his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

	"It is 8:30 am and I and 30 activists have been sitting on drilling platform #4 for an hour and a half. We can see workers from the Defense Construction Agency gathering on the beach of Camp Schwab, the US Marine Corp base at Henoko, Okinawa. They are about to board a chartered fishing boat and come out and try to drill the first of 64 holes into the life sustaining coral reef. But for the 300th consecutive day, we are not going to let them." - Yuka Ozaki, 500m off the coast of Japan.

        &lt;p&gt;
            A gentle dugong near Okinawa, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, construction of a US Marine Corps airbase for helicopters at Henoko, Okinawa, off the coast of Japan was agreed. The planned 2,600-meter runway complete with hangers, control towers and fuel storage was even being funded by Japanese taxpayers to the tune of US$10 billion. That US$10 billion is set to pay for the destruction of the habitat of sea life such as the gentle dugong - only 12 of which are confirmed to remain in Japanese waters. The beautiful Okinawa reef is home to Japan's last remaining population of critically endangered dugong, as well as other marine mammals and sea turtles. The UN Environment Programme has called for the creation of a marine reserve to protect the dugong. Instead the plan is to dynamite the reef and build the runway through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local opposition has been so strong that construction was not started until late 2004. In 1997, local people voted overwhelmingly to reject the base, but the local mayor was forced by the central government to agree to the project. He resigned in disgrace after signing the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.or.jp/dugong/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25875/okinawa_action.jpg" alt="" align="middle" border="0"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org/henoko" target="_blank"&gt;Make the virtual airbase disappear in the online protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courageous local residents, however, have so far been successful in preventing the drilling of test holes into the sensitive coral reef. Every day for the last 300 days they have occupied the drilling towers about half a kilometre offshore, preventing any further construction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 84-year-old local man said, "We know for sure, that building the airbase is not the right thing to do. There are a plenty of sea creatures which are supporting our life here. We always appreciate the richness of ocean life: we have top shell, octopus, magaki-shell and seaweed. Once the base is built, there will be no future for our children. I can't let it disappear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Rainbow Warrior arrives to support these local residents and try to ensure a US military base doesn't mean the demise of the Okinawa dugong.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the Cargill port being built in violation of Brazilian law, it continues to operate. Soy exported from this port go to many parts of the world including Europe where it is used to feed animals destined to be fried-up in fast food outlets like KFC.  Activists in Europe have &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/greenpeace-slams-us-commoditie/"&gt; shut down Cargill plants in France and the UK&lt;/a&gt; in solidarity with their Brazilian colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a report from Gavin Edwards, our international forest campaigner, about his arrival in Brazil:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been in the Amazon almost a week now and from the moment I arrived I stepped into a very polarized battle over the future of the Amazon. My first indication of the tension was a bumper sticker on a truck outside the airport with the words 'Fora Greenpeace', meaning 'Greenpeace Out'. Many more of these stickers were on trucks around the town of Santarem. It turns out that by showing this sticker on your car or truck, you receive a discount on petrol at a local gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An editorial in the local newspaper Journal de Santarem was also quite damning of Greenpeace, attempting to link us to everything from hunger to abortion, but of course failed to discuss the real issue, the ongoing and rampant deforestation and unsustainable development in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first protest involved simply parachuting an activist into a soy field with a message written on the parachute, and even this was enough to bring out a small group of angry farmers -- the parachutist had a narrow escape. Our next attempt to protest at the forest destruction over the weekend was to have 80 people in a deforested area to make a human banner, arranging the people's bodies to spell out the protest message. This activity was cancelled due to the strong possibility of violence from the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="KFC banner" src="/international/PageFiles/25551/kfcbanner.jpg" alt="KFC banner" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the violence directed towards us, a team of activists on boats projected a video on soy and deforestation in front of the town of Santarem on Saturday night. Many of the local &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos &lt;/span&gt;are actually farmers from the south of Brazil who have recently moved to Santarem in pursuit of land grabbing and profits from deforestation and farming.  Their reaction was swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes a mob assembled and began firing fireworks at our volunteers. They assaulted one of our photographers, and the photographer of a local newspaper as well. This time it seems the local hooligans (who are a small minority) went too far, and the mood in Santarem has swung against them. The subsequent editorial in the Gazeta de Santarem is quite different from earlier criticisms. It deplores the use of violence by the farmers, questions why the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos&lt;/span&gt; are being violent towards Greenpeace, and wonders if the&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; gauchos &lt;/span&gt;will next turn on the people of Santarem with their tactics of fear and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gazeta de Santarem has front-page headlines and photos of the soy producers attacking the photographer, and a quote from one soy producer saying that Santarem is only full of Indians and lazy people. Now the bumper stickers on trucks seem to be fewer and fewer. The tide may well be turning against the soy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're keeping up the pressure on the big soy producers like Cargill over the next few days, including unfurling a protest banner in a deforested area today with the words '&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken – Amazon Criminal&lt;/span&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more activities planned in the Amazon, and we're sure those with an economic interest in forest destruction will continue with their violent tactics. For now however, it seems that peace is beginning to win over violence in Santarem, and it looks like there is a real chance that the Amazon may remain mostly green, if our supporters keep up the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>forests</value><value>amazon</value><value>soy</value><value>ancient forests</value><value>forests</value><value>soya</value></taxonomy><date>2006-05-18 00:00:00</date></item>
<item><language>en</language><title>Asian Tsunami: environmental and humanitarian disaster</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tsunami-and-the-environment/</url><text>
	On December 26 a massive tsunami swept through the Indian Ocean region to become arguably the largest natural disaster in living memory. Questions are now being asked: what are the environmental impacts of this tragedy?  Did damaged environments contribute to the extent of the impact? And perhaps most importantly, what can be done to make sure that the long-term welfare of survivors is considered?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/humanitarian-and-medical-aid-o.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Humanitarian and medical aid organised by Medecins Sans Frontieres is being loaded onto the Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, is currently assisting the French organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in delivering emergency relief aid. Greenpeace activists have been involved in the relief effort in India, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere since December 26. Although we are not an aid organisation, we felt this was the best way we could contribute most effectively. The Rainbow Warrior was already in the region and access to many of the most remote and isolated areas is only possible by ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Environmental impacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are also beginning to explore the possibilities of contributing to assessments of the environmental impacts caused by the tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial reports indicate that natural ecological systems such as coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands have suffered extensive impacts. Important research facilities for studying and monitoring these environments are reportedly also severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tsunami has highlighted the vulnerability of the sensitive marine environments, such as mangroves, that are the breeding grounds for many marine species and that represent the livelihood of thousands of communities that depend on them for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is undertaking a full environmental impact assessment of this natural disaster, and this, in conjunction with the various other initiatives underway, should lead to a good understanding of the scale and extent of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Redeveloping for the future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that healthy mangroves and coral reefs formed an essential defence against the tsunami. Damage appears to be much worse in areas where these natural defences were destroyed or degraded by shrimp farming and irresponsible coastal development for industry and tourism. Any recovery effort should ensure the conservation and restoration of these vital coastal ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the protection of human life in such an extreme event, but also considering the resilience of ecological systems, it is essential that redevelopment proceeds with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course right now we must give our efforts to those who have suffered in this tragedy. We have and will continue to offer support to MSF during the relief effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the most urgent needs are met, and the focus falls more clearly upon redevelopment and reconstruction, then we will contribute to recovery efforts to ensure that the approach to reconstruction addresses both short and longer term social and environmental needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bon Voyage</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bon-voyage-mercury-waste/</url><text>
	A container ship currently heading from southern India to the US represents a small victory in the fight against corporate crime across the globe. The ship is carrying 320 tonnes of toxic mercury contaminated waste which comes from a closed plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of consumer products giant Unilever.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/unilever-agrees-to-clean-up-it.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/unilever-agrees-to-clean-up-it.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unilever agrees to clean up its toxic mercury mess in south India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unilever mercury thermometer production plant was set up in TamilNadu, India in 1983 after being shipped wholesale from it previous location in New York State in the US. It is a classic tactic of the chemical industry to ship plants that are too dirty or inefficient for the US or Europe to areas such as India and extend their life where environmental and safety standards are lower. Hence the industry can continue to make profits from pollution for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Moving the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant at Kodaikanal imported mercury from the US and re-exported the thermometers back to the US. Mercury is a potent toxin affecting the nervous system of people and animals and a highly dangerous pollutant. Lax safety standards at the plant left workers with mercury poisoning and large amounts of mercury contaminated waste were dumped in the surrounding areas in complete disregard for the local communities by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local environmental groups and Greenpeace first exposed the mercury dumping scandal in May 2001. Subsequent protests by locals forced the closure of the plant but the contaminated waste was left littering the site and surrounding area. Investigations by the pollution control authorities revealed the pollution to be far worse than the company had admitted with soil contamination 600-800 the legal levels and approximately 17 times more mercury was unaccounted for than the company estimates. The authorities ordered the company to clean up the site and safely treat the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananthapadmanabhan, one of our campaigners in India, is studying the clean up: "We will be keeping a close watch on all future remedial actions by the company. Several thousand tonnes of toxic wastes and contaminated soil are still to be properly identified and contained. Now that the clean up has begun in earnest, compensation and health care for affected ex-workers should be immediately brought on to the agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste will be treated at a special plant in the US. The start of the clean up is a big victory for campaigners in India where other polluted hotspots cause by irresponsible companies, like Bhopal, abound.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mad Max is here</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Mad-Max-is-here/</url><text>
	We went on an expedition to see up close — and from above, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) — the real situation of the main reservoirs of the south-eastern Brazil. What we saw shows that the worst of the water crisis is yet to come.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" src="/international/Global/international/photos/forests/2015/mad-max-is-here.jpg" alt="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" width="800" height="532"&gt;Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: "Without Forests, There's No Water" © Greenpeace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out onto the "craquelure" bottom of a bone dry reservoir gives one a sinking feeling. Actually, the realization that we were not on the set of a post-apocalyptic film, like "Mad Max", but rather in the middle of an enormous reservoir that until just recently supplied millions of people with water, is enough to send anyone into despair. We were at the Serra Azul reservoir, in Minas Gerais, one of the main parts of the Paraopeba System, which ensures – or ensured – water for most of Greater Belo Horizonte and its 5.7 million inhabitants. Throughout the entire Paraopeba water basin, only 12% of the native forest remains. "Without vegetation on its banks, the reservoirs have a much more difficult time holding water since they suffer from erosion, pollution and silting," said Cristiane Mazzetti, a member of the Greenpeace Forest Campaign. "It's high time that our political leaders understood that, without the forest, there is no water."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot sun makes the thousands of cracks in the soil even more dramatic. After decades of being submerged, a bridge surfaces in the middle of the reservoir. The water that is left is concentrated at the bottom of the river channel. Way down at the bottom. At the moment, at the end of the rainy season in 2015, the Serra Azul is at around 9.10% of its capacity. In 2014, the average for the reservoir for the month of March was 44.3%. In other words, we are recording the lowest level in history for this reservoir for this time of the year. Our throats parched, we realized that we were witnessing an environmental collapse of enormous proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Serra Azul reservoir was the last stop on a six-day expedition to see some of the main reservoirs in Brazil's south-eastern region. Completed by Greenpeace at the beginning of April in partnership with the monitoring company Terra Sense, the objective of the expedition was to launch UAVs from different points along the reservoirs to record the level of water and the soil use of the surrounding areas. In all we traveled a thousand kilometers. We walked up hills, entered thickets, swampy plains and remote trails to access points that had been previously mapped as favourable for launching the UAV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="600" height="450" data="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157652279348729&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAVs, with their ability to capture aerial images precisely and quickly, make them an agile technological tool for research and other purposes. Without flying over any urban areas, our expedition was able to conduct 14 flights, with over four hours in the air, mapping 607 hectares in and around three reservoirs. Our efforts resulted in 668 photographs of the reservoirs and the surrounding area. When our expedition set off, we knew we would be the first to use UAV technology to monitor the state of reservoirs in Brazil. What we did not know was what we would witness with our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the Paraibuna reservoir, in Vale do Paraíba do Sul, at less than 5% of its capacity. This is at the end of the rainy season. In other words, it's not going to get any better. Just the opposite, the outlook for this year is frightening. During this same period last year (the beginning of April 2014), the Paraibuna was at 40% of its capacity. The Paraibuna, one of the most important for a system that supplies over eight million people in Rio de Janeiro, has less than 13% of the original forest in its water basin. Only 26% of its Permanent Preservation Areas, including hilltops and riversides, have been preserved. What one finds there is a lot of barren hillsides, pastures, silted riverbanks and, primarily in the region of the sources of the Paraibuna, in the upper Serra do Mar, rivers and springs that have run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Son, you see my cattle grazing over there? It was all water less than two years ago. Suddenly everything dried out," recalled Paulo Ribeiro da Silva, a milk producer who lives near the reservoir. Mr. da Silva explains that he grew up in the region and has never seen the water surface shrink this much. "If the government helped us to maintain the riverside forests and protect the springs, the situation would be different," he said. Even milk producers know that without the forest, there is no water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="A map of the Brazilian south-east" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg" alt="A map of the Brazilian south-east" width="600" height="609"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Paraíba do Sul basin the expedition traveled to the region that has become emblematic of the water crisis that affects the entire Brazilian south-east: the Cantareira System, the most important supply system for the largest metropolis in South America. Since mid-2014 pumping water from the so-called "dead volume," the Cantareira is a system of interlinked reservoirs that supply over five million people in Greater São Paulo. Or should we say supplied, since the state government has transferred part of that previously serviced by the Cantareira to other reservoirs in the wake of its collapse. From the edge of the reservoir or the top of the hills, we observed the Cantareira which is under capacity by 11% (without counting the "dead volume," which entered into use in May 2014). That's right, the level of the Cantareira stands at -11%. A year ago, this figure was around 14%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched the UAV from three different points at the Jaguari-Jacareí reservoir. For those who are concerned about the future of São Paulo, a warning: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/S0uUYiP1cLY"&gt;the images captured from above are dire.&lt;/a&gt; Only 15% of the forests of the basin are standing. Of the rivers that make up the basin, 76.5% are without their riparian forests. If the vegetation in the basin contributes to the water cycle on a regional scale and the riparian forests, in turn, protect rivers and springs from impacts like erosion and silting, our system is seriously degraded. "The economy of the region is already feeling the effects of the depletion of the reservoirs," said Marcelo Delduque, owner of the farm Fazenda Serrinha, located along the edge of the Jaguari-Jacareí. "A lot of people who depended on tourism and leisure activities have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0uUYiP1cLY?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the consequences of the water crisis go far beyond the economy. The collapse of the main reservoirs that supply the major cities of the south-east compromise the sustainability of the region, affecting the health, quality of life and survival of its population. The expedition increased the awareness that the south-east and other Brazilian regions have worked themselves into a corner and there is no magic solution. A fundamental step forward would be to stop deforestation now. "And begin to reforest, because this is the only way to recover the ability of the water basins to produce and store water," said Cristiane Mazzetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of millions of Brazilians depends on the recuperation of these reservoirs and on all of us to establish a new relationship with water resources and the forests. On a daily basis the Amazon releases 20 billion tons of water vapor into the atmosphere, forming flying rivers that flow to the south, south-east and mid-west regions of Brazil, irrigating fields and filling reservoirs. By continuing to deforest the Amazon and not recuperating the vegetation and the water basins that supply the country's major cities, Brazil is flirting with unprecedented socio-environmental disaster and compromising the future of new generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 1.1 million Brazilians have formed a movement to end deforestation in Brazil. We want to present the national congress with a bill that will prohibit new deforestation, protecting the forests that remain. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/amazon/"&gt;You can also join movement by signing the petition for Zero Deforestation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;

	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	As Barack Obama prepares to pick up a Peace Prize he's yet to earn, a truly deserving activist collects the Alternative Nobel Prize for his work to save the forests of the Congo.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>First faces of fortress Europe</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/First-faces-of-fortress-Europe/</url><text>
	It’s officially spring in the Northern Hemisphere but nobody seems to have told the weather gods in Lesbos. As 50-knot gusts of wind thump the island from the south, at least they bring welcome warm air and time to put some thoughts to paper.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTX_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the prevailing north wind that raises our guard as it puts the Turkish beaches in the lee and gives refugees the wrong impression of sea conditions further out on their perilous journey. It's a colder wind that brought snow and countless cases of hypothermia in the past. Beware the northerlies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, Greenpeace is wrapping up its refugee rescue operation on the Greek island of Lesbos and handing over to Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) who are ready to take full charge of the operation for the longer term. The last few weeks have been quiet with only the odd refugee boat managing to break through the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ"&gt;new dictate from Brussels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen off the winter and should be proud of it. Nearly 100 Greenpeace staff and volunteers have donated their time, skill and energy over the past five months in a spirit that can only be described as "old school". MSF and Greenpeace have acted as one throughout, and much of the handover is in name only as many of the hardened crew continue their work under a different badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTV_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up the last few months is a tricky task – no two days have been the same. It's easiest explained in numbers, but numbers fail dismally in this crisis of humanity, especially with politicians and media banding them around like a currency on the stock exchange. Numbers fail to describe the pictures etched into our minds: an outstretched hand, a semiconscious gaze or even the reassuring nod from a colleague as life and death decisions unfold amidst hysterical screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTQ_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF and Greenpeace assisted 18,117 people at sea between November 28, 2015 and March 23, 2016 and conducted 361 operations on the north coast of Lesbos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;141&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main categories of refugee boats. Neither is fit for purpose. Inflatables carry up to 70 people and come in variable quality, occasionally with the glue still sticky. ‘Wooden boats' describe any type of boat that isn't a rubber duck, and these are the most dangerous: they tend to capsize and sink quickly when they take on too much water, or break up as they hit the shore. Both types of boat are filled with petrified souls, but when the term ‘wooden boat' rings out over the VHF radio it quickens the pulse and hand to the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPJNV_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team up on the hill (call signs Romeo &amp;amp; Juliette) perform a dizzying array of tasks, from spotting and guiding refugee boats to relaying information between officials and non-governmental agencies responding on water and land. Here's a glimpse of what goes on behind the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore – 171 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a calm day this can be a happy affair. When the people in boats realise we are friend not foe, the singing can start. After all the hardship endured (one can only imagine) they are about to make it! Smiles emerge as we exchange the thumbs up sign and cultural mediators and medics begin to assess the condition of the new arrivals from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the stretch of coastline we cover, there are about a dozen safe landing beaches. We know them well now and I no longer need to refer to GPS coordinates as I radio an estimated time of arrival to Romeo/Juliette: "send the medics to Yogi or Chapel" or "ground support required at Aphrodite or Sheep Farm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it's just a case of tweaking their course, as they are not accustomed to sailing. Before today, many had never seen the sea, so they are not to know that a lighthouse signifies danger – and lives have been lost on the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV9_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other kinds of assistance (such as solving an engine problem) – 141 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Check the fuel, check the fuel and check the fuel again" is the phrase I remember from the ‘Beginners Guide to Outboard Maintenance and Troubleshooting'. How true in this case. Outboards don't run for long if the air valve on the tank is closed, the choke is out and 10 people are sitting on the fuel line. The lucky ones break down after they have crossed the Greek/Turkish border where help awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not authorised to cross the red dotted line on the GPS that signifies the border, so unless there's a "mayday" case, boats here are left to the mercy of the Turkish coastguard (we have seen some shocking footage). And I very much doubt if the refugees  get a refund from the smugglers. Anything up to 3,000 euros is paid per person, making it the most expensive six-nautical mile journey on the planet. Anywhere else and you could charter your own helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dead boat in the water is also highly exposed to the weather. Waves lap over the sides and people stacked in the middle get soaked (usually the most vulnerable – children, women and elderly). Getting the engine going again quickly is the best solution. Our cultural mediators (many of whom were once refugees themselves) are now well versed in Outboard Troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV8_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore with towing – 24 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting fails but the boat is still in reasonable condition, towing is the best solution. But first we must secure permission of the Hellenic Coast Guard – we do not want to risk being accused of ‘people smuggling'. It's a complex political game out on the water! There are many players to navigate: the EU border agency Frontex has Norwegian, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Swedish boats out there. Add to that NATO warships, Spanish lifeguards and German, Greek and Dutch volunteer boats ... the Greek Coast Guard has the final say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the practicalities of towing a rubber boat. Most have no reliable anchor points and there's a danger that you can pull them apart at the seams. The solution we've found is to put a thick towrope down the middle of the boat and ask the stronger people on board to hold tight with their bare hands. You won't find this technique in any RYA Manual of Seamanship but then you won't find this situation either. It works pretty well and is quick to deploy with the help of our interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHU4_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass MOB (man overboard) / MOB / capsizing / swamped / evacuation / transfer – 25 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the statistic that haunts our dreams at night. On 25 occasions many lives would have been lost had we not been on the scene. As it was, a total of four people died during our operations. Each occasion was different and the statistic covers a wide range of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter occasions it may be a swamped inflatable with a broken engine, but that could mean the kids in the middle were up to their necks, babies being held precariously aloft and hypothermia and panic in equal measure. The transfer of people from their boat to ours was rarely a calm affair. We'd do a co-ordinated sandwich manoeuvre with our two boats and try to offload the kids and babies first. We soon realised that it was important to take some mothers too as there is not much you can do with a baby in each arm! Sometimes outright panic would engulf the boat and a mad scramble would ensue. Often a stern word was required to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other occasions brought medical emergencies. There is a limit to how much medical treatment can be done during a rescue although we did carry oxygen and medical supplies. On one occasion the MSF medic successfully resuscitated a baby that had been in the water and had stopped breathing. On another we lost a four-year-old boy to the elements. Many arrived in the first, second and third stages of hypothermia so we would pull space blankets from our pockets like magicians. We were usually only a few miles to the nearest port and a waiting MSF ambulance, so in most cases the best option was to scoop up shivering children and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPI1R_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst incident was on December 16. Shortly after being threatened with arrest from Frontex (we are not allowed to patrol) a wooden boat capsized and sank. A total of 85 men, women, children and babies were in the water. We were the first responders to arrive, within 20 minutes. It was a scene from the Titanic. Death hung in the air. The Greenpeace boats were magnificent. Our crew grabbed, hauled and wrestled folks on-board, but still we lost two people that day. The Frontex boat couldn't do much as their freeboard was too high – they put out ropes instead! They don't threaten us with arrest any more and these days often request our assistance. I pray we never get another day like that, for everyone on the water it was traumatic, a day we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all these rescues it's the faces that we remember. Our contact with the refugees is intense, but it is over quickly. We check their pulses and breathing but there is no time for names or life stories. What happens to them after we deliver them ashore is not in our hands … I wish I knew more. Even if they make it to Germany or Sweden or wherever they want to go, I'm quite sure that many will grow up with a phobia of the sea, or perhaps it just blends into the multitude of horrific experiences they have had and continue to endure. Most are Syrians running from hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally as we start the process of packing for the journey home I find myself staring at my passport. How fortunate I am to have a bit of paper that allows me to fly over these man-made frontiers. An accident of birthplace. I feel privileged to have been the first face of Europe to many and hopefully a friendly one. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama first went to Copenhagen to support Chicago for the Olympics. How about going for a win this time around?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China leading, the US lagging - that's not quite the impression spin doctors from the White House were hoping to give when they finally released their numbers on emission reduction. Who is saying "Yes we can" now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of baselines and shallow commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin doctors were hard at work after the announcement - presenting this as a game changer. If you listened only to the White House, you could easily believe that Obama single-handedly saved the climate while everyone else stood around on the sidelines. The truth is, these are the numbers of the Waxman-Markey bill, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/strongmessage"&gt;which is not and has never been enough&lt;/a&gt; to really combat the devastating effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US keeps hiding behind weak numbers, made to appear stronger by shifting the "baseline" date to which they're compared. A reduction of 17 percent of 2005 levels is really a reduction of four or five percent of 1990 levels, the base year all other developed countries are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using 2005 as a base year is the kind of cheap math trick we expect from the Bush administration, not from a President who was elected promising he was going to get us out of the climate crisis. Moving the goal posts to pretend you're scoring is a nice way to spin your speeches, but science doesn't work that way. We can't change the science - we have to change the politics, which is not the way Obama is going right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep global temperature increases below two degrees, developed countries have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from the base year 1990. Anything less, and we face catastrophic climate change. The target of 40 percent emission reduction on a baseline of 1990 for industrialised countries is taken from the International Panel on Climate Change's scenario. This is not a political target, it is the minimum needed to keep the global average temperature at a safe level. You can't negotiate with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good efforts, but try harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, China, part of the group of developing country (the ones the Obama administration keeps insisting they're waiting for) offered targets that actually mean something to avoid catastrophic climate change - a reduction of carbon emissions relative to economic growth by 40 to 45 percent by 2020 also with a base year of 2005, though &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/news/china-carbon-intensity"&gt; those numbers are still not enough&lt;/a&gt;. "Given the urgency and magnitude of the climate change crisis, China needs stronger measures to tackle climate change," said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace China. "This is a significant announcement at a very important point in time. But China could do more."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By taking on a 40-45 percent carbon intensity target, China will have to take considerable efforts to decouple its economic growth from the increase in its carbon emissions. However, given the urgency of climate change, this target is not likely to accelerate China's clean energy revolution as quickly as it should be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barack to the future &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major announcement was made last week: &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/president_obama_will_go_to_cop.html"&gt; Barack Obama is planning on attending the Copenhagen summit... on December 9th&lt;/a&gt;. Last time he &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-shows-up-in-copenhagen021009/"&gt; showed up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, it was also a bit early, but as he is getting closer to the right date, we're keeping our fingers crossed for third time lucky. Otherwise we might start to worry about a possible break in the space-time continuum which could explain why Obama seems to be confusing 2005 with 1990, December 9th with December 17th and Washington, DC with Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Royal State dinner is organised in Copenhagen on the 17th, and it'd be such a shame for Obama to miss it.  Many heads of State have announced they will come already, and it hardly makes sense for Obama to miss the party. The last one to announce his presence was Silvio Berlusconi, adding to the long list of heads of state who have proved they take the threat of climate change remotely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wanted: Climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this, it appears that the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/our_work/guide-to-climate-politics/"&gt; climate leaders are not where you expect them to be&lt;/a&gt;. Obama, who had brought hope last year, is bringing nothing but disappointment in matters climatic. In the developed countries group, the EU has the best position, but it's still not enough. To find anyone leading the way, we have to look towards developing countries like Brazil, China, India, South Africa or Indonesia - or even better, towards the Maldives, the only country so far to pledge to go truly carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in the Obama camp now. Time to rise up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message with your Facebook profile picture or other image of your choice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck. 
&lt;div&gt;

            Parody of the logo of French nuclear fuel company, Areva, manufacturer of the steam generators aboard the Happy Ranger.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

	Facebook recently announced it will build a massive data centre in Oregon, U.S., packed full of the latest energy efficient computers to serve the hundreds of millions of friends connecting on their near-addictive social networking website. But the company plans to run the place on electricity made by burning coal--Yes, the dirtiest source of energy and largest single source of global warming pollution in the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Facebook.com shouldn't run on coal. Facebook should commit to renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should be run on 100 percent renewable energy. That clear demand started spreading &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coalfacebook"&gt;on the social network&lt;/a&gt; website this week, and will grow until the company announces a decision to really go green. The new data centre won't be ready until 2011, and people power has moved the company before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Facebook members have spoken strongly in the past on privacy and other changes that impact their profile pages, the company has been forced to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping coal from powering your profile page, big electricity consumers like Facebook can also play an important role by using its influence to demand policies that dramatically increase the supply of renewable electricity being put on the grid, so we can all use renewable energy--and not coal--to power the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook's relationship to coal: "It's not complicated"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PacifiCorp is the power company which Facebook chose to supply their new US$ 180 million data centre in Prineville, Oregon. &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.pacificorp.com/es/thermal.html" target="_new"&gt;PacifiCorp's website&lt;/a&gt;, over 83 percent of the utility's generation capabilities come from coal, geothermal, and natural gas resources.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; Pacific Power, whose parent company is PacifiCorp, gets almost 60 percent of its energy from burning coal.  Facebook also went to a state, Oregon, with only one existing in-state coal plant (that's shutting down within the decade) and instead decided to throw its lot with a utility that imports dirty coal from Wyoming, two states over.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Facebook says that the new building and all the technology within it will be state of the art, energy efficient stuff. Saving energy makes good business sense, and it's good for the environment too. But data centres still consume massive amounts of energy to run computers, backup power, and related cooling equipment. If Facebook's data centre runs on fossil fuels, then it's contributing to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should commit to stop using coal and choose renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. What's more, to be a climate leader Facebook should also push for strong clean energy and climate policies in the U.S. and globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which side are you on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data centres are heavy users of electricity. It's been a while since Facebook was run on a small computer in a Harvard University dorm. As the popularity of facebook.com continues to grow, so too will Facebook's need for more data centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies who run their data centres on energy from burning coal are supporting &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/"&gt; the biggest source of man made CO2 emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Our activists will continue to protest against coal-fired power plants. But getting companies like Facebook to switch to renewables is necessary for the energy revolution too -- reducing demand for coal, and investing in a green future instead.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our activists at the Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia have had an tough time lately. Many of them have been arrested, interrogated and deported - along with independent journalists. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Climate polluter gets suspended on the Kampar Peninsula 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point police even tried to shut down the entire camp. Yet thanks to local support, our camp continues, in the heart of the rainforest, with the spirit and resolve of those remaining now stronger than ever as we celebrate a first positive step resulting from our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Ministry of Forestry has suspended the operation of Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL) on the Kampar Peninsula- pending an investigation into their permits. &lt;a id="lg:w" title="This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. And as local authorities do their best to silence us we're witnessing adramatic growth in both local and international support to protect forests for the climate in Indonesia - and across the globe &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/18/AR2009111804162_2.html?sid=ST2009111804211"&gt; Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CA8QFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F93fbcc6e-d467-11de-a935-00144feabdc0.html&amp;amp;ei=r1kFS5TiKt6TjAeTtJC8Cw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEPQqb_lclJBLo0Nj5JTKdlEisBCg&amp;amp;sig2=mpO8ZC6yVXD5KWueKZpWyQ"&gt; Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1940544,00.html"&gt; TIME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/11/indonesia-deports-palm-oil-activists-journalists.php"&gt; Treehugger&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action to defend the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="nbz_" title="50 brave activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;50 activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; - and as a result many were arrested, intensively interrogated and 11 foreigners were deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the Indonesian police gave the camp an eviction order. After a 24 hour reprieve, secured by our team on the ground, 300 members of the local community arrived at the camp to show us their overwhelming support - forcing the Chief of Police to reverse his decision to close us down. &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/here_is_an_update_from.html"&gt; Our Deputy Program Director, Sarah Burton, was at the camp&lt;/a&gt; to express our global commitment to stop deforestation and thank the local community members for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the police have arrested, detained and deported two more campaigners from Italy and Belgium and two journalists who were on their way to the camp with us from India and Italy. But the local community have demonstrated their support once again and our camp remains active thanks to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;National support culminates in Jakarta rally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a id="me-q" title="more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/en/news/callsby-climateaction"&gt;more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. They unfolded a banner reading, "Stop talking, start acting - save the forests for our future".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Pittsburgh G20 Summit earlier this year, President Yudhoyono made an international commitment to a 41 percent reduction in carbon emissions if this was supported with international money. This commitment also needs to be matched by developed countries making deep emissions cuts at home. And they need to support forested countries like Indonesia by committing to a fund to protect tropical forests. &lt;a id="v2kc" title="Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Worldwide support for forest protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the detainment and deportation of our Italian campaigner and an independent Italian journalist, Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs put out its strongest ever statement on the importance of tackling forest destruction, responsible for about a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions. That led to Italian supermarket chain, the Co-Op, writing toits suppliers demanding that they stop any dealings with companies linked to Indonesian rainforest destruction. Meanwhile - &lt;a href="http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/09_novembre_20/greenpeace_oranghi_berlusconi-1602036849795.shtml"&gt; in Rome an orangutan family of climate refugees sent a message to President Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; asking him to "Cut CO2 not forests". Back in Indonesia, our team unfurled a banner in a deforested area in Indonesia to send the same message to the President from the frontline of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.ch/index.php?id=1335"&gt;Switzerland - homeless orang-utans stole the show outside key Government ministries&lt;/a&gt;in the capital - they camped out in trees outside government buildings all night to bring the issue to the attention of the Swiss Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, was urged to seek a strong agreement in Copenhagen next month as wishes were placed in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeace_nederland/sets/72157622710110113/show/"&gt; thousands of shoes which were positioned in The Hague's center square by Dutch Greenpeace volunteers&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, children throughout The Netherlands leave shoes out for Sinterklaas (The Dutch version of Santa Claus) and expect something in return. This year - we're asking for a good deal in Copenhagen, including a forest fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;All roads lead to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, making it one of the roots of the climate crisis. We will only avert this crisis if Obama, Merkel, Sarkozy, Brown and other world leaders commit to much deeper cuts in emissions from fossil fuels and to provide the critical funds needed so that countries like Indonesia can end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they fail, we will face mass extinctions, floods, droughts and famine before the end of the century. The climate deal is expected to include a new scheme to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), which will provide the funds needed for nations such as Brazil and Indonesia to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a million hectares of forest, mostly tropical rainforest, are destroyed every month - that is an area of forest the size of a football pitch every two seconds. Indonesia has become the world's third largest climate polluter, after China and the US, since it emits such huge quantities of CO2 - mostly from forest and peatland destruction. The peatland forest on the Kampar Peninsula forms part of one of the largest natural carbon "sinks" in the world and is home to rare species including orangutan and the Sumatran tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up our Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia last month to bring urgent attention to the role that rainforest and peatland destruction play in driving dangerous climate change in the run-up to the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) and its main rival APRIL are key drivers of rainforest and peatland destruction on the Kampar Peninsula. We hope the Indonesian authorities stop intimidating peaceful protestors who are trying to help President Yudhoyono fulfill the commitment he has made to cut Indonesia's massive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions - and instead continue to investigate companies like APRIL that are destroying the forest and driving global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s been almost two years since the wrongful arrest of Junichi and Toru for their roles in exposing the corruption and lies woven in the fabric that holds the whaling industry together. As the trial for those charges began, it seemed obvious to all in attendance that the case the prosecution put together is cut from the same cloth.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Tokyo Two on the opening day of the trial where whaling will also be judged in Aomori, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial opened up with the prosecution struggling to prove its own arguments and their witnesses being forced to agree with the defence on key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Japan maintains that whaling is conducted as "scientific research" and paid for with Japanese taxes, the everyday business of killing and processing whales falls to one commercial company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness from this company and from the courier company used to ferry the embezzled meat around the country  were in court to testify about what it looks like when whale meat and money change hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the story seemed to change quite a bit from original claims, one thing was for sure - it had nothing to do with research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not so "official" business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of sales for Kyodo Senpaku - the company contracted by the government's Institute for Cetacean Research, to run the whaling fleet - admitted under cross examination that "souvenirs" of whale meat were given to crew, but the cost was never accounted for in financial statements, despite the whaling programme being a government funded project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same official that previously made public statements where he insisted that there was no practice of giving out souvenir meat. He also admitted under oath that following the Greenpeace allegations in 2008, souvenirs are no longer given to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prosecution also called the manager of the Seino Transport courier company, which shipped the boxes of embezzled whale meat around Japan in April 2008 after the fleet returned from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. In his testimony he confirmed that he had paid the owner of the box about 30,000 yen (US$300) out of his own pocket, and never registered this payment. He also admitted that the owner had told him the box contained food and not the "cardboard" listed on the contents sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was madeby the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedythe shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will befair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it shouldre-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt; the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen hestood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Nowhe has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, byensuring that corruption is put on trial - rather than the honourablemen who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Dr Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 12th, 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister Hatoyama,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your election has presented Japan with a-once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change. Internationally, your support for ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions has challenged the world to put our climate before corporate profits, the stance of a true leader. At home, your election commitment to build a strong economy and end corruption within the government has given you much support with the people of Japan, but also presents a hard road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us came to our new roles around the same time last year and I believe we have much common ground on which to build a new relationship between government and non-government organisations in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Greenpeace I worked for many years to end corruption in my home country of South Africa, to end poverty worldwide and to ensure that all human rights are respected. When our voices were in the minority, change was hard won. I can imagine that you must have felt the same, fighting to change the political landscape of a generation.  It is an incredible achievement to have turned the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accepted the role of International Executive Director at Greenpeace, because I believe that ensuring a green and peaceful planet is also a basic human right. For both of us, it is not enough to say we want change, we must ensure it happens and now we are both in a position to do so.  Turning the tide is not enough, a new  course must also be set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has operated in Japan for twenty years. In that time our actions stopped the dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan; we have worked with local communities to stop the expansion of US airbases that risked the habitat of the threatened dugong; developed long term working relationships with the technology industry in Japan to remove dangerous substances from products such as mobile phones and computers. We have contributed to government debates to ensure that corporations promoting genetically engineered food do not gain a foothold in Japan and we have not only raised concerns and debate about the nuclear threat in Japan, but assisted in monitoring for radiation following the 2007 fire at the Kashiwazaki nuclear reactor, after a major earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long, positive, peaceful history in your country. However, as a new member of Greenpeace, I can say that I suspect all we are recognised for is our opposition to whaling. Greenpeace in Japan and the Liberal Democratic Party have been at loggerheads on this one issue for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 15th in Aomori, the trial begins of Greenpeace Japan's senior executive Junichi Sato and his colleague Toru Suzuki, following their exposure of large scale corruption within the government whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has garnered a large amount of international attention and condemnation. More than a quarter of a million people sent emails requesting that the government investigate the allegations of corruption and not prosecute the activists. Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams have also signed on to a letter calling on Japan to adhere to strict international standards on human rights. Many international organisations including Transparency International and Amnesty International registered their concern about the manner of detention and prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, just last week, Greenpeace received notification that the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that, in pursuing the detention and prosecution of Junichi and Toru, the previous Administration in Japan had breached numerous articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are decisions made not on your watch. The many years of claim and counter claim were with another party. The United Nations ruling was against the decisions of the previous Administration. You were swept to power on a wave of hope because the people of Japan were tired of corruption. I believe in the same way that you have shown strength in challenging other governments to reach further in the climate negotiations, that you will also take the lead in showing other governments that the civil and political rights of its citizens are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is watching this trial, I urge you to show that it will both be fair and conducted in full accordance with you international obligations to protecting human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are rights that I have held in my heart since I was a child growing up in South Africa under Apartheid, and ones that I will always strive for, but in my new life at Greenpeace there is an equally compelling need to act to stop climate change and I believe we can also work together to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the biggest threat our planet and people face and demands immediate, dramatic action. I know that Japan can go even further if other nations will make similarly strong commitments and I welcome the chance to discuss how we can face this challenge together, and in particular exchange opinion on how Japan can continue to take a leadership role regarding climate finance. I also know that nuclear is not the answer - we have only to look at the dangers of the technology, the needless expense and most tangibly, the radiation leaks at Kashiwazaki after the earthquake to know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are solutions. Greenpeace has already mapped out and had accepted by scientists a plan for an Energy [R]evolution which outlines a global plan for a sustainable renewable economic future. It shows us how we can get from where we are now, to where we need to be to avoid a climate change disaster. It was developed with specialists from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Centre and more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that together we can forge a new relationship in Japan. That you will ensure human rights are respected and the environment protected and it is my strongest hope that the opportunities presented to both of us will be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/08be9eab86664205b6c2569cb5b36d0a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join Kumi. Tell the Japanese government that you stand beside Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;To preserve our independence, we don't take funds from governments or corporations. You are the reason we can do what we do.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	When two of our activists were detained after exposing major corruption in the Japanese whaling industry -- we knew the Japanese authorities breached internationally guaranteed human rights. Now, as these two activists prepare to take the stand and have their day, or more in court, the violation of their human rights has been confirmed by a UN working group.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;"Tokyo Two"&lt;/a&gt;, are due to stand trial on February 15th -- charged for theft and trespass. But over the past two years it has become clear that &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/timeline/"&gt;much more is now under the legal spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. Corrupt government practices, censoring public information, Japan'sadherence to international law, freedom of speech and the right ofindividual protest together with the commercial killing of thousands of whales are all under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before the verdict has evenbeen rendered, a working group of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has already ruled that, in the defendants' attempts to expose a scandal in the public interest, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two/wgad-opinion"&gt;their human rights have been breached by the Japanese justice system&lt;/a&gt;. The Working Group's opinion is the first of its kind for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/End-whaling-NOW/"&gt;Take Action: Stand beside Junichi and Toru as co-defendants and show theJapanese government that it cannot silence the opposition to whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; February 12th, Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams, along with several top celebrties, have added their support for Junichi and Toru. And our Executive Director Kumi Naidoo has written &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt;an open letter to Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/the-japanese-whaling-ship-niss.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="151"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Junichi and Toru exposed a scandal involving government corruption entrenched within the tax-payer funded whaling industry. Their findings included the embezzlement of whale meat. The Tokyo District Prosecutor began an investigation but then shut it down the same day that &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;Junichi and Toru were arrested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were held for 26 days, 23 of them without charge - often tied to chairs while they were interrogated, without a lawyer present. They face up to ten years in jail for doing what any honorable citizen should do -- expose corruption. But it is not just Junichi and Toru's liberty that is at stake here -- it is the fundamental right to peacefully investigate and expose corruption, to challenge authority and to do so without fear of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their initial arrest in June 2008, more than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition to demand justice for the Tokyo Two, and legal experts including Supreme Court advocates worldwide have expressed concern about the prosecution. &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/tokyo-two-statement-of-concer/"&gt;International human rights and advocacy groups such as Amnesty International have questioned the legitimacy of the prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A hugely significant UN ruling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNHRC's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention informed the Japanese government in December that its treatment of Junichi and Toru breached no fewer than five articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The working group also recognised the following facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Sato and Suzuki acted considering that their actions were in the greater public interest as they sought to expose criminal embezzlement within the taxpayer-funded whaling industry."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Junichi and Toru willingly cooperated with the police and the Public Prosecutor but that this cooperation was not acknowledged."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The Government did not submit any essential information, such as details of Junichi ans Toru's activities as environmental activists, the investigation they carried out, the evidence they gathered or the help they gave to authorities to formally investigate their allegations."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time anyone has been found to be arbitrarily detained in Japan, so even before it has officially begun this case has become a landmark," said Dr Naidoo. "Prime Minister Hatoyama's government has shown itself to be a leader when it comes to climate change, now it is time for it to show its commitment to human rightsand ensure this case is remembered as a progressive turning point for justice in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;--&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt; Open letter to Prime Minister Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt; from Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr. Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Working Group concluded: "The right of these two environmental activists not to be arbitrarily deprived of their liberty; their rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to exercise legitimate activities, as well as their right to engage in peaceful activities without intimidation or harassment has not been respected by the Justice system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the Working Group found that the government has contravened articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also took the view that Sato and Suzuki had been denied the right to challenge their detention before an independent and impartial tribunal in fair proceedings, and requested that the remainder of the trial be conducted fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/greenpeace-staff-junichi-sato.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="244"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato (left), Toru Suzuki (right), and their leadcounsel, Yuichi Kaido (centre) face reporters at a press briefing following their first pre-trial hearing at Aomori District Court in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was made by the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedy the shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will be fair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it should re-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt;the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen he stood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Now he has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, by ensuring that corruption is put on trial -- rather than the honourable men who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

	Since December there has been a glut of stories challenging the science of climate change as represented by the IPCC. Should we be concerned? Only about climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Arctic sea ice: still melting. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately there's been a rash of stories all ending with the word "gate" and all questioning the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the IPCC. Here's our handy guide to the truth behind the gates, but first -- why are they all called 'gate' anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Watergate" scandal of the early 1970s brought down US President Nixon, and was so named because it began with a break-in at the Watergate Hotel, Washington DC. After Nixon's resignation the conservative columnist and former Nixon speechwriter William Safire began attaching the word ''gate'' to all kinds of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactic worked, and pretty soon you could make anything sound like a scandal by adding the word "gate". Why did he do it? Partly to make his former boss's crimes look less serious and partly to make the small stories he was writing about look bigger than they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what's been going on in the last two months. The recipe is simple. Take a small story, add the word "gate", a dash of alarmism, and pinch of exaggeration and voila, instant scandal. Oh, and repeat as frequently as you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the breakdown on what's been happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Hackergate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate began with the release onto the internet of around one thousand e-mails and three thousand documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, home to some well respected climate scientists. With a thousand e-mails to choose from, a handful of sentences were selected to try and make the case that something dodgy was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video spells out quite nicely how much substance there was to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; 
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nnVQ2fROOg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;
&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nnVQ2fROOg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Himalayagate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate was followed by Himalayagate. In its Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, the IPCC reported that Himalayan Glaciers could be gone as soon as 2035. That claim turned out to be incorrect, and not to have been based on a scientific study. The IPCC subsequently withdrew the claim, it was an error, not a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean the glaciers aren't retreating, just that the rate of retreat isn't as high as the IPCC stated. On the graph below from the World Glacier Monitoring Service the red bars are years where, on average, the world's glaciers shrank, blue are years where they grew. Are the world's glaciers in trouble? It's an easy question. Is there more red or blue on the graph below?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/sum08.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24928/graph-showing-the-mean-annual.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Amazongate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Himalayagate we had Amazongate. Here the charge was that the footnote to the claim that 40% of the Amazon could die off was wrong. Not that the claim was wrong, just that the footnote was wrong. And it was. The report  the footnote pointed to didn't back up the claim directly itself. But  another scientific paper did [1]. Since then two more papers [2, 3] have confirmed the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's bad footnoting, but it's not bad science, and that's all there was to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The Mini Ice Age Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Northern Europe, or North East America you've had a cold start to 2010. And since that's where a lot of journalists live several of them have taken the opportunity to join up the collection of 'gates' with the cold weather to claim that there's a mini ice age coming. If that sounds a little hysterical to you, well, you'd be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story didn't really run in Australia though, because they're suffering from near record high summer temperatures. The West coast of Canada didn't pick it up either, because things are so warm that they're having to move snow by hand to make sure the Winter Olympics can go ahead as planned. Meanwhile in the high Arctic the weather seems warmer than usual. Indeed, it's the warm Arctic that's causing the current cold weather in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most newspapers provide their journalists with access to the internet. Why so few of them used it when compiling their 'mini ice age' stories is something we may never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;So what drives this debate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From reading the mainstream media, you might think there's a battle of opinion going on in the scientific community. Nothing could be further from the truth. The scientific consensus represented by the IPCC's reports is robust. Scientists who are sceptical about 'anthropogenic global warming' (AGW) are so thin on the ground, for instance, that the BBC's environmental analyst, Roger Harrabin, &lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/02/03/bbc-asks-wuwt-for-help/#more-15999"&gt; e-mailed a climate-denier blog&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February, for help in finding one! He wrote, "I am trying to talk to UK scientists in current academic posts who are sceptical about AGW. I'm struggling to find anyone..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inaccurate claim recently going around was that the IPCC's conclusion that coral reef degradation is linked to climate change was solely based on a report by Greenpeace. In fact, the IPCC's findings are solidly underpinned by peer-reviewed science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recurring story over the past 20 years of the IPCC. Attacks against the IPCC have originated from hired guns of the fossil fuel industry or disgruntled individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What this means for the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPCC scientific assessment is a rigorous and robust process, probably the biggest ever organised scientific endeavour, with thousands of scientists in many different research institutes around the world, backed up with masses of data. It is also a human endeavour and therefore not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment report in question is 3,000 pages long, and so far two years of effort by the world's denialists and journalists have found, well, one bad footnote. The story about the Himalayas was pointed out by a scientist - just the way it was supposed to be, and since we, like many others, relied on the IPCC report and repeated it we're now correcting it across our websites. If you spot any examples we've missed, &lt;a href="/international/en/about/contactus/"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has, and continues to have confidence in the IPCC. There is no more reliable guide to the world's climate science than the IPCC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7014203.ece"&gt; reported in the Times&lt;/a&gt; that the Executive Director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, has called for the resignation of the IPCC chair, Dr Rejendra Pachauri. His comments were taken from a much longer conversation with the Times journalist at a reception and do not reflect the full conversation. Greenpeace is not calling for Pachuari to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is clear, climate change is real, is happening now, and is caused by people. The solution is still in our hands, with clean energy, smart use of our power, and forest protection. If you want to be part of that solution, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt; become a climate defender today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Toxics Action Delivering E-Waste to Wipro 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of India's relatively small PC manufacturing companies, &lt;a href="http://www.wipro.com/corporate/media/newsdetail.aspx?id=1562" target="_blank"&gt;Wipro, has beaten giants like Dell, Samsung and Lenovo to the finish line&lt;/a&gt; in producing a computer free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major first in India, the announcement marks another success for our green electronics campaign in driving tech companies around the world to clean up their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new computer, named "Greenware" is free of both hazardous PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and BFRs (brominated flame retardants). This meets a long-time demand of Greenpeace. Since 2005, we have been encouraging a greener electronics race by ranking company performance. Wipro joins companies like &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Apple, HP and Nokia who are leading the way on eliminating toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.  Years of pressure from Greenpeace, and attention to our ranking from green consumers, are driving more and more companies to clean up their act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 is the year many electronics companies pledged to remove toxic chemicals like PVC and BFRs. Those that took this pledge seriously are now delivering. Other companies that are far bigger than Wipro in the global market -- such as Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung -- are failing to come up with the green goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our latest ranking, Samsung lost points for failing to give a clear timeline for removing toxic chemicals, as did Dell and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;E-waste in Asia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste are exposed to significant health risks, as are nearby communities. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources can form dangerous dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic waste is a particular concern in Asia, as a lot of the waste produced in developed countries ends up there for crude recycling, though a better word for it would probably be "dumping." Poor regulations and control enable a traffic that is essentially illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste exposes unprotected workers, many of them children, to toxic chemicals. It is time for all tech companies to follow the example set by Wipro and other leaders and produce electronics free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	Industries pumping out poisonous substances day after day into rivers that entire communities rely on for their basic water needs - the reality of water pollution in China is one of the country's biggest tragedies. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/outflow-pipe-in-pearl-river-de.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace campaigner takes a waste water sample directly from the outflow pipe of the Qingyuan Top Dragon Textile company.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context even a seemingly small step by the Government to blacklist 20 factories in the Guangdong province for failing to meet water discharge standards, is of great significance. Three of the factories on the blacklist were amongst those found to be releasing hazardous chemicals as part of their wastewater discharge in our &lt;a title="poisoning the pearl" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Greenpeace collected and analysed samples of wastewater discharges and sediments from five industrial sites located throughout the Guangdong province that has the Pearl River running through it and is known as the "world's factory floor", accounting for nearly 30 percent of China's exports in 2007. The subsequent results of the sampling and analysis were released in a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/hazardous-chemical-pollution-o/"&gt; scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Warning for blacklisted companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the five factories that we sampled, three have been put on the government blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true extent of this pollution is still an unknown. A problem further exacerbated by inadequate water pollution regulation, allowing factories to discharge wastewaters containing complex cocktails of chemicals capable of causing serious damage to China's rivers and the life in and around them. Detailed report on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt; Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being blacklisted means greater scrutiny on these companies and their industrial discharges which could in the future translate to deadlines by the government for the companies to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/"&gt; stop polluting the Pearl River Delta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a warning to the factories and it may also affect the company's financial status in terms of ability to launch a stock market listing or apply for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;We welcome the decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government started publishing these lists in 2006 and the important thing to notice is that factories previously blacklisted have improved their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome both the list and the fact that three of the companies we highlighted to the government last year have been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those three companies are Qingyuan Top Dragon, Wing Fung P.C. Board, and Techwise Qingyuan Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;However a final note of caution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since China's pollution regulations focus largely on conventional pollutants and not toxic chemicals, Greenpeace is urging the government to urgently rework this legislation. The blacklisting is a positive first step, but to seriously combat pollution that causes cancer and sickness, China needs to start monitoring and eliminating hazardous chemical discharges into its rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
