	According to conventional wisdom (oh all right the tabloid press to be more precise) all teenagers ever think about are themselves. So it may come as a surprise that a global survey of almost 50,000 teens released today reveals that they have many other concerns - and that they worry more about dangerous greenhouse gases than drugs, violence or war.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Habbo against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As governments meet in Bali to thrash out a coordinated response
to the challenge of climate change, 74 per cent of those polled
through the online Habbo community see it as a serious problem. In
fact, 56 per cent see it as the greatest threat facing the world
today, even greater than terrorism (46 per cent). And they think
that governments which are more concerned about terrorism than
climate change have got things the wrong way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of those polled believe climate change will have a
negative effect on their lives. And who do they think is
responsible? North America comes in for the strongest criticism,
with 39 per cent of teens citing the continent as the source of the
majority of greenhouse gases, followed by Europe (24 per cent) and
Asia (19 per cent). Despite teens in every country pointing fingers
at North America for the crisis (except in Asia where they blame
themselves), a quarter of North American teens are still not sure
if global warming is even a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the up side, 64 per cent believe that we can control global
warming, provided that we act now. Many are planning to promote &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action/"&gt;
Saturday's climate day of action&lt;/a&gt; by holding events and
demonstrations within their virual communities. They see themselves
as 'Generation C' - the generation who will have to bear the brunt
of dealing with climate change over the coming decades. And their
message to the Bali negotiators is clear - there is no more
important challenge facing mankind than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that this message, together with the many others
flooding in to Bali from around the world, will get through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;About the survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted within the virtual world, Habbo, and
the total amount of respondents (after data cleaning) was 49,243.
The research was conducted in November 2007. 18 countries were
surveyed and statistical weighting was employed to give all
participating countries an equal weight in the global results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;About Habbo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habbo is a richly colorful, multi-dimensional virtual community
and game environment for teens. Users join by creating a
fully-customized online character called a Habbo. From there, they
can explore many public hang-outs, play a variety of games, connect
with friends, decorate their own rooms, and have fun through
creativity and self expression. Currently there are Habbo
communities in 31 countries on five continents. To date, over 82
million Habbo characters have been created and 6 million unique
users worldwide visit Habbo each month (source: Google
Analytics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your Habbo group&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2007/12/kids_in_virtual_world_call_out.html#more?MM_URL=habbo"&gt;Habbo is a virtual community for teens. There are already 16 Habbos against climate change groups.

	The Japanese whaling fleet has delayed its departure to the Southern Ocean for its annual whale hunt to avoid political embarrassment when Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda meets with US President George W. Bush.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists hold a banner with an question mark  beside the Nisshin Maru 'Research' factory ship,  demonstrating the fake nature of the whaling operation. Greenpeace is using every peaceful available means to bring the hunt to an early end and make it the last time the Sanctuary is breached by the whalers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's annual Southern Ocean whale hunt is conducted under the
guise of science but has been condemned internationally. This
season, Japan aims to kill more than 1,000 whales, including 50
endangered fin whales and, for the first time in 20 years, 50
threatened humpback whales will also be harpooned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Whaling Commission has called for an end to
the killing of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary under
Japan's whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship the Esperanza is currently positioned just outside
Japanese territorial waters and will be following the Japanese
whaling fleet after it leaves the port of Shimonseki for its
passage towards the Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese government's 'scientific' whaling programme is a
sham and a source of diplomatic tension between Japan and countries
that support whale conservation, like the United States. Whaling
has no place in Antarctica - it's a place of peace and science, and
this is not science," said Karli Thomas, expedition leader aboard
the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll carried out in Japan by the Nippon Research
Centre, in June 2006, showed that 95 per cent of Japanese people
never or rarely eat whale meat. More than two-thirds of Japanese do
not support whaling on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/16/2093101.htm"&gt;Another
study&lt;/a&gt; recently conducted by Julia Bowett, a PhD student from
the University of Tasmania, found that among Japanese students
approximately 65 percent agreed with the view that scientific
research on whales should only use non-lethal methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that you don't need to kill whales for research,
Greenpeace is collaborating with a team of scientists on the '&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt;' project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from satellite tagging of whales, harmless skin biopsies
and fluke identification has already yielded valuable information
about the migration patterns of threatened humpback populations,
without a single harpoon being fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/map/"&gt;
display the location&lt;/a&gt; of the whaling fleet as it is tracked
south by the Esperanza on the same map on which it is tracking
humpback migration routes from their breeding grounds in New
Caledonia and the Cook Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan's whalers are deceiving the Japanese public by painting
the word 'research' on their ships," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace
Japan Whales Project leader. "Real scientists don't need to kill
whales to study them. This is commercial whaling poorly dressed up
as science."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese Government should already know that information
about whales can be gained without killing them. The Antarctic
whale hunt is an expensive waste of Japanese taxpayers' money and
goes against public opinion in Japan and overseas. The time has
come for the Japanese government to end this hunt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has close to 4,000 tons of whale meat from its
'scientific' whaling programme in cold storage - uneaten, unsold,
and unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/great-whale-trail/profiles/whalemail?MM_URL=whalefleethiding"&gt;Get your Free Whale Mail delivered straight to your inbox with all the latest news about our how you can help defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org/visitor/index.php?event_id=main"&gt;You can create your own fundraising page to help end whaling in the Southern Ocean forever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace USA's "Project Hot Seat" campaign aims to get a pro-climate protection majority in the US Congress. Greenpeace activists and grassroots groups are urging Congressmen and women across America, to sign up to the Safe Climate Act. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/wind-turbine-crop-circle.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/wind-turbine-crop-circle.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Wind turbine crop circle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Act is a scientifically based solution that would by 2050;
reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent compared to
1990 levels. This is urgently needed to stop climate change
spiralling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reductions may seem like a big ask, but luckily we have the
solution - investment in renewable energy technologies, and massive
improvements in the ways we use energy, make the goals entirely
plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Crop circle boosts campaign &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign had a great boost this week, when Congressman Dave
Loebsack in Iowa changed his mind and agreed to sign up to the Act.
He had previously told Greenpeace that though he was concerned
about global warming, he would be unable to commit to the Safe
Climate Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Greenpeace and local grassroots groups created a very clear
message, a crop circle of a wind turbine in an Iowan cornfield. The
demand was simple "Congress: deliver renewable energy solutions to
climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked, Loebsack signed the very next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on Iowa to have at least 20 per cent of
its energy come from renewable technologies by 2020. This alone
would create 5,080 jobs, one and half times more than generating
electricity from fossil fuels does. Consumers would save a massive
$400 million (US) in lower electricity and natural gas bills, and
the greenhouse gas emission reductions would equal a massive 71
million cars off the road.  &lt;span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'&gt;Hopefully, Loebsack colleague, Representative LeonardBoswell, will soon follow suit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kelly Mitchell from Greenpeace USA put it "the solutions to
global warming are right here in the fields of Iowa."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dutch court rules that term "clean coal" is misleading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Greenpeace Netherlands had a court victory this week,
when the Dutch Advertising Authority (ACA) ruled that use of terms
such as "clean coal" and "clean fuel" by Dutch energy giant NUON
are "misleading."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NUON must now stop using "clean coal" in its print and web
adverts. The ruling shows that "clean coal" is a contradiction in
terms and that aggressive marketing of it is nothing more than a
desperate attempt by the coal industry to make itself relevant in
the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join project hot seat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/action/start.php?action_id=145"&gt;Help get the Safe Climate Act passed by the US Congress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=hot-seat"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	The forests of Argentina are being cleared at a rate of 40 football fields every hour. To stop the destruction we took to the trees - and to the streets. While our activists protested in the forest, we joined forces with other environmental groups, got 1.5 million signatures of support and pushed through Argentina's first federal forest protection law.

            Demonstration at the National Congress to demand the Forest Law.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law includes a nationwide one-year moratorium on
clearing of native forests - to avoid a rush of deforestation while
forest management regulations are put in place. After a year, any
jurisdiction still lacking regulations will continue to be
prohibited from issuing new logging and land clearing permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Law also establishes environmental impact studies and
public hearings - measures that will help protect forests where
indigenous people live and small scale farmers.  To pay for
implementation, the law allocates funds from the national budget,
plus income from a new export tax on genetically engineered
soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest clearing to plant genetically engineered soy beans
destroys 300,000 hectares of native forest per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Without those 1,500,000 signatures and the thousands of phone
calls which the senators received, this law would never have been
approved," said Hernan Giardini, Forest Campaign Coordinator for
Greenpeace Argentina. "It is a real victory for the people and for
the entire country."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we are only waiting for the approval of Congress, which we
believe will happen before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  On 28 November 2007, the bill was approved and became law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=arg-forest-victory"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Seven years to save the Amazon</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Amazon-7-years070904/</url><text>
	Seven years? It's a tall order but we have a cunning plan. Together with eight other national campaigning organisations, our Brazilian team have launched an ambitious proposal with a goal of zero deforestation by 2015.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/aerial-view-of-the-rainforest.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Aerial view of the rainforest during the burning season in the Amazon, photographed during a flight from Itaituba to Alta Floresta.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-deforestation-agreement/"&gt; The plan&lt;/a&gt;, published yesterday, sets out specific targets that could see deforestation drop gradually over the next seven years, pushing for a cut of 25 percent in the first year compared to figures for 2005/6. It's thinking on a massive scale, but we believe it can be done - with deforestation rates already falling and with a concerted effort it really could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the proposal contains a few key elements, none of which are particularly radical but together with tough reduction targets add up to a powerful package. One is to create financial incentives that promote forest protection rather than forest destruction, so everyone is encouraged to make use of the forest in a truly responsible manner than has been the case up until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object id="amazonfires-slideshow" width="430" height="311" data="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="data" value="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25283/amazonfires.swf"&gt;
&lt;param name="name" value="amazonfires-slideshow"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another central plank of the proposal is to beef up the forest protection agencies so there is a hugely increased presence of state and government officials. With increased resources, they'll be able to monitor, control and inspect commercial activities properly to prevent illegal logging and land clearance for farming. One of the major challenges is to ensure that zero deforestation is achieved while still guaranteeing the social-rights of indigenous and local communities who live in and around the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is going to be possible without full involvement from the government and companies, but at least they're listening. Present at the launch in Brasilia today were Minister of Environment Marina Silva and the governors of several Amazon states, including Blario Maggi. As well as being governor of Mato Grosso, he is also the head of Grupo Amaggi, a major soya exporter and signatory too the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/mcvictory"&gt;two-year soya moratorium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's a price tag for all this - an estimated one billion reais (over 384 million euros). Weighed against the value of the rain forest in terms of biodiversity and the livelihoods of the people who depend on it, it looks like small change, particularly when it includes international contributions. Because, given the rainforest's role in moderating climate change, it's something we all have an interest in preserving: up to one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions are down to deforestation, making Brazil the fourth largest polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol begin this December in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, and we want to see deforestation included in the discussions. If that happens, responsibility for forest protection won't fall just on forest nations, and rich countries will need to contribute as well. For daring zero deforestation proposals like this one to work, international co-operation is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;

	The latest edition of our quarterly Guide to Greener Electronics assesses for the first time TVs and the rapidly growing games consoles market. Nintendo completely fails to show any environmental credentials and Microsoft and Philips do little better.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greener Electronics Guide is our way of getting the electronics industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide ranks companies&lt;/a&gt; according to their policies and practices on toxic chemicals and takeback. Along with mobile phone and personal computer companies, we've now added the biggest makers of TVs and games consoles. Old TVs are a large part of e-waste and the games console market is one of the fastest growing in consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-nintendo-r.pdf"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; has the dubious honour of being the first company to score 0/10 in the guide. &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-microsoft.pdf"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; did little better, scoring only 2.7. &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-philips-ra.pdf"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; is the lowest TV-maker scoring only 2. The companies are new to the Guide so have plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25257/greener-electronics-sony-erics-3.pdf"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; has taken over number one spot from Nokia while Samsung and Sony have surged ahead to now occupy second and third positions. Nokia and Motorola have each had a penalty point deducted after we found their claims of global takeback were not being matched by actual practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matching words to actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested the implementation of product takeback programmes in six countries where Motorola, Nokia and Sony Ericsson claim, on their websites, to operate product takeback programmes. Nokia representatives in the Philippines, Thailand, Argentina, Russia and India were not informed about their companies' own programmes and in many cases provided misleading information. Motorola staff in the Philippines, Thailand and India were unable to direct customers to collection points in their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one example from our investigations when we visited a Nokia centre recommended by Nokia for recycling phones in Argentina with a hidden camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="425" height="355" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/qjt0-NrlqoQ&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qjt0-NrlqoQ&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Nokia falls from top position to ninth and Motorola drops from ninth position to fourteenth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies shouldn't be under any illusions that we won't check up on their claims of green greatness," commented Iza Kruszewska, toxics campaigner at Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies making the most progress with new products without the worst toxic chemicals are now ranking higher than companies who have only committed to remove them in the future. Toshiba has laptops free of toxic chemicals like &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#pvc"&gt; vinyl plastic (PVC)&lt;/a&gt; and has reduced the use of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic#bfr"&gt; brominated flame retardants&lt;/a&gt; (BFRs). Apple's score improves slightly due to new iMacs reducing the use of PVC and BFRs. All new mobiles from Sony Ericsson and Nokia have been free of PVC since the end of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide focuses on toxic chemicals and takeback policy because of the rapid growth in quantities of toxic e-waste being dumped in developing countries like China and India. While Nintendo's Wii console appears to be more energy efficient compared to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation, energy use is not yet covered in the ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies have made big strides to improve their products and recycling schemes since the introduction of the Guide. But no company has so far succeeded in offering a entire range of products free of the worst toxic chemicals or a comprehensive, free, global takeback scheme to ensure responsible recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

	It was an unprecedented election campaign in Australia. Every party was forced to take a position on climate change. In the end, Labor was victorious - boosted by a pledge to sign the Kyoto Protocol and generate 20 percent of Australia's energy from renewable sources by 2020.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/11/15-november-7am-shutting-dow.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2007/11/15-november-7am-shutting-dow.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            To cut greenhouse gas emissions, we must close dirty coal-fired power plants like Munmorah in NSW (pictured).
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the world's only international agreement
with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. John
Howard, the outgoing Australian Prime Minister, refused to sign it.
Kevin Rudd, the new Prime Minster, made it an election issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard lost.  He was even defeated in his home district, losing
his seat in Parliament - something that's happened to a Prime
Minister only once before in Australian history - and that was in
1929.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear Aussies care about climate change, and with the issue
central to the Australian Labor Party's winning campaign, the
nation will want and expect to see real action on the issue, and
fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ratifying Kyoto is a good first step. But the key indicator of
the new government's success will be if emissions begin to decrease
during this term, and the only way that is possible is to rid
Australia of its addiction to coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next round of Kyoto negotiations is only a week away. When
the US delegation shows up in Bali, Indonesia, for the talks
they'll be isolated more than ever. Rudd's decision to sign Kyoto
leaves the US as the only major industrialized nation refusing to
commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate scientists are telling us that emissions of greenhouse
gases must peak in just seven years - 2015 - and then be reduced,"
said Shane Rattenbury, Greenpeace International political director.
"We expect that when Kevin Rudd goes to the Bali negotiations in
two weeks' time, he will take a position of leadership rather than
being the destructive force that Australia has been over the past
decade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hit 'Stop' on coal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/sites/petition/coal/?MM_URL=gpi-aussie-election"&gt;Australians:  Remind Prime Minister Rudd why you voted him in - to take action on climate change!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=gpi-aussie-election"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	It’s said that a week is a long time in politics. The burning question is whether two weeks is long enough for governments to finally wake up, smell the carbon and confront the biggest problem facing the world. Yes, says Greenpeace. Absolutely.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real action for the climate means tackling the biggest emitters like coal fired power stations. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is plain and simple: stop bickering. Put aside your
differences. Come up with a crystal-clear mandate so negotiators
can go full-bore over the next two years to agree deep cuts in
global warming pollution. And make sure that the long-neglected
issue of ending deforestation is firmly in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Real action for the climate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, governments have let us, their citizens, down by
failing to get to grips with the problem. They've left us
increasingly exposed to the biggest threat that civilisation has
ever faced. Before things get totally out of hand, governments have
to knuckle down to business in Bali and act on the basis of the
alarming scientific findings about climate change that they
themselves approved at the IPCC meeting only a few weeks ago. They
agreed that climate change can be beaten using means already at our
disposal or just around the corner. So let's finally see some real
action for the climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without serious cuts in global warming pollution, the future
will be more frightening and insecure than we can imagine. And it's
no longer the dim and distant future we're talking about. We are
into the realm of IMTO - "In My Term of Office". One government -
in Australia - has already been thrown out partly because it
consistently stonewalled on climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now major global corporations are at long last viewing action
against climate change as a growth opportunity and calling for
legally-binding commitments. It's the secure framework they need to
put big bucks into solutions, even if many companies have still to
put their own house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks is a short time for a political turn-round. But it can
be done. Although not a single gram of carbon will be cut nor a
single sapling saved as a direct result of Bali - for these are
talks about talks - without agreement there governments may well
have lost the opportunity of ever putting the brakes on climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

Japan,Canada, India, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Russia,
Australia,Indonesia and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the goal of this meeting? To persuade other countries

wouldjoin with 175 other countries, and sign the Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries meeting in Washington accountfor over 90% of
emissions worldwide. Real action by those gathered inWashington
could deliver massive cuts in emissions under the KyotoProtocol.
But this would require binding, mandatory targets forindustrialized
countries, which the US rejects.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The second biggest nuclear disaster in history</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mayak-nuclear-disaster280907/</url><text>
	Everybody knows that the biggest nuclear catastrophe in history was Chernobyl. But how many have heard of the second biggest? Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of a radiation nightmare.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ramzis has hydrocephalus. “I don’t like to go to school, because the boys call me bad names. The girls avoid me and don’t want to go out with me. I hope I will not have children who look like me.” Ramzis lives near Mayak, the site of a former Russian nuclear plant and the most radioactively polluted place on Earth.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayak nuclear plant in the Southern Urals was one of the dark secrets of the cold war. It was the Soviet Union's primary nuclear complex, a massive set of plutonium production reactors, fuel production facilities, and reprocessing and waste storage buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957 a storage tank with highly radioactive liquid waste exploded. More than half the amount of radioactive waste released by the accident in Chernobyl was blasted into the atmosphere. A few villagers were evacuated, but most were not. 217 towns and at least 272,000 people were exposed to chronic levels of radiation. The plume was 50 kilometers wide and 1,000 kilometers long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the explosion wasn't the only incident of contamination. Between 1948 and 1956 radioactive waste was poured straight into the Techa River, the source of drinking water for many villages. It exposed 124,000 people to medium and high levels of radiation. Nuclear waste was also dumped into the lakes of West Siberia, where storms blew nuclear dust across a vast area around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The largest nuclear complex in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, around 7,000 people still live in direct contact with the highly polluted Techa river or on contaminated land. In the town of Muslyumovo, studies have show genetic abnormalities to be 25 times more frequent than in other areas of Russia. The incidents of malignant cancer are significantly higher. And the number of residents of Muslyumovo on the Russian national oncology registers is nearly 4 times higher than in the rest of Russia. In other surrounding towns and villages people have cancer rates more than double the Russian average. (See the Greenpeace Report, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/mayak-a-50-year-tragedy/"&gt; Mayak: A 50-Year Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a century later, Mayak is one of the most radioactive places on Earth, and the accident continues to have a devastating legacy. Many thousands of people have never been evacuated from contaminated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch photo-journalist, Robert Knoth, visited the Mayak region in 2000 and 2001 and took a series of &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/mayak/testimonies/image-gallery.html"&gt; highly disturbing pictures of the victims&lt;/a&gt; of radiation in the region. &lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;(Parental warning: The link above contains images of malformed foetuses and other disturbing photos.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25285/nine-year-old-kostya-victim-o.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, the real tragedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, no government could oversee this kind of disaster and not decide to change its ways. Yet, rather than learning the lessons of the tragedy, the Russian Government has passed legislation to import spent nuclear fuel from other countries to Mayak that would then permanently stay at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the countries shipping their dirty nuclear waste to Russia would allow Mayak to continue operating on their own land. Countries considering sending their radioactive waste to Russia are abdicating responsibility for their nuclear activities by dumping it somewhere else. They may like to think that once it's out of their sight they've got rid of the problem, but nothing could be further from the truth. The people who will suffer its devastating effects are right here, the same victims that have suffered the effects of the radiation disaster for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign fuel processed in Mayak so far has led to some three million cubic metres of radioactive liquid being dumped and released into the environment. Mayak has reprocessed over 1,540 tons of spent nuclear fuel from several countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities now hope to negotiate future reprocessing contracts with Switzerland, Spain, South Korea, Slovenia, Italy, Belgium, and Slovakia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 50 year contamination legacy, Mayak is a horrific example of the true face of the global nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of Mayak is that nuclear energy is not a solution. This anniversary should serve as a wake-up call to the world about the real costs of nuclear power. Nuclear power &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/nuclear_fallacy/"&gt; undermines&lt;/a&gt; the solutions to climate change, by diverting resources away from the massive investment in renewable technologies and energy efficiency the world urgently needs to tackle the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We need your help to keep working for a green and peaceful planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Ban Ki-Moon knows a thing or two about climate change and, as head of the UN, the world’s top diplomat knows a thing or two about politics.  When our own executive director, Dr. Gerd Leipold, got in the lift at the UN bound for the 38th floor, he came to ask Ban for strong leadership at the UN climate change meeting on Monday (24th).
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon meets with Greenpeace.  From left to right: Daniel Mittler, Athena Ronquillo, Gerd Leipold, Ban Ki-moon, Jamie Choi and John Passacantando.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Secretary General has real moral authority. We hope that
Ban Ki-moon will use it to call for a "Bali Mandate". What's that?
It's what we need to get out of the biggest climate negotiations in
over a decade that will take place in Bali, Indonesia at the end of
the year. It's a rescue plan for planet earth, which will result in
a strengthened Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ban and Leipold discussed climate change -  both agreeing about
the urgency of the situation and moral imperative of taking
concrete action based upon equity to protect people and the planet
from runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Secretary General laid it out for us: "We need you,
Greenpeace, to mobilize public opinion and enable politicians to do
the right thing." Putting the ball squarely in our court and that
of our supporters. Strong leadership is only half of the equation;
public pressure is the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Greenpeace delegation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Greenpeace staff joined in the meeting.  To show our
diversity, and to deliver their own messages:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;John Passacantando&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, ably represented those
in the US that do not endorse the position and intransigence of the
Bush administration. Passacantando told how people in the US are
already addressing the climate emergency.  He also urged the
Secretary General to ignore Bush's "big emitters" conference next
week, dismissing it as a diversion tactic from a president no one
is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jamie Choi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, a young Korean activist working for Greenpeace China,
described how the energy revolution is already underway in Asia. 
Adding that many young people have grown impatient with slow moving
governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Athena Ronquillo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Mittler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, two of our policy experts, who've been first hand participants
through years of climate change political meetings, were also
there.  Ronquillo gave a quick outline of what we'll be doing in
the next few months to ramp up the pressure on politicians on the
Road to Bali and how we will push for a meaningful mandate to
tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Two climate meetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meeting with the General Secretary is a prelude to the UN
'informal' Climate Summit on Monday, September 24th, in New York,
with some 80 heads of state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this meeting next week, we are again among the speakers
addressing delegates and heads of state. Greenpeace China campaign
director Sze Ping will talk about our work there, and how China can
be part of the solution to climate change.  And he will deliver the
message of our energy revolution: We have to technology we need. We
just need to use energy smarter and ensure a massive uptake of
renewable energies and we can still avert climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later next week, the Bush administration will host its own
climate change meeting, scheduled to start September 27th in
Washington, DC.  This is the so-called "big emitters" meeting since
it's for the 16 countries that account for 90 percent of global
warming emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush is expected to keep pushing the idea of "aspirational
targets".  They are nothing legally binding or meaningful. At best,
they are a random wish list - that will still result in a cooked
planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be at the meeting too, providing analysis,
comment and opposition to this distraction from the real task.  We
need real commitment at the next climate talks. Not more fluff.
"The clock is ticking", Ban Ki-moon told us yesterday. There truly
is no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not have an invitation to the UN, but you've got an
invitation from us.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=Ban-meet"&gt;Join the 7
steps programme.&lt;/a&gt;  We'll send you seven emails over seven weeks
with simple ways you can put the heat on politicians and business
leaders. We need your help over the next few months to increase
political pressure on the road to Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, world leaders gathered in New York City for the
largest United Nations meeting on climate change since the Rio
Earth Summit in 1992.  Top officials from 150 countries (including
80 heads of state) plus big names like Al Gore and Arnold
Schwarzenegger were in attendance - and so were we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The time for doubt has passed," as UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon said in his opening address.  Ban sees the world's response
to global warming as something that, "will define us, our era, and
ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore told the world leaders, "We have to overcome the paralysis
that has prevented us from acting".  Governor Schwarzenegger called
for, "action, action, action".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one, heads of state stood up and essentially echoed their
sentiments.  Our own Lo Sze Ping, from Greenpeace China, told the
attendees that the world's worst per capita emitting countries need
to stop using developing countries as an excuse not to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo went on to call for an energy revolution with massive uptake
in energy saving and renewable energy technology world wide, and
real action by world leaders rather than more talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the climate negotiations in December, you must therefore
agree to nothing short of a Bali Mandate," he said. "Not a road map
to nowhere, not a wish list."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bali Mandate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting on climate change negotiations under the Kyoto
Protocol will take place on the island of Bali in December.
Greenpeace is pushing for world leaders to strengthen the Kyoto
Protocol at these meetings. Industrialized countries must begin the
process of negotiating emissions reductions of 30 percent by 2020,
and at least 80 percent by 2050 in order to prevent climate chaos. 
This is what the best and latest science tells us is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings in Bali must advance a negotiating agenda, a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/briefing-bali-mandate"&gt;
Bali Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, to combat climate change on all fronts, including
adaptation, mitigation, clean technologies, deforestation and
resource mobilization. All countries must do what they can to reach
agreement by 2009, and to have it in force at the end of the
current Kyoto Protocol commitment period at the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;US remains isolated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President George W. Bush was not among the heads of state at
the high level UN climate change meeting.  He only showed up late
at the end of the day to dine with a select group.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Bush has scheduled his own &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/guide-to-major-climate-meetings/"&gt;
meeting&lt;/a&gt; for this Thursday and Friday in Washington, DC, limited
to the countries with the largest global warming emissions.  Bush's
meeting, imaginatively dubbed the "Major Emitters Meeting", is
widely seen as part of his strategy to avoid legally binding caps
on greenhouse gas emissions.  Instead, Bush is pushing for
voluntary, "aspirational" targets with no weight behind them. Bush
is just pretending to care. The world must not be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ban_ki-moon_leipold070920/"&gt;
our meeting with Ban&lt;/a&gt;, last Wednesday, Greenpeace USA executive
director, John Passacantando, reassured the UN Secretary General
that people in the US are ready to tackle climate change, and
dismissed the Big Emitters Meeting as a diversion tactic from a
president no one is listening to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/7steps?MM_URL=UN-climate-meet07"&gt;Take the future into your own hands.

	All drinks at the Olympics are on us, kind of. Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola today announced a commitment to use coolers and vending machines free of HFC gases in all official venues of the 2008 Olympic Games, demonstrating climate-friendly technology developed by Greenpeace. Getting to here has been an amazing journey over 20 years involving the most unlikely characters and situations -- even George W. Bush makes a last-minute appearance.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;CFCs to HFCs: frying pan to fire&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the dramatic discovery of the ozone hole in 1986 forced
thebanning of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), the refrigeration
industryswitched to hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). HFC's don't destroy
the ozonelike CFC's can. But they do cause global warming. Indeed,
some HFCgases are up to 11,000 times more harmful to the climate
than carbondioxide (CO2), your garden variety greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Solution: Greenfreeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To highlight the madness of this switch from CFC's to HFC's
andshow how it should bedone, Greenpeace launched the concept of
Greenfreeze in 1992. We mettwoscientists who pointed out how to
avoid HFC's altogether. We found anold fridge factory, appealed to
our supporters to pre-order enoughunits to finance a refit, helped
build the market and Greenfreeze wasborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses natural gases so avoids both depleting the ozone layer
andfuelling global warming. The chemical industry said it would
never workand the big refrigeration users lined up with their
friends in theindustry to dismiss our claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that was then, and this is now. Today there are over
100million Greenfreeze refrigerators in theworld, produced by all
the major European, Chinese, Japanese and Indianmanufacturers. It
is now available in most major markets with theexception of North
America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenfreeze technology gradually gained a foothold in
thedomestic market in the late 1990's, large commercial users
continued touse refrigeration that causes global warming. In the
run up to theSydney Olympics in 2000 we targeted big refrigeration
users such asUnilever, Coke and McDonalds, all Olympic sponsors, to
live up to theguidelines of the green games which excluded
HFC's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ More on the &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/"&gt;history of
Greenfreeze&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Coke in the spotlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coke caved in after a concerted online
campaign(CokeSpotlight.org)before the 2000 Olympics to buy green
refrigeration for new units.Before the start of the games all three
companies we had targeted&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/top-companies-ditch-climate-wr/"&gt;
announced phase outplans&lt;/a&gt; for damaging refrigeration
technologies by the time of the 2004Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Coke plans to install no less than6,350climate-friendly
coolers and vending machines in the Olymic Gamesvenues in Beijing
and six co-host cities throughout China. Calculatedbased on an
expected ten year life span of the units, they reducegreenhouse gas
emissions by approximately 4,500 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isthe first time that 100 percent of the coolers and
vending machinesprovided by Coca-Cola to all Olympics venues will
feature HFC-freeinsulation, and HFC-free natural refrigerant. For
good measure, Cokehas also added a proprietary technology called
Energy Management System(EMS) that improves energy efficiency by
more than 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thisinnovative approach of combining natural refrigerants and
energyefficient technology is a great example of how a business can
workwith other stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We
hopeCoca-Cola's efforts can accelerate industry-wide actions to
combatclimate change," said LO Sze Ping, Campaign and
CommunicationsDirector of Greenpeace China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's next for HFC's  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by Coca-Cola, the&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL1475766720070914"&gt;
Whitehouseis rumouredto beplanning an announcement&lt;/a&gt; at next
week's UN meeting on ozone depletingsubstances (the Montreal
Protocol), proposing aggressive targets tophase-out HFC gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, HFC's are expected tocontribute up to 5.2
percent of the world's global warming emissions by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take much more than publicpronouncements to tackle the
climate crisis. But as the Montreal Protocol comes to it's 20th
anniversary, and the story ofGreenfreeze demonstrates, creativity,
vigilance and a "can do!"attitude can transform even the most
familiar/dire characters andsituations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=Coke-Olympics"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	One week into the Philippines leg of our flagship the Rainbow Warrior’s Quit Coal tour and senior politicians are lining up to support our Quit Coal call to protect the climate.

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Albay Province Vice Governor Brando Sael reads a statement declaring Albay as a COAL FREE ZONE.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day one, immediately following our press conference in Albay
to explain the campaign, local Governor Joey Sarte Salceda called
for Albay to be a coal-free zone. He said: "We believe there is no
place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly
there is no place for coal in Albay." He called on all developed
countries to reject coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later the Warrior and crew were outside Pagbilao
coal-fired power plant, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/philippines-coal-blockade-230508/"&gt;
blockading shipments of coal&lt;/a&gt;. That unleashed a media frenzy,
with the front pages of the biggest papers in the Philippines
relaying our message that the country needs to quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped the protest when Senator Zubiri announced in a
communiqué to the Rainbow Warrior:  "I will file a resolution in
the Senate seeking a halt in the construction of new coal fired
power plants in the country.  In tandem will be a strong Renewable
Energy Bill that shall allow us to shift towards a low carbon
economy, and away from dependence on fossil fuels, particularly
coal. Coal carries huge environmental, health and social
costs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great start. But then today, we received another statement of
support when Senator Pia Juliana Cayetano, who chairs the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources and is the principal sponsor of the
proposed renewable energy act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cayetano declared: "I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a
coal-free Philippines. The threat of climate change demands a shift
towards a sustainable, clean and low carbon future. Government
should lay out concrete plans for implementing clean energy
solutions in the power sector."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours later the call was echoed by Congressman Lorenzo R.
Tañada III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels and the largest
single source of CO2 in the world. Currently, one-third of all
carbon dioxide emissions come from burning coal. In the Philippines
eight coal-fired power stations produce 36% of the country's energy
emissions, and the government plans to build or expand nine power
plants. Instead the Philippines need to improve the efficiency of
its energy system, embrace renewable energy and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These political developments and statements of support for our
call to Quit Coal show the impact our campaign is having. The Albay
declaration spelled out an agenda, and the peaceful confrontation
at Pagbilao has started a process that could lead to the
Philippines quitting coal for good. We'll be keeping up the
pressure in the coming days and weeks - working to deliver the
energy [r]evolution that the world needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quit Coal tour is just part of our global campaign against
coal. In recent months we've blocked coal exports in New Zealand
and power plant construction in Holland and Germany. Last week, as
our activists in the Philippines were preparing for action, a team
in Israel were delivering the message to their government. We've
also brought out a comprehensive report showing that the industries
talk of carbon sequestration is just an 'end of pipe' dream used to
justify building more coal power plants that will never be
clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;We're sending a message to the world leaders who will be meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia, and the UK join YOU by becoming energy [r]evolutionaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Island contaminated by illegal GMO</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/island-contaminated-050907/</url><text>
	Environmental activists today placed an entire island under strict quarantine after finding illegal genetically modified (GMO) soya being grown there. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/9/greenpeace-activists-put-brail.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/9/greenpeace-activists-put-brail.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists put Braila island, on the Danube river, under quarantine, after Greenpeace field investigations revealed that illegal Genetically Modified (GMO) Soya, is being grown and harvested there.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bralia Island in Romania is normally a quiet farming area on the
Danube river but now it is the site of a huge environmental
contamination by soya that has been genetically modified by the
agricultural-chemical company, Monsanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful action in Romania began early in the morning when
30 Greenpeace activists from across Europe set up a
'decontamination station' at the ferry harbour area on Braila
Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All vehicles leaving the island were decontaminated by being
thoroughly washed to prevent the genetic contamination from
spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for member states of the European Union (EU) which
includes Romania, to cultivate GMO Soya. Greenpeace is calling on
the Romanian government and the European Commission to act
immediately to locate and destroy all of the illegally cultivated
GMO Soya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have taken action to protect the rest of Romania from
contamination by these illegal GMO crops, which pose massive risks
to the environment, biodiversity and human heath. Romanian people
have overwhelmingly rejected GMO," said Gabriel Paun, Greenpeace
Romania, GMO campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not the first time Greenpeace has discovered illegal
GMO production in Romania, the situation is out of control. The
Government must immediately locate and destroy all of the crops
before they enter the food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as activists were decontaminating Bralia Island
in Romania, more activists were busy taking action against another
site of GMO contamination in France. 20 volunteers painted a field
of illegally grown GMO maize (corn) bright red, in order to expose
its location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMO maize, known as MON810, is another genetically modified
product being pushed onto consumers by Monsanto. The GMO maize is
being illegally grown, as either the farmer, or the French
government have failed to inform the public of its presence as
required under French law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By failing to take control, the Romanian and French governments
are allowing biotech companies such as Monsanto, to run riot over
their environment and ignore the wishes of European people;
contaminating their food and their fields" said Myrto Pispini,
Greenpeace International GMO campaigner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/sign-up?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Get your free e-zine to keep up to date on how you can protect the environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=bralia"&gt;Help keep our food GMO free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jaguars are tree climbers, but there is no federal law to protecting their forest - so our activists have taken to the trees themselves.  Dressed as jaguars, they're camped in the treetops of the Yungas in a bid to block the bulldozers until a federal law can be passed.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists camp in the tree tops, demanding the implementation of the "law of the Forests".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six days now, the activists have continuously occupied trees
inside a part of the Yungas forest that's a UNESCO Biosphere
Reserve. They'll stay there until "la Ley de Bosques" [the Forest
Law], legislation to protect Argentina's remaining forests, is
agreed by the Argentinean congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Argentina is calling for 1 million signatures to help
get the law passed, and has already collected over 600,000. If you
are Argentinean and have not yet signed, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/cyberacciones/bosques.html?MM_URL=GPI-feature"&gt;
please help by signing now&lt;/a&gt;.  While support from all is welcome,
we need signatures from Argentineans to get this law through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees the activists are living in are up to 25 metres high. 
A 'land team', camping on the forest floor, supports the activists
in the trees, and all of them are trained in jungle survival
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Argentinean forests going fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina's forests are in crisis. Forests are being chopped
down at a rate 8 times faster than the world average, clear cutting
a massive 300,000 hectares a year. To put that figure into context
- Argentina destroys an area of forest the size of 40 football
fields, every HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear cutting means just that; giant bulldozers with anchor
chains knock down all vegetation. Any "debris" is then cleared with
fire, in a matter of days ancient ecosystems are lost - forever.
The land is then used to grow genetically engineered soya, or for
cattle ranching. Jaguars are just one of endangered species, facing
extinction as a result of Argentina's rampant forest destruction,
others include armadillos and giant anteaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5HCAEl3kQPM"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is also one of the biggest sources of greenhouse
gas emissions. Worldwide deforestation is second only to the energy
sector as a contributor to climate change - responsible for up to
one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Law will establish a moratorium on forest conversion
for agriculture land, until a legitimate scheme for sustainable use
of Argentina's remaining forests is established. This needs to be a
transparent process, including indigenous and campesinos (peasant)
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reserva de la Biosfera de las Yungas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yungas rainforest is considered an international hot spot
for biodiversity by international bodies. Back in 2002, UNESCO
declared an area of the Yungas rainforests in Argentina as
'Biosphere Reserve' because of its rich and unique biodiversity.
The official name of the reserve is 'Reserva de la Biosfera de las
Yungas'. Greenpeace volunteers have chosen to occupy trees inside
this reserve, to highlight how even protected areas, are under
threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 34,000 people live in the Reserve and it is home to some
203 different bird species, including the eagle and the military
macaw; its 89 mammal types include the jaguar and the tapir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the UNESCO classification is to contribute
towards sustainable development and conservation. The expansion of
genetically engineered soya cultivation in Argentina makes a
mockery of Las Yungas Biosphere Reserve status, destroying its
unique ecosystems and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our volunteers will remain in the treetops until the Argentinean
senators takes urgent action to give green light to the forests law
and protect what's left of Argentinean forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org.ar/cyberacciones/bosques.html?MM_URL=GPI-feature"&gt;
If you are Argentinean please don't forget to join the hundreds of
thousands of people who are demanding the Senate immediately
approve La Ley de Bosques.&lt;/a&gt; (Sorry, Argentinean's only. But

	The Italian football team apparently love nothing better than a nice dollop of Nutella spread over their bread for breakfast – “breakfast for champions” according to Nutella, the official sponsors for the national team. But what else do Nutella’s owners, the Italian company Ferrero – official sponsor of the entire Euro 2008 Championship - support?
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists dressed as orang-utans bring an alternative breakfast to the Italian national football team, asking them to join in the call for Nutella to 'Save the Forests' of Indonesia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Nutella – a hazelnut-based sweet spread -is immensely popular in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/country-region&gt;,as well as the rest of &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt; and around theworld. Its exact ingredients are, as you might expect, are a closely guardedsecret, but according to two laboratories that analysed the spread forGreenpeace, it is composed of 31% vegetable oils, most of which is palm oil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Aside from pushing species, such as theorang-utan of &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;city w:st="on"&gt;Borneo&lt;/city&gt;, &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/country-region&gt;&lt;/place&gt;, to the brink ofextinction, the destruction of the world’s rainforests and peatlands to makeway for increased palm-oil plantations is driving climate change - every timethe rainforest is trashed, huge amounts of greenhouse gases are released intothe atmosphere. The destruction of rainforests accounts for a fifth of allgreenhouse gas emissions – that’s more than all the planes, trains and automobilesin the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;We sent along the “&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Borneo&lt;/place&gt;football team” – eleven orang-utans! – to explain. Arriving at the Italiansquad’s official training centre, the orang-utans presented the footballerswith an alternative “breakfast for champions” – a chocolate cream called &lt;i&gt;Deforestazione Zero &lt;/i&gt;– and asked them tosupport our call for Zero Deforestation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Greenpeace has been calling on Ferrero todeclare its purchasing policy on palm oil, to assure us and its customers thatNutella is not being produced from palm oil that comes from deforestation. Sofar, we’ve had no positive news, which is why we’re asking the Italian nationalteam to champion the cause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Ferrero is a member of the Roundtable onSustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an international association which has been put incharge of making the palm oil sector more sustainable. Despite the fact thatthe RSPO has existed since 2002, there is still no certified palm oil on themarket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Greenpeace has produced a report, “&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/hidden-carbon-liability-of-palm-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;TheHidden Carbon Liability of Indonesian Palm Oil&lt;/a&gt;”, which highlights theurgent need for global palm oil consumers and investors to support our call foran immediate moratorium on deforestation and peatland clearance in &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/country-region&gt;&lt;/place&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;One of the major companies using palm oilin its products is Unilever, which heads up the RSPO. Using Unilever's palm oilsupply chains as a case study to help quantify the carbon liability andcollateral risks associated with the Indonesian palm oil sector, the reportshows how, by buying palm oil from suppliers who account for more than &lt;b&gt;one-thirdof Indonesia's palm oil production&lt;/b&gt;, companies - including Ferrero and othermajor players such as Nestlé, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and Kraft - are increasingtheir potential carbon liability and thus leaving investors exposed topotentially significant levels of hidden risk, compromising long-term financialand brand stability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-monkey-business210408/"&gt;
&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Following Greenpeace pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;, Unilever has &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-palm-oil080501/"&gt;recognised the global problems associated with palmoil expansion&lt;/a&gt; and the need for drastic reform to this sector. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-challenge150508/"&gt;Unilever hastaken a bold move&lt;/a&gt; in supporting our call for an immediate moratorium ondeforestation and peatland clearance. While Unilever's position is strengthenedby its status as the largest single palm oil consumer in the world, companieslike Ferrero need to join with Unilever, support the moratorium and spread the callfor a halt to deforestation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments.

	Our planet's oceans are in deep, deep, peril, says a new report from the Worldwatch Institute.  The only road to recovery may be to declare 40 percent of the world's oceans off-limits to human exploitation to ensure the restoration of life in depleted areas.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth's surface is 70 percent covered by ocean, and
three-quarters of humanity live in coastal areas. We are hugely
dependent on marine resources - yet our oceans are facing threats
that include overfishing, toxic pollution, climate change and
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5352?utm_campaign=oceans_in_peril&amp;amp;utm_medium=link_exchange&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace.org" target="_blank"&gt;new report from the prestigious Worldwatch
Institute, Oceans in Peril: Protecting Marine Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;,
calls for these marine reserves - areas where all extractive and
destructive activities, including fishing are prohibited - while
giving an alarming snapshot of the shocking state of the world's
oceans. It's a wake-up call that should jolt the complacency of
policy makers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written for the Worldwatch Institute by a team of experts - this
time from the Greenpeace Science Unit in the UK's Exeter University
- Oceans in Peril updates an earlier study by the same team in
1998. They have been staggered by the scale and rate of destruction
that has taken place in less than a decade in every ocean on
Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science Unit provides crucial scientific expertise to our
campaigns, and has a long history of working on oceans issues,
including whaling, toxic pollution, climate change and
overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recent studies such as the one which shows how 90 percent of
the world's large predatory fish, which include the sharks,
swordfish and tuna, have disappeared due to overfishing since the
1950s have helped expose what has been happening under the waves
and have therefore been out of sight and out of mind to most
people", says Paul Johnston, Greenpeace's chief scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril details new and emerging threats, such the
increasing acidification of the world's oceans, and underscores how
the race for ever-diminishing resources is forcing marine
ecosystems to the point of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report illustrates how 76 percent of the world's fish stocks
are fully or overexploited, an estimate borne out by figures from
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which
suggest that 158 million tons of fish were harvested worldwide in
2005 - a seven-fold increase since 1950.  Catch records between
1950 and 2000 show the "collapse" of 366 out 1,519 fisheries
worldwide, most famously the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/no-cod-blame-the-seals/"&gt;
Grand Banks cod fishery&lt;/a&gt; off Newfoundland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25292/a-good-catch-of-orange-roughy.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;©Greenpeace/Grace Orange Roughy and
bycatch in the Tasman Sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans in Peril also details the pitfalls of fish farming, the
supposed magic bullet of marine resources with alarming statistics:
producing carnivorous animals such as salmon or marine shrimp
requires 2.5 as much fishmeal as the amount of saleable fish
eventually produced. For tuna caught in the wild and fattened in
"ranches", the weight of fish fed to the tuna is a shocking 20
times more than what is actually produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage to thousands of marine animals and entire ecosystems
by the likes of longlining and bottom trawling, as well as
overfishing off the coast of developing countries, is exacerbated
the estimated 20 percent of the global catch that is illegal,
unregulated or unreported, and worth somewhere between US$4-9
billion a year. While countries with enough resources to control
their own waters stand some chance of putting measures in place to
protect resources, there's little or no regulation of any kind of
marine harvesting in international waters - an issue that needs to
be urgently addressed at an international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not all doom and gloom - there is a beam of sunshine in
the report, including a comprehensive package of measures that if
implemented could reverse current trends, restoring the former
productivity of our planet's oceans. That solution is the
establishment of comprehensive marine reserves all over the world, 
protecting vulnerable species and habitats, enhancing fisheries
beyond the reserve boundaries, and buffering the worst impacts of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine reserves are the single most powerful tool available for
arresting and reversing the decline of our oceans and are equally
applicable to the high seas as they are to coastal waters. The
oceans have immense powers of regeneration and wherever in the
world marine reserves have been established marine life is
flourishing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	France’s nuclear safety agency today took the commendable step of ordering construction work to be halted on the concrete base slab of the new European Pressurised Reactor, Flamanville 3, in northern France. Over recent months, the agency’s inspectors have uncovered a string of chronic faults in construction -- which only began in December 2007.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-occupy-epr-nuclear-p.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-occupy-epr-nuclear-p.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The French nuclear safety agency agrees: it's time to stop the construction of the European Pressurized Water Reactor.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues seem to have come to a head on 21 May. Maybe that
explains why Anne Lauvergeon, Chief Executive Officer of AREVA, the
French nuclear company aggressively backing the European
Pressurised Reactor (EPR), 'exploded' when we handed her a copy of
the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-survival-kit/"&gt;
Greenpeace 'EPR Survival Kit'&lt;/a&gt; during the European Nuclear
Energy Forum on the 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, for nuclear regulators in France, enough is enough.
We can only hope that their move is not merely a temporary setback
to construction but the beginning of the end of a failed experiment
in building the world's largest nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we pointed out to Europe's energy policymakers at the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/illuminating-the-manipulation/"&gt;
last week's European Nuclear Energy Forum, "Nuclear power? Non,
merci!"&lt;/a&gt; is the correct response to anyone approaching you to
buy an EPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;French letters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulators' call to halt construction follows a series of
letters from the agency to Flamanville's construction manager. In
the letters, inspectors highlighted a range of problems including
&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority-3.pdf"&gt;
non-conformities in the pinning of the steel framework&lt;/a&gt; of the
concrete base slab, incorrectly positioned reinforcements,
inadequacy of technical inspection by both the construction
companies and Electricité de France. Inspectors also uncovered
inconsistencies between the blueprint for reinforcement work and
the plan for its practical implementation. The incorrect
composition of concrete had been used, that may lead to cracks and
rapid deterioration in sea air conditions. Samples of concrete were
also not collected properly, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority-2.pdf"&gt;
according to inspectors&lt;/a&gt;. Cracks have already been observed in
part of the base slab beneath the reactor building. The supplier of
the steel containment liner reportedly lacks the necessary
qualifications. Fabrication of the liner was continuing despite
quality failures demonstrating the lack of competence of the
supplier. As a result, &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25168/asn-nuclear-safety-authority.pdf"&gt;
one-quarter of the welds of the steel liner of the reactor
containment building were deficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Déjà vu all over again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new reactors Flamanville 3 and Olkiluoto 3, in Finland, are
supposedly the vanguard of a 'renaissance' in nuclear power,
leading to a whole series of these type of reactors being built
around the world. (It certainly seems to be a renaissance in the
kinds of problems we hoped would be relegated to history as the
number of a new nuclear builds declined in the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems at Flamanville echo those with the first EPR, Olkiluoto
3, which has been under construction for three years but has been
blighted ever since the concrete was poured. Poor quality concrete,
bad welds on the containment liner and low-quality reactor
components are among its problems. The schedule for completion has
been put back by more than two years and estimated costs have
nearly doubled to over Euro 5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flamanville 3 is the umpteenth example of the nuclear industry
failing to learn the lessons of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cradle to grave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the problems of an unbuilt reactor aren't enough of a
headache for the nuclear industry, the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7421879.stm"&gt;BBC
reports&lt;/a&gt; that in the UK the cost of cleaning up old nuclear
sites, including some deemed "dangerous" will soar beyond 144
billion Euros (US$ 91 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has consistently argued that nuclear power is an
unnecessarily complex, risky and expensive way to boil water, to
raise steam, to generate power. James Watt will be turning in his
grave. In defiance of all logic, enormous sums of public money have
been devoted to unsuccessfully overcoming the technical obstacles
inherent to nuclear power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time policymakers and power companies realised that
businesses and citizens want clean reliable power at an affordable
price rather than new monuments to the pursuit of technological
folly. What's more, preventing dangerous climate change means
halving global carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century. &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy efficiency
improvements and expansion of clean energy supply&lt;/a&gt; - not more
nuclear capacity - are the key to delivering this energy
revolution.  &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Stone Age car lobby exposed</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stone-age-car-lobby-exposed-260508/</url><text>
	Fred and Wilma Flintstone kindly lent their 'vintage' car to some of our activists for the day. We wanted to drive it to the European Parliament and deliver a stone tablet bearing the logos of Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes alongside the message "Driving climate change". The car industry is well and truly stuck in the stone age, with potentially dire consequences for the climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/flintstone-car-lobby.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The car industry is still trapped in the "dinosaur dynamic" of building ever-faster and increasingly powerful gas-guzzlers at the expense of the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Flintstone's car journey started from the headquarters of
the European car lobby group ACEA. This group represents the major
European car manufactures and lobbies European politicians to
prevent growing carbon dioxide emissions from cars being
effectively curbed by regulation. Unfortunately &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/05/flintstones_arrested.html"&gt;
police arrested our car&lt;/a&gt; before it could reach the European
Parliament. In contrast lobbyists from the ACEA, determined to
ensure the special interests of the car industry come before
tackling climate change, continue to enjoy unfettered access to
European politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, Europe's MEPs are going to be discussing some new
proposals to make car manufacturers clean up their act. If the new
plans are approved, manufacturers will have to limit the amount of
carbon dioxide that comes out of car exhausts. We want MEPs to be
left in no doubt that these measures are desperately needed if
climate change is to be effectively limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures are not before time. Our new report &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/DrivingClimateChange"&gt;
"Driving Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt; reveals how the car industry, led by
the German car companies, has misled and manipulated Europe's
policy makers for the past 17 years, to stop them from imposing
mandatory limits on emissions. Each time Europe has suggested
introducing legislation, car makers have been quick to claim that
laws aren't needed because they will take sufficient action
voluntarily. Of course they've done no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the industry has used gains in performance to build
heavier and more powerful cars rather than deliver more fuel
efficiency. The EU has let them get away with it. Now they realise
that the car industry's stone age attitude might mean Europe could
miss its carbon emission reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="width" value="425"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The willingness of the EU to roll over in the past has no doubt
been helped by some of the underhand lobbying tactics employed by
the car industry. Our report details how manufacturers have
rewarded political supporters with loaned cars and other perks and
explains how Europe's Commissioner with responsibility for
enterprise and industry, Verheugen, formed an influential lobby
group, CARS 21, which used his access at the very highest levels to
lean on policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the EU is pledging to take action. To be effective the
legislation must ensure the average new car sold in 2012 emits just
120g of CO2 per km, and for that standard to be strengthened to a
limit of 80g p/km by 2020. Even though the EU is currently
proposing legislation that doesn't &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/12/why_the_european_efficiency_pr.html"&gt;
do quite enough&lt;/a&gt; the car industry is fighting tooth and nail to
make sure it doesn't go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament must stand firm and resist the car
lobby's attempts to run down the EU's first ever fuel economy
standard. The new law should also impose penalties on manufacturers
who fail to meet the new standards and resist attempts to give
special treatment to the makers of heavy cars. If they do, the car
industry will finally have met its match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/merkel-cars-letter/"&gt;Please write to the Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, today asking her to support strong emissions standards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation.

	Greenpeace lit up central Prague for the past two evenings with giant projected slogans reminding the public, media and energy decision makers about the risks of nuclear power versus the benefits of clean energy. We illuminated Prague; we were also putting a spotlight on delegates at the second European Nuclear Energy Forum.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists project anti-nuclear slogans from a boat in Prague’s Vltava River during the formal dinner attended by delegates to the European Nuclear Energy Forum. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the public relations spin at face value, you might think
nuclear power has put behind it blunders like the Chernobyl
catastrophe of 1986 and is finally ready to deliver cheap, safe
power, overcome climate change and ensure energy security. All
together quite a set of claims! But, as Greenpeace highlighted this
week in Prague during the second meeting of the European Nuclear
Energy Forum, it's only the nuclear industry's propaganda that's
been revamped. The technology still can't deliver what's written on
the packet and the nuclear industry's ambitions remain as
unrealistic as ever. And it's having to rely on a heavily
pro-nuclear biased Forum to make its case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slogans in the night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace lit up central Prague for the past two evenings with
giant projected slogans reminding the public, media and energy
decision makers about the risks of nuclear power versus the
benefits of clean energy. Prague Castle formed the first backdrop
for "Nuclear underlines climate protection" and "Energy Revolution
NOW!", shone from an industrial-size beamer. The images featured a
shattered radiation motif symbolising the chronic flaws in nuclear
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, senior politicians and energy bosses attending the
Forum's formal dinner were treated to the shattered radiation
symbol and the words "Non, merci!". A strange choice, perhaps, for
a meeting in Prague - but it addresses the ambitions of the French
company AREVA, which is aggressively promoting its fault-ridden
European Pressurised Reactor as the supposed 'flagship' of an
international nuclear renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A funny thing happened on the way to the Forum…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forum was set up after EU Heads of State and Government in
March 2007 endorsed a European Commission proposal "to organise a
broad discussion among all relevant stakeholders on the
opportunities and risks of nuclear energy". Surprising, then, that
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, each with one seat in a Forum
of around 200 people, are the sole invitees from civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We welcome an open and fair debate on nuclear energy," says Jan
Beránek, nuclear energy campaigner from Greenpeace International.
"The arguments about cost, safety, energy security and tackling
climate change are all in favour of clean energy options."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open and fair debate? Think again. Bias was apparent from the
moment the Forum opened. Its first session offered a privileged
position to the CEO of the French nuclear company AREVA to promote
the supposedly cheaper and safer 'European Pressurised Reactor'
(EPR). You'd be forgiven for thinking that the Forum had become a
trade fair for the nuclear lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What happened in Prague was a mockery of a supposedly open
process," says Beránek. "The nuclear industry is arguing for yet
more financial support at the expense of safety, transparency and
respect for public opinion," he continued. A Eurobarometer survey
of public opinion on energy technologies, published in 2007, found
that only 20 percent of people in the EU support the use of nuclear
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Going soft on safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away from public scrutiny, the Forum has been considering a
proposal to lower nuclear safety standards across Europe to those
of the lowest level applied in any Member State. This could place a
stranglehold on national authorities wishing to impose stricter
safety standards. And by artificially lowering the costs of any
future nuclear plants, lenient safety standards would help open the
door for an expansion of nuclear power and expose the environment
and public safety to greater nuclear risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent events demonstrate that nuclear power remains as risky
and controversial as ever. In Spain, information about a recent
leak of radioactive material was kept secret. In Slovakia,
construction work is under preparation on the Mochovce nuclear
plant, which is based on a design from the 1970s and has no
'containment' in place to deal with external impacts. In Finland
and France, construction of the latest generation of French EPR
reactors is showing up the serious lack of competence in the
nuclear industry on issues as fundamental as pouring the concrete
base for the reactors, poor welding and inadequate and sometimes
non-existent quality control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Counter-propaganda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace aimed to blunt enthusiasm among Forum delegates for
the 'flagship' European Pressurised Reactor by distributing an 'EPR
Survival Kit'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entitled "Warning: AREVA at work!", the Greenpeace 'EPR Survival
Kit' was aimed at those foolhardy enough to overlook the chronic
problems affecting current construction of the Finnish and French
EPRs compared to the benefits of investing in energy saving and
renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightly coloured and intentionally flippant in tone, the
"Survival Kit' summarised the serious problems - ranging from poor
quality workmanship and severe delays through to significant cost
overruns. The EPR is a modern design of reactor developed and
aggressively promoted by the French nuclear company AREVA. It
promised cheap and reliable technology but costs in Finland have
exploded to over Euro 5 billion and the construction has been
riddled with faults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;But our work is not yet done! Palm oil isused for a wide range of products – from toothpaste to margarine, and fromwashing powders to soaps.

Even thoughUnilever is the biggest buyer of palm oil, it represents only three percent of palmoil purchasers. The moratorium will need support from other companies if wewant to see real change in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unilever has agreed to rise to thechallenge and lead the way, building a coalition of allies to put pressure on palmoil suppliers in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;to agree to the moratorium. This includes lobbying all the major players in theindustry, including Kraft, Nestlé, Cadburys, Cargill and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Over the coming months, we’ll be meetingwith companies and urging them to join Unilever in supporting the moratoriumand stopping deforestation and the release of greenhouse gases that fuel climatechange. This coalition of influential players in the palm oil industry –together with the support of palm oil suppliers and the Indonesian government -is key to getting the moratorium in place as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There's still a long way to go to ensure that
the climate is protected from further deforestation, that the
bulldozers leave the rainforest and that orang-utans are saved from
extinction in the wild. We'll be keeping you updated - and we'll be
letting you know if we need your help again to put pressure on any
company that may need a bit of an incentive to support the
moratorium!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity have launched a new legal challenge against the US Department of the Interior following its listing of the polar bear as a threatened species. Sadly the decision was made almost meaningless by the inclusion of a massive loophole (technically known as a “4(d) rule”) for global warming pollution. So now we and our allies are going back to court to make sure polar bears get the protection they deserve.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar bears on sea ice.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announced on 14 May, the listing of polar bears as threatened
under the United States Endangered Species Act should have entitled
the bears to many protections. One of the primary protections is
the prohibition against any person, corporation, or other entity
"taking" a listed species, which includes killing or otherwise
harming it. However, the special 4(d) rule attempts to exempt from
regulation both greenhouse gas emissions and activities occurring
outside Alaska. Our new legal challenge aims to overturn this
"special rule".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;"While we successfully forced the administration to
list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act, the
administration is still undercutting all efforts to implement the
law to protect the polar bear,"&lt;/i&gt; said Melanie Duchin, global
warming campaigner for Greenpeace USA in Alaska. &lt;i&gt;"The
administration's continued attempt to block meaningful progress on
global warming is no surprise, but it won't
succeed."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clause is especially astounding after the US Geological
Survey predicted in September 2007 that, based on polar bear
distribution and current global warming projections, two-thirds of
the world's polar bear population would likely be extinct by 2050,
including all polar bears within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though global warming is the biggest threat facing polar
bears, this exemption eliminates any real protection the listing
could have provided for the polar bear. It specifically says
federal agencies don't need to consider the impact of global
warming pollution on the polar bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on
the sea-ice for all of their essential needs, including hunting
their prey. The rapid warming of the Arctic and melting of the
sea-ice poses a serious threat to polar bears. The polar bear could
be the first mammal to lose 100 percent of its habitat to global
warming.  As the ice continues to disappear, so will the polar
bear. The only way to save the polar bear is to stop global warming
and protect their sea-ice habitat from melting away, and the only
way to do that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic melt is also outpacing predictions. September 2007
shattered all previous records for sea-ice loss when the Arctic ice
cap shrank to a record 1 million square miles - equivalent to six
times the size of California - below the average summer sea-ice
extent of the past several decades, reaching levels not predicted
to occur until mid-century. Scientists already predict this year's
sea-ice minimum could shatter the record previously set in 2007.
Several leading scientists now predict the Arctic Ocean could be
ice-free in the summer by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/g8-petition"&gt;Be part of the climate solution : Join the Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Support our work to secure the future of the polar bear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Endangered Species Act threatens Polar Bears</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/endangered-polar-bears150508/</url><text>
	For the last three years, the US Department of Interior has been dragging its feet when it comes to protecting the polar bear. It has now finally listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. This might seem like a victory but there are enough exemptions in this listing to leave the polar bear unprotected against its biggest threat, global warming.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar Bears on an ice shelf. Mother and cub.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of calculated delays and several lawsuits against
them, brought by Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defence Council
and the Center for Biological Diversity, the Bush administration
has listed the polar bear as threatened under the United States
Endangered Species Act (ESA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threatened listing under the ESA is supposed to provide broad
protection to polar bears. This includes a requirement that United
States federal agencies ensure that any action carried out,
authorised, or funded by the United States government will not
"jeopardise the continued existence" of polar bears, or adversely
modify their critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the decision comes with a big catch: an exemption
(technically known as a "4(d) exemption") for global warming
pollution. Global warming is the biggest threat facing polar bears
and this exemption eliminates any real protection the listing could
have provided for the polar bear. It specifically says federal
agencies don't need to consider the impact of global warming
pollution on the polar bear. It gets worse: the listing also
proposes a separate regulation that reduces the protections the
polar bear would otherwise receive under the ESA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might look like a listing to protect the polar bear but
it's really just a way for the administration to protect the
interests of the oil and gas industry, as well as get away without
taking action on global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does the science say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision about whether or not to list a species under the ESA
is supposed to be based on the best available science. The best
available, most current science on the impact of global warming on
polar bears is clear: the species faces extinction because its
Arctic ice habitat is melting. Sea ice melts and refreezes
seasonally, but recent years have shown a smaller area of maximum
sea ice in the winter. Predictions about Arctic sea ice loss have
become worse with each passing year.  A few years ago, scientists
were predicting the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer as
early as 2100, then that prediction was moved up to 2050, then 2040
and 2030.  Late last year, one leading scientist predicted the
Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summer as soon as 2012. It seems
clear that the pace of global warming in the Arctic is outrunning
predictions and is happening faster than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greycenter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have been following this issue for quite some time, and I
have seen firsthand the impacts of global warming in the Arctic.
I've been in Alaska's Beaufort Sea when the sea ice retreated so
far offshore that a lone polar bear was stranded in open water,
swimming for what little ice it could find in search of its ringed
seal prey that were hundreds of miles away at the ice edge.   That
bear was not long for this world, and the image haunts me every
time I read another grim report about the plight of polar bears in
our warming world," said Melanie Duchin, a global warming
campaigner for Greenpeace US, based in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25177/polar-bear-on-sea-ice.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the US Geological Survey predicted that by 2050, two
thirds of the world's polar bears would disappear, including all of
the polar bears in the United States. Scientists are witnessing
evidence that polar bears are already in real trouble. Reduced food
supplies due to global warming has resulted in polar bears actually
resorting to cannibalism in the north coast of Alaska and Canada.
Scientists with the US Minerals Management Service documented the
drowning of at least four polar bears in September 2004, when the
sea ice retreated a record 160 miles off the state's northern
coast. Just last week, scientists in Alaska reported that fewer
polar bear yearlings are making it to maturity. The polar bear
population in Western Hudson Bay of Canada has declined from
approximately 1200 bears in 1987, to 1,100 bears in 1995, and then
to fewer than 950 bears in 2004 due to ice loss. Arctic sea ice
loss set a record low in 2007.  This year, the sea ice melt season
is already shaping up to break the record set in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Polar bears and sea ice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on
the sea ice for all of their essential needs, including hunting
their prey. The rapid warming of the Arctic and melting of the sea
ice poses a serious threat to polar bears. The polar bear could be
the first mammal to lose 100 percent of its habitat to global
warming.  As the ice continues to disappear, so will the polar
bear. The only way to save the polar bear is to stop global warming
and protect their sea ice habitat from melting away, and the only
way to do that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the Bush administration is ignoring the science that
is staring it in the face: global warming is threatening polar
bears with extinction. The federal government's press release
carried the headline, "Secretary Kempthorne Announces Decision to
Protect Polar Bears under Endangered Species Act," but it's clearly
mistitled. It would have been more aptly written if it had said,
"Secretary Kempthorne Announces Decision to Protect Oil and Gas
Industry."  Exempting global warming pollution caused by unabated
oil and gas drilling spells doom for the polar bear, pure and
simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those reading this and thinking that, while saving the polar
bear is a laudable goal,  what's more important is drilling for
oil, jobs and the economy, consider these facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US will never be able to drill its way to energy
independence since it has only three to four percent of global oil
reserves, yet burns one-quarter of the world's oil.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Arctic is a harbinger for things to come at lower
latitudes. What we see now in the Arctic - unprecedented sea ice
loss and species threatened with extinction - will not be limited
to the Arctic.  Serious global warming impacts and species'
extinction will accelerate in the mid-latitudes as it is in the
Arctic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stalling action now means more disruption and economic cost
down the line. It's not just about polar bears and the Arctic, the
entire country will benefit if the government replaces dirty
sources of energy such as oil, gas and coal with cleaner, climate
friendly forms of energy like solar and wind.  Conservation can go
a long way toward cutting US energy needs as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Pacific islands act to save tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pacific-saves-tuna210508/</url><text>
	Finally, some good news for tuna stocks and a first step towards protecting the Pacific Commons for future generations! Eight Pacific island countries have taken the most significant action ever to combat overfishing in the region.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years fishing fleets from distant countries have plundered
the Pacific's tuna, riding roughshod over legitimate concerns of
Pacific island countries. In December last year, Japan, Taiwan,
Korea and mainland China all blocked conservation measures at the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting.
And as we have witnessed over the past two months at sea in the
Pacific Commons - their fleets are continuing to decimate the tuna
stocks and threaten the future of Pacific livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the tide has turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New rules &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new agreement, foreign fishing vessels licensed to
fish in the waters of eight Pacific island countries will be banned
from fishing in two regions of the Pacific Commons adjacent to
these countries. This is a giant stride towards these areas
becoming marine reserves and towards the protection of Pacific
tuna. This is exactly what we have been pushing for since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eight countries (Parties to the Nauru Agreement) include the
Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru,
Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Most of the
tuna stocks from the Pacific, valued at US$ 3 billion a year, come
from the waters of these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25174/pacificmarinereserves.jpg" alt="Pacific Commons map" height="344" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;The orange areas mark the Pacific
Commons, which we want to see protected. The grey areas mark the
EEZs -- the national fishing waters. ©Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;No more throwing back the low-value fish &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign fishing vessels will also be required to retain their
full catches. This will cut the time fishing boats spend at sea and
the amount of tuna they catch. At present they throw away non-tuna
species to make room in their holds for the more valuable catch. It
will also be compulsory to carry fisheries observers on board at
all times. The use of fish aggregation devices (used to attract
juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna) will be banned in these
countries' waters for three months of the year. This is a
conservation measure designed to discourage harvesting of these
highly migratory species. These new rules will take effect on 15
June, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ship Esperanza has been in these areas for the last seven
weeks highlighting this issue. During this time we have taken
action against fishing fleets from Taiwan, Korea, the US and the
Philippines. We are calling for the these areas to become no-take
marine reserves and - politicians willing - that will become a
reality before the year is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will we see similar protection of other tuna fisheries? We're
working on it. Our ship Arctic Sunrise is on a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/" title="Med tour"&gt;three-month tour of the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;
demanding protection for the tuna fisheries there as well -- and
marine reserves are the answer again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25174/greenpeace-activists-demonstra.jpg" alt="Greenpeace in action to protect tuna" height="257" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First step towards healthy oceans for a healthy planet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting the Pacific Commons would be the first step toward
achieving our overall campaign goal:  to protect 40 percent of our
oceans with a global network of marine reserves.  Keeping the
oceans alive is essential to keeping our planet alive. As global
warming takes its toll on our already stressed marine ecosystems,
we need to protect the most vulnerable areas so they stand a better
chance of survival. In order to ensure the world has fish in the
future, we need marine reserves now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Dead oceans, dead planet. Sign our petition asking the United Nations to endorse protecting 40 percent of our oceans with no-take marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Help keep the Esperanza out on the high seas catching pirates and stopping overfishing. Every contribution helps.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	When you're in the business of saving the future - and you give yourself a specific deadline, such as 2050 - you need to make sure that every single day between then and now counts. Unfortunately, the G8 Summit was a waste of three whole days. Gathering in Toyako, Japan, G8 leaders offered nothing new on the food crisis, gave the wrong answer to rising oil prices and deferred climate action. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            George Bush attends his last ever G8 Summit - so it's not all bad news, then...
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our political advisor, Daniel Mittler, who was in Toyako
throughout, has been providing regular updates: from the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/rain_in_a_ski_resort_a_sad_but.html" target="_blank"&gt;wet and dismal start to the proceedings&lt;/a&gt;,
through the G8's &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/solving_the_food_crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;working lunches, working dinners and working
lunches while discussing the global food crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and to the
bitter end - a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/g8_climate_statement_this_is_a.html" target="_blank"&gt;final statement&lt;/a&gt; that showed they hadn't made
much progress whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned from the G8's three wasted days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1.    Never do today what you can keep putting off until
tomorrow...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global emissions have to start falling by 2015 and must be cut
by more than 50 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. With the
G8 countries accounting for 62 percent of greenhouse gas emissions,
it's clear that industrialised countries need to take the lead,
cutting emissions by at least 30 percent by 2020, and by between 80
and 90 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 in fact called on the world to aim for a 50 percent goal
- and not more - in 2050, and failed to give any clear commitments
on mid-term measures; this is simply not good enough. We need
action today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/ENVIRONMENT/EXTCC/0,,contentMDK:21713769~menuPK:4860081~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:407864,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;World Bank Climate Investment Funds&lt;/a&gt; that the
G8 has announced do not even exclude coal, the world's most
polluting energy source. Unless we end our addiction to fossil
fuels and start an energy revolution based on renewable energy and
energy efficiency now, the world of 2050 will be a nightmarish one
indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the G8 leaders have effectively done is postpone the
responsibility for tackling global climate change to future
generations; to the politicians who succeed them, and to the
children who will have to live in the nightmare world of 2050 as
envisioned by the G8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.    Never miss the opportunity - whatever the crisis - to
make a quick sale…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush, Berlusconi and others have used the G8 meeting to act as
lobbyists for their own energy giants, trying to sell dangerous,
expensive and uninsurable nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fact that nuclear energy today is based on risky
reactors, leads to proliferation and security hazards and produces
long lived deadly nuclear waste with no solution for its safe
disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that nuclear power will save the climate is absurd and
downright dangerous. We need solutions based on renewables and
energy efficiency to defeat climate change and ensure true energy
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not even as though it's difficult for the G8 to find these
solutions - we set it all out, loud and clear, for them in our &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25145/energyrevolutionreport.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; last year. Maybe
it's time for the G8 leaders to get their heads down into reading
this report, instead of having their heads in the (hopefully, not
mushroom-shaped) clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.    You can have your cake &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; eat it - so long as
it's genetically modified…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's said, "You are what you eat." Yet, the G8 continues to
support treating our soil like dirt, contaminating our water with
toxic chemicals and the planting of more GE crops that yield less
and fail under bad weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial agriculture has undermined global food security and
led us to a food crisis. Rather than shift public investment to
proven ecological methods that provide higher yields, better food
and more resilience to climate change, the G8 leaders repeat their
usual mantra that countries should rely on the global market for
their food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, Bush, Berlusconi and others have been pushing
for genetically engineered food as the solution to the food crisis.
They pretend that liberalising trade will lower food prices. It has
not and will not - all it will do is drive poor farmers, especially
those in the developing world, off their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need farming that is ecological and biodiverse, rather than
continuing with chemical-intensive farming or pursuing the false
promise of genetic engineering. We need public investment in
research and development on ecological and climate change resilient
farming; the end of funding for GE crops and the prohibition of
patents on seeds; and the phasing out of the most toxic chemicals
and the elimination of environmentally-destructive agricultural
subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time for G8 leaders to admit that their old policies have
failed and that they need to start building a trade system based on
equity and sustainability; that 'business as usual' is not an
option. Instead, they fell back on their usual ritual of calling
for a swift end to the Doha Round of trade talks, failing to
recognise that further trade liberalisation will spell disaster for
poor people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Daniel Mittler's reports show, the G8 leaders had plenty of
food…but little thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4.    Acknowledge the problem, and hopefully it'll go
away…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 acknowledged there are unsustainable biofuels - but
didn't do anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this inaction even more land will be diverted away from
food production - mandatory biofuel targets in developed countries
need to be suspended and legislation introduced to ensure biofuel
production does not threaten food security, particularly in
developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And due to this inaction, even more forests will be felled -
increasing global climate change.  Protecting intact forests is
crucial for preserving biodiversity and combating climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is running out, but the answer to the world's transport
needs does not lie with unsustainable biofuels. In order to satisfy
the rich world's addiction to cars, instead we are simply driving
deforestation, driving the food crisis and driving climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the G8 may have driven through all the climate red
lights and stop signs in Toyako.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5.    Always look on the bright side of life…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Arctic ice is melting, the G8 froze into inaction.
Instead of protecting the climate, the G8 effectively protected the
interests of industry, most notably the nuclear and GE industries.
We're no further forward than where we were a year ago, at the last
G8 meeting in Heiligendamm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;But, the one good thing about this G8
meeting is that it was US President George W. Bush's last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any money from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace blockades Australian coal-fired power station</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-blockades-australia/</url><text>
	Greenpeace activists, including an ex-miner from the Hunter Valley, blockaded Australia's most polluting coal-fired power station to call for an Energy [R]evolution. Entering the plant in the early hours of the morning, 16 activists were able to lock themselves to the conveyors that distribute the coal.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist inside Eraring Power Station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the last activists had been removed from the site,
coal supply had been halted for about five hours - for every hour
supply was stopped, we prevented 2000 tonnes of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; from being released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd's turn to act on
climate change and energy. Greenpeace's Australian supporters are
being asked to sign a petition urging Rudd to commit to phasing out
dirty coal and building a clean, safe and reliable energy future
for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Eraring power station?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia-Pacific's climate and energy campaigner,
Simon Roz, explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to stop fuelling climate change when creating
electricity. Eraring is old and inefficient - it's Australia's
dirtiest coal-fired power plant, sending nearly 20 million tonnes
of greenhouse pollution into the atmosphere every year. It's one of
the eight coal-fired power stations in New South Wales responsible
for half the state's and 13% of Australia's greenhouse
pollution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the activists blockading the coal conveyor was Graham
Brown, a retired Hunter Valley coal miner. He said, "I feel very
strongly that we must start making the transition from coal-power
to renewable energy. Coal communities have been taken advantage of
by coal companies and governments. Renewable energy is the future,
and it's bright. Workers must be retrained and re-skilled so that
they don't miss out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable technology is already there, we don't have to wait 20
years for it - but we need a transition mechanism in place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action came in advance of Australian government's climate
change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, delivering his draft review
on climate change. Any urgent action to be taken on climate change
must include policies that support renewables to replace dirty
coal-fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon Roz says, "Renewable energy can replace coal-fired
power and would be a huge step forward in reducing emissions in
line with Professor Garnaut's recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is just the latest of many countries in which
Greenpeace has released national Energy [R]evolution reports
showing how renewables combined with energy efficiency, can provide
all of that country's energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace released its global &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energyrevolutionreport/" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The
scenario shows how renewables can replace coal by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Energy [R]evolutionary!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;Send a message to world leaders who are meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU and become energy [r]evolutionaries! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

<item><language>en</language><title>Facing up to illegal forest destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-illegal-timber-law-020708/</url><text>
	Illegal logging often happens in far-off places that are all too easily ignored. That's why we have brought the problem to the heart of Europe - with a 12-metre Amazon tree trunk placed in Brussels to highlight the role of Europe in fuelling the destruction of the world's rainforests.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/eu-forests-law-amazon.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/eu-forests-law-amazon.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists take the message "Ban illegal timber" to the EU Commission Headquarters.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed Brazilian artist Siron Franco has installed nine video
monitors into the trunk of an Amazon tree that comes from an area
in Brazil where illegal logging is rampant. The tree has been
placed outside the European Commission's headquarters and contrasts
images of the natural beauty of the rainforest with the ongoing
destruction caused by illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is part of our ongoing campaign to force the EU
to introduce a new timber law. This would see a long overdue ban on
illegal timber being sold in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Environment Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, and other EU
politicians are planning to visit the tree, where our activists
will present them with a plywood postcard reading: 'Stop the
chainsaw massacre! Adopt EU timber law now' to remind them why it
is vital to protect the world's last remaining rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Europe buys millions of tonnes of timber from
areas such as the Amazon, South East Asia and the Congo, where
illegal and destructive logging is rampant. As a result, customers
in Europe, buying products like garden furniture, paper tissues,
and construction materials, are unwitting accomplices in the
destruction of the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, the EU has been promising to introduce
new laws against illegally harvested timber, but those companies
profiteering from illegal logging have been obstructing the efforts
being made by the European Commission. However, on July 23, the
European Commission will finally vote on whether to adopt a new
law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the European Commission hasn't got much choice
if it is serious about tackling climate change. We urgently need to
stop destroying the world's forests. Practices such as illegal and
destructive logging drive deforestation, which in turns leads to
the dramatic loss of species and accounts for one fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our supporters have been instrumental in making sure
that the issue hasn't fallen off of the Commission's agenda. Since
June 17, over &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;
65,000 letters have been sent&lt;/a&gt; to the EU President, José Manuel
Barroso. Progressive companies working in the timber industry have
also been pushing for the new law - they are suffering at the hands
of rogue businesses involved in illegal and destructive logging who
undercut prices, make sustainable wood less competitive and harm
the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU already has strict controls on illegal music, software
and films. It's high time timber stolen from the world's last
rainforests was just as strictly controlled as pirate CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;Please write to President Barroso today for a strong EU timber law.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Global protest continues to mount with protests and vigils in front of Japanese embassies around the world and more than 180,000  190,000 200,000 letters being sent to the Japanese government demanding the release of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki -- the Tokyo Two. A network of Japanese lawyers have called the arrests a violation of human rights and a challenge to the freedom of expression in Japan.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists conduct peaceful protests at Japanese embassies around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru have been under arrest since the 20th of June,
held without charge. On Tuesday, July 1st, a hearing will be held
on whether they will be detained for a further ten days without
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru exposed a whale-meat embezzlement scandal on
May 15th by presenting a box of whale meat stolen by crew of
Japan's so-called "scientific whaling" fleet, to the Tokyo Public
Prosecutor along with a dossier documenting how they obtained it. 
The scam, in which prime cuts of whale meat are smuggled off the
ship by crewmembers and sold outside official channels, appears to
have been running for years with the full awareness of the
officials that conduct the whaling expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="slideshowmx" align="middle" height="311" width="430"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme is funded by taxpayers, at a cost
of 500 million yen a year (4.7 million)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosecutor's office took up an investigation, but concluded
there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges against any of
the crew or whaling officials. The only consequences in the case
were for the Greenpeace activists, who intercepted a box of meat as
evidence, and were arrested in dramatic raids on their homes and
offices, conducted by around 40 police officers in front of
television cameras.  The police seized documents, computers, cell
phones, and the Greenpeace Japan supporter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;"The response by the Japanese authorities can only
be described as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;excessive, unjust and politically motivated...Rather than trying
to silence those who point out corruption, the police should be
investigating the government officials, whaling fleet operators and
staff who smuggle whale meat from the so-called scientific
programme funded by Japanese taxpayers and sell it for profit. This
and the ongoingwhaling operation in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is where the forces of justice should be focussed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="source"&gt;Gerd Leipold, Executive Director, Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other voices in Japan are saying that the arrest was a warning
to other activist groups that as the G8 approaches, voices of
dissent in Japan will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=4853" target="_blank"&gt;Kyodo&lt;/a&gt; Reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;    While he disagrees with
Greenpeace's anti-whaling stance, journalist Takao Saito said the
way the police arrested the two men and the way they investigated
the group was heavy-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"(Greenpeace) is functioning as a
whistleblower in our society so the authorities should give them a
fair hearing to what they have to say."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WATCH, a network of laywers keeping an eye on human rights in
Japan in the run up to the G8, issued a &lt;a href="http://watch08summit.blogspot.com/2008/06/we-strongly-protest-against-detention.html"&gt;
statement&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"The arrest of the two activists is
not only a human rights violation with regard to the unjustifiable
arrest, detention and investigation, but also a challenge against
the freedom of expression. Police repression against the activists'
denunciation obstructs the legitimate activities of both Japanese
civil society and international society and is therefore
internationally unacceptable and subject to global criticism as an
affront to humanity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supporters have launched protests from Budapest to
Sydney, Sao Paolo to Jakarta, Athens to Washington, and points in
between:&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers embarks on a synchronized propaganda campaign aligned with Alberta's "rebranding" of its oil-extracting tar sands project, Greenpeace has launched its own website to paint the greenwash in its true colour: a deep, oily black.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/"&gt;TravellingAlberta.com&lt;/a&gt;
is a tongue-in-cheek travel site that uses humour to communicate a
very serious issue to Canadian and international audiences about
the destructive nature of the world's largest industrial
development. The website showcases  some of the unique attractions
that await travelers to Alberta: Black sand beaches, toxic lakes
and clearcut forests. Until now, this kind of vacation destination
was merely the stuff of science fiction; but now, it can be
experienced first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We thought we'd help the province and the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers  with their "rebranding" campaign by
bringing Alberta's newest tourist attractions to the world's
doorstep. Any visitor to the Alberta tar sands can see the
pollution, smell the sulfur, taste the toxins and hear the air
cannons - we're saving them the trip," says Mike Hudema, a tar
sands campaigner with Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Premier Ed Stelmach and theCanadian Association of Petroleum
Producers can spend 25 million dollars of tax payers' money trying
to cleanup the image of the tar sands, but this development is
still dirty, ugly and foul. That money would be much better spent
cleaning up the tar sands themselves, rather than just the global
image."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a real cleanup of the area is still a way off, the
current state of northern Alberta offers a rare treat for the
seasoned globetrotter who is craving something new. A seemingly
endless expanse of bitumen-laden sands - coupled with the powerful
scent of oil from refineries wafting through the hazy air - makes
Northern Alberta a truly one-of-a-kind destination. As families
make their vacation plans, TravellingAlberta.com offers these
adventure tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversion surfing:&lt;/b&gt; Catch a wave, Alberta-style, and join
Big Oil in taking advantage of the nearly 92 billion gallons of
water diverted from provincial rivers each year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal sightings:&lt;/b&gt; Moose playing in tailings ponds, loons
drenched in tar and ducks sinking in oil: it's not everywhere that
you can see some of Canada's most prized wildlife in these unique
settings. Hurry though! They're going fast!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tailings sailing:&lt;/b&gt; Come enjoy the vast lakes of toxic
water, so big they're visible to the naked eye from space! Chase
that horizon, but be careful not to capsize!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun in the sun:&lt;/b&gt; Forget Cancun, Alberta is sizzling!
Boasting more greenhouse gas emissions than Canada's three other
most populous provinces combined, it's really heating up out
here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will promote the website internationally, calling on
visitors to share the site with friends and to write Premier Ed
Stelmach, Travel Minister Cindy Ady and Prime Minister Stephen
Harper to demand they put the brakes on tar sand development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/"&gt;TravellingAlberta.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/book_today.php"&gt;Tell the Alberta and Canadian government that it's time to put the brakes on the Tar Sands and save the Alberta's beautiful environment!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Greenpeace would not exist without the financial support of nearly 3 million donors worldwide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior is blockading coal shipments at the Pagbilao coal-fired power plant to protest the plant's impending expansion.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-greenpeace-activist-onboard.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace activist onboard the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior looks on as the vessel blocks coal shipments at the Pagbilao coal-fired power plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href="#video"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;  |  &lt;a href="#photos"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;
]&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our action comes on the eve of the G8 Environment Ministers
Meeting in Japan. The richest industrialised countries in the world
are gathering in Kobe to discuss solutions to climate change from
24-26 May. Ending the use of coal needs to top the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-hundred-fifty kilometers southwest of Manila, the Rainbow
Warrior is anchored alongside the coal ship Medi Firenze, which is
unloading a cargo of coal at the plant's dock. This prevents a
bigger shipment of coal - from the 223-meter vessel Sam John Spirit
standing by to unload - from approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A giant banner reading "Quit coal" is strung between the Rainbow
Warrior's masts to drive home the message that the Philippine
government should stop building and expanding harmful coal-fired
power plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update - 25 May -&lt;/b&gt; We've ended our protest on a high note.
Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri sent a message of support to the Rainbow
Warrior saying, "I will file a resolution in the Senate seeking a
halt in the construction of new coal fired power plants in the
country."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippines at risk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is among the countries most vulnerable to rising
sea levels, more frequent cyclones and other devastating effects
from climate change. The coal plant's planned expansion would mean
an additional 5 million tons of climate-wrecking carbon dioxide
pumped into the atmosphere every year - double the plant's current
production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the expansion is not the only concern. The government is
currently planning to build eight new coal-fired power
stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time when we need to be doing everything we can to reduce
our emissions, we are importing more and more fossil fuel that we
don't need and which will bring consequences we simply cannot
afford. The banks and companies that fund our coal industry need to
realise that what looks like investment to them is going to mean
destruction for us," said Jasper Inventor, Climate Campaigner with
Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines have the capacity to produce 54 percent more
electricity than they use. However problems with the electricity
grid means the excess goes to waste rather than towards powering
people's homes, villages and towns. The government needs to invest
in resolving the problem of power transmission, rather than new
coal fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="video" title="video" name="video"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Governor calls for "coal free
zone"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government's plans are not only out of step with the global
fight to tackle climate change. Governor of Albay province in
Luzon, Joey Sarte Salceda, recently announced the province a coal
free zone. "Albay is taking a bold step .... by declaring ... a 'No
to mining and coal free zone'. We believe there is no place for
coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no
place for coal in Albay," he said. "I call on other nations,
particularly the developed nations, to reject coal." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector produces two-thirds of the world's climate
change-causing greenhouse gas emissions, with coal-fired power
stations the greatest offenders.  The Philippines already has eight
coal-fired power stations, which account for as much as 36 percent
of the country's energy emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clearly the national government is not serious about addressing
climate change," said Jasper Inventor. "If the government wants to
do right, the first thing on its list should be to quit coal and
ensure an end to coal construction and expansion. The government
must start phasing out of this dirty and dangerous power source
while increasingly tapping clean, safe, renewable energy. 
Renewable energy sources are abundant in the Philippines, the only
thing we need more of is the political will to deploy them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="photos" title="photos" name="photos"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is in the Philippines to spearhead the
Greenpeace "Quit Coal Tour" in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Our
tour aims to promote solutions to stop climate change - an energy
revolution away from the use of climate-damaging coal, and a
massive shift to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/quit-coal/take-action"&gt;Take action by spreading the word!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation. We do not accept money from government or corporations. That's why our financial supporters are our lifeblood. You can offer a monthly, annual or one-off gift.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Mister Splashy Pants just heard that two of his Greenpeace pals have been arrested.  He, too, is amazed that they've been locked up for exposing the truth -- and he's going to do something about it. Are you?

        &lt;p&gt;
            Whalebreak: Free the Tokyo Two
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace activists expose an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;
embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; involving whale meat which is costing
Japanese taxpayers millions of yen. Forty cops swoop down on the
Greenpeace offices to arrest the Greenpeace activists instead of
the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global storm follows: hundreds of thousand of supporters &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;write to the Japanese
government&lt;/a&gt;. Diplomatic protests are lodged by whale-friendly
governments. Vigils and demonstrations are held outside Japanese
embassies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story prompts people all around the world to take
extraordinary action. Now another hero steps up to do what must be
done. Help Mister Splashy Pants free the Tokyo Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is this Mister Splashy Pants dude, you ask? In the real
world, he's a humpback whale we &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
tracked with a satellite tag&lt;/a&gt; heading from the Solomon Islands
toward the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary -- that safe haven in
which the Japanese government kills around 1,000 whales every year
for "scientific research." He was named in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Splashy_Pants"&gt;online
competition&lt;/a&gt; in which his share of the 100,000 votes clobbered
all rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Japanese whalers were heading toward the Southern
Ocean planning to add humpbacks to the whale species they kill
every year. Public pressure from whale supporters worldwide brought
diplomatic protest to bear, however, and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
Japanese backed down on plans to kill humpbacks&lt;/a&gt; -- for now,
anyway. (They still kill minke and fin whales, but our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/551-whales-too-many-140408/"&gt;
direct non-violent actions helped ensure they killed fewer of them
this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants was saved by whale activists like you,
Junichi and Toru. So he reckoned it was time to return the favour.
Help him out by spreading the word: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;Free the Tokyo
Two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of getting the electronics
industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want
manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We
want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers
scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's
gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 the Guide is now on its 8th
edition. It ranks the top market leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games console markets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals and take-back. It has been a key
driving force in getting many of the companies to make significant
improvements to their environmental policies. New to this edition
are &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/improved-criteria-explained/"&gt;
criteria&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of electronics companies on
tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are scored on disclosure of their greenhouse gas
emissions, commitment for absolute cuts in their own emissions and
support for the mandatory global emissions reductions that are

of each company's product range is assessed to see how far they
exceed the current de-facto global standard, the US Environmental
Protection Agency's &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home.index" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Star&lt;/a&gt;. Energy Star sets minimum standards
for energy efficiency for many types of &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductCategory&amp;amp;pcw_code=HEF" target="_blank"&gt;electronic products&lt;/a&gt;. The overall percentage of
renewable energy in a companies total energy use is also
assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector
currently accounts for two percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions, equal to the aviation industry. As one of the most
innovative and fastest growing industries, the biggest electronics
companies must show leadership in tackling climate change by
reducing both their direct and indirect climate change
footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our international toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska has noticed
stark contrasts while compiling the Guide: "Electronics giants pay
attention to environmental performance on certain issues, while
ignoring others that are just as important. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt;, for example, scores well on chemicals and energy
criteria, but scores a zero on e-waste since it has no global
take-back polices. Philips would score higher if it took
responsibility for its own branded e-waste and established
equitable global take-back schemes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies score well on energy efficiency as their products
comply and exceed Energy Star standards. The best performers on
energy efficiency are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sony-Ericsson-8"&gt;
Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electrnoics-Apple-8"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt;, with all of their models meeting, and many exceeding,
Energy Star requirements. Sony Ericsson stands out as the first
company to score almost top marks on all of the chemicals criteria.
With all new Sony Ericsson models being PVC-free, the company has
also met the new chemicals criterion in the ranking, having already
banned antimony, beryllium and phthalates from models launched
since January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple missed a big chance to advance its score by not improving
the environmental performance of the new version of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies that promote their 'green' policies come up short
when measured against global standards of measuring impacts on
climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Dell-8"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt; scores relatively poorly while Toshiba, Samsung and LGE
score close to, or zero, on climate change criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the games console makers, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Microsoft-8"&gt;
Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; drops to second bottom of the Guide with a low score
on climate criteria. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Nintendo-8"&gt;
Nintendo's score&lt;/a&gt; increases slightly with some improvement on
toxic chemicals and climate policy. However, even Nintendo's
relatively energy efficient Wii console does not meet Energy Star
standards that cover minimum &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers"&gt;
energy efficiency standards for PCs and consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real green leaders?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most companies now scoring less than 5/10, only a company
that rises to the challenge of phasing out toxic chemicals,
increasing the recycling rate of e-waste, using recycled materials
in new products and reducing their impact on climate change can
seriously hope to make the claim of being green.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Australian smokestack occupied for 33 hours</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/swanbank-coal-occupation140708/</url><text>
	Over the weekend, four activists from Greenpeace Australia occupied the top of a 140-metre high smokestack for 33 hours enduring near freezing temperatures overnight. They began the two-hour descent yesterday, at Swanbank B coal fired power plant near Brisbane, leaving a message for Australia's leaders - "Go Solar!"- painted on the side of the smoke stack. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists abseiled off the side of a 140-metre coal smokestack and painted the message "Go Solar".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon descending, Greenpeace energy campaigner Julien Vincent,
who was part of the climbing team, said they sent the message that
the situation is urgent and we have to act fast on climate change.
This means revolutionising the way Australia generates energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists climbed the stack at dawn on Friday, 11 July and
spent a night up the top in near-freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1VI3NhAAofA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why did we do this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did this to get the message out that Australia urgently needs
to cut greenhouse gas emissions. They must start replacing old and
dirty coal fired power stations, like this one at Swanbank, with
true clean renewable energy, like solar. It is tragic that
Queensland, with the best solar resources in the world, is not a
leader in the booming global renewable energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;33 hours for a renewable energy future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists' occupation of the 37-year-old Swanbank B
coal-fired plant began at 5.30am on Friday 11 July. Of 13 activists
who entered the plant yesterday morning, nine were arrested before
they started climbing the stack. The remaining four were arrested
after 33 hours up top of the major climate changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swanbank B is responsible for more than two million tonnes of
carbon emissions a year - that's the annual pollution of 300,000
cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The world's best solar resource&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If every home in Queensland switched to solar water heating,
Swanbank B could be switched off. We want a commitment from
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to close Swanbank by the next
election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is way behind many other countries in developing
renewable energy. In the next 18 months Spain will roll out enough
solar thermal power to replace Swanbank B power station four times
over. If Australia makes the right choices it could become a
powerhouse for renewable energy manufacturing and technological
development, creating thousands of new jobs and investment
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Government's climate change advisor, Professor
Ross Garnaut, says that if Australians do not successfully combat
climate change, theGreat Barrier Reef will die and they will lose
50,000 jobs and $5 billion in tourism dollars each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs in coal can be replaced by jobs in renewable energy. There
is no way to replace the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Philippine's leg of Quit Coal tour wraps up</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philippine-s-leg-of-quit-coal/</url><text>
	“We believe there is no place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no place for coal in Albay”That was the statement of Governor Joey Sarte Salceda, setting the tone for our one month Quit Coal tour of the Philippines. Since the Rainbow Warrior arrived in the country we’ve taken our Quit Coal message to the places it needed to be heard, and generated real progress on the ground and in the corridors of power.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers light candles in front of Jaro Cathedral - sending a message supporting Iloilo people's demand to the Philippine government for a cleaner, safer, future powered by renewable energy. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pagbilao, we went into action to blockade shipments of coal.
The peaceful actions of our local activists and the crew of the
Rainbow Warrior helped secure commitment from leading politicians
to bring the Renewables Energy Bill to the floor of the Philippine
Senate. The bill has already been passed by the Philippine
Congress, but had been ignored by the Senate. Now we've secured the
support of influential senators, including the chair of the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a coal-free Philippines.
The threat of climate change demands a shift towards a sustainable,
clean and low carbon future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taguig City, we painted the Quit Coal message onto the
driveway of the Department of Energy. Head of that department is
Secretary Reyes, who as chairman of the Presidential Task Force on
Climate Change should have known better than to sanction the
construction or expansion of nine coal fired power stations in a
country with huge renewable energy potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iloilo City, we constructed a climate camp to show our
support for the residents of Iloilo City who are fighting to avoid
the construction of a new coal fired power plant. At events
organised with the Catholic Church and local civil society group
RISE (Responsible Illongos for Sustainable Energy) we brought home
the message that the Philippines is one of the countries most at
risk from global warming, and that burning coal is the single
biggest source of CO2 emissions and a major cause of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we moved our camp to the site of the proposed coal fired
power station to bring our message to the local communities who
will be affected by the new power plant. Tensions ran high when
workers from Panay Power Corporation acting under orders from their
management tried to dismantle the camp and cut off the activists
from the outside world.  Our response was to take our protest to
Metrobank, one of the largest banks in the Philippines and the
owners of Panay Power Corporation. This is just the beginning of a
grassroots campaign to put pressure on the financiers behind the
coal plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour concluded with visits to Antique and Boracay. In
Antique local governor Salvacion Z Perez declared her province coal
free saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earth has provided us with renewable energy. It is time to
harness this energy to generate electricity, and it is our aim to
drastically [reduce] and ultimately stop the use of fossil fuels
especially coal as source of energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boracay, we launched our "Save the climate, Save Boracay"
project, part of an initiative to enlist top island destinations in
South East Asia to reduce their carbon footprints. The people of
Boracay face inundation from rising sea levels, but are determined
to set an example to the world with their use of renewable energy
and efficient energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior carries the Quit Coal message on to Thailand
now, but work in the Philippines continues through our South East
Asia office and allies in civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;We're sending a message to world leaders who will be meeting at the G8 summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU by becoming energy [r]evolutionaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

<item><language>en</language><title>Japan holds whale activists without charge (Updated)</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/</url><text>
	Japanese police have arrested two Greenpeace activists for exposing a whale meat scandal involving the government-sponsored whaling programme. The two activists, Junichi Sato, 31, and Toru Suzuki, 41, are being investigated for allegedly stealing a box of whale meat which they presented as evidence.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whale campaign coordinator Junichi Sato, with the whale meat that was stolen from Japanese taxpayers, and which he provided as evidence to the government -- only to be arrested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="Box green" style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Latest updates and background on the whale meat
scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box of the most expensive cuts of whale meat had been
illicitly removed by crew of the Nisshin Maru, the whaling factory
ship, following this year's Southern Ocean whale hunt. Its contents
were marked "cardboard" and it was shipped to a private address.
Tracked by our investigators, it was intercepted and turned over to
the Public Prosecutor in Tokyo, as evidence of wide-scale
corruption at the heart of the whaling operation in the Southern
Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We requested an investigation into the scandal, and the Public
Prosecutor agreed that there was sufficient evidence of
wrongdoing.   In light of evidence that the operators of the
whaling operation were aware of the scandal and did nothing, we
asked that the investigation not focus on crew, but on the
bureaucrats who run the whaling programme at public expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE 21 June 2008&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo District Prosecutor Office announced that it has been
unable to find evidence of the embezzlement and that the
investigation into crew and whaling officials has been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this has been a difficult investigation for the
Prosecutor's Office when the level of corruption runs so deep in
the whaling industry, an industry backed by powerful forces within
the government. However, some questions remain unanswered: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Kyodo Senpaku, the company that operates the whaling ships,
was legally giving out whale meat to the crew then why did they
change their story three times in almost as many days?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why did the crew lie about the contents of the boxes containing
the meat, claiming that they contained cardboard when in fact they
were stuffed full of prime whale meat cuts worth tens of thousands
of dollars?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And why, before the scandal was exposed, did an official of the
Japanese Fisheries agency claim that whale meat was never given to
crew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25156/whale-meat-scandal-dossier.pdf" class="act"&gt;Read the full dossier of evidence, and decide for
yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 22 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; At a hearing this morning, the "Tokyo
Two" have been ordered held another ten days without charge. We are
appealing that decision tomorrow. In the meantime, our lawyer
believes that the number of people who have written demanding their
release -- nearly 50,000 at this writing -- could help their case
considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 23 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; Our appeal has been rejected, and
Junichi and Toru have been ordered to spend a further 9 days in
jail without charge. Under Japanese law, they can be held for up to
23 days without charge. More than 100,000 people have now taken our
global cyberaction demanding their release.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 27 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; Greenpeace has begun a series of
actions at Japanese embassies around the world protesting the
detention of Junichi and Toru. 170,000 people have now written to
demand their relase.  Please, if you have not already done so, take
action and encourage others to do so as well: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="video" title="video" name="video"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 10th, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junich and Toru are still in custody, 20 days after their arrest
- stay tuned for further updates. Many &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/tokyo-two-statement-of-concer/"&gt;
International Non-Governmental Organisations have signed a
Statement of Concern&lt;/a&gt; about the situation. Almost a quarter of a
million people have &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;sent an email to the
Japanese government to demand their release&lt;/a&gt;. Have you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Japanese police arrested the Greenpeace activists in a
show of force, occupying the Greenpeace offices with 40 police for
more than 10 hours while they seized computers, documents, and cell
phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme costs the Japanese taxpayer 500
million yen per year (around 4.7 million US dollars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the backlash," said Greenpeace Executive Director Jun
Hoshikawa. "We've uncovered a scandal involving powerful forces in
the Japanese government that benefit from whaling, and it's not
surprising they are striking back. What is surprising is that these
activists, who are innocent of any crime, would be arrested for
returning whale meat that was stolen from Japanese taxpayers. In
whose interest were these arrests made? Because it would appear to
us that this is an intimidation tactic by the government agencies
responsible for a scandal." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intimidation tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first news that an arrest was imminent came from Japanese
television stations. Someone leaked the information to ensure
images of Greenpeace activists under arrest appeared on news
reports in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/release-our-activists/"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2008/6/whale-arrest430.gif" width="430" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 40 police officers raided our offices and the homes of
the activists, and spent 10 hours seizing cell phones, documents,
and computers, despite the fact that we had documented every step
of how we obtained the whale meat, turned the full dossier over
with the evidence, and made ourselves available to police to help
with the investigation at any time. A simple phone call could have
brought Junichi and Toru to the police station. Instead, the
government made a public spectacle of shutting Greenpeace down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The investigation  &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our four-month undercover investigation revealed evidence of an
embezzlement ring involving crew members on board the Nisshin Maru,
who were openly taking the best cuts of whale meat during the
so-called scientific hunt, smuggling it ashore disguised as
personal luggage and then passing it to traders for illegal
sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from information given by former and current Kyodo
Senpaku employees, we documented the off-loading of smuggled whale
meat into a special truck, in full view of Kyodo Senpaku officials
and crew members when the Nisshin Maru docked on April 15th, this
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consignment was documented by our team once it left the ship
and tracked to a depot in Tokyo. One of four boxes destined for the
same private address was then intercepted in order to verify the
contents and establish the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consignment notes claimed the box contained "cardboard" but
in reality it held 23.5kg of salted 'prime' whale meat, worth up to
US$3,000. One informer told Greenpeace that dozens of crew take as
many as 20 boxes each.  One crewmember was overheard to claim he
had built a house on the proceeds from his whale-meat sales over
the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Official denials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 8th, before the scandal broke, Takahide Naruko, an
official with the Japanese FisheriesAgency, was asked by
investigators whether sailors "bring back somewhale meat as private
souvenirs," to which he replied "Of course not,"explaining that the
distribution of whale meat was only throughofficial channels, at a
price set by the Fisheries Agency to offset thecosts of the
publicly funded whaling programme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the revelations, Kyodo Senpaku, the company that runs
the whaling ship, also at first denied that any whale meat was
beinggiven away or sold outside official channels, then changed
their storyto claim that some "souvenirs" were given to crew
members.  Even so,these souvenirs were described to be a few kilos
of frozen whale meat-- very different from 23.5 kilos of prime cuts
uncoveredby Greenpeace, which the crew salt-pickle in their
cabins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 28th, an editorial in Asahi Shinbum noted
thecontradiction between claims by the Institute for Cetacean
Researchthat souvenirs were being handed out, and the claims by
Kyodo Senpakuthat they were not.  The newspaper called the
"contrived explanations"suspicious and asked for a full
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is
funded by the Japanese taxpayers, including the Greenpeace
activists who have been arrested, and they have a right to know who
is profiting from their money," said Mister Hoshikawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese whaling programme has been shamed internationally
for its lack of scientific credibility, now it is being shamed at
home as well for trying to hide the corruption, and now for taking
revenge on those who have exposed it. The Greenpeace activists
should be immediately released."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Japanese whaling fleet has again defied world opinion and resumed whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The Australian Customs vessel, the Oceanic Viking, reports that the Fisheries Agency of Japan’s whaling fleet has killed at least five whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner Sakyo Noda sends a message home by holding the Japanese symbol,'nise', meaning FAKE - against the hull of the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary had remained fatality free for the whales for two
weeks due to the Esperanza chasing the factory whaling ship, the
Nissin Maru, across the Southern Ocean for 8,000 km (5,000
miles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the factory ship, the rest of the whaling fleet were
unable to operate - bringing the entire whaling programme to a
halt. During the two weeks Greenpeace spent with the fleet more
than 100 whales were saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Esperanza gave chase across the Southern Ocean, media
coverage and public discussion on the whaling issue is now reaching
unprecedented levels in Japan, where Prime Minister Fukuda has been
forced to discuss the whaling issue in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more, Japanese taxpayers must be wondering why they
arefunding this fake research operation which produces no real
science,whale meat that no one wants to eat, and brings their
country intointernational disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign to end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is now moving from the open ocean to Japan where we are
calling on Canon - a company known for its support of conservation
issues, to publicly speak out against whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already over 44,000 concerned camera owners from around the
world have responded to our call to email Fujio Mitarai, the CEO of
Canon Japan. Fujio Mitarai is also the head of the influential
Nippon Keidanren (Japanese Business Federation).&lt;/p&gt;

	What's a polar bear to do?  Your ice is melting, politicians won't listen, and the government is dragging its feet about listing you as endangered...  Off to Washington, to start your own floating vigil!  Uh oh, here comes the fuzz.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/polar-bear-arrested.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist Tom Wetterer dressed in polar bear costume is arrested by outside the US Department of the Interior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, it was one of our activists in a costume - peacefully
protesting the Bush Administration's delay in issuing a final
Endangered Species Act listing for the polar bear due to global
warming. Yesterday, the activist, dressed in a polar bear suit, sat
quietly in a paddleboat in a park pond in front of the Department
of Interior. (Until the police took him to jail, where he remains
as of writing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Full steam ahead for new oil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Department of Interior is dragging their feet on
protecting polar bears, they are moving full steam ahead on plans
to drill for oil in prime polar bear habitat. New oil leases are
opening up in the Chukchi Sea and oil companies are lining up
quickly to obtain licenses to drill. A fifth of the remaining
Arctic polar bears depend on Chukchi Sea ice in their hunt for
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December of 2005, Greenpeace and two other conservation
groups sued the Bush administration when it missed its first legal
deadline to respond to the petition for an endangered species
listing. On December 27, 2006, the Service announced its proposal
to list the species as "threatened" and had one year to make a
final listing decision. The legal deadline for doing so was January
9, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="373" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XKbr-ZbRl-Y&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;border=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week it seems there is new evidence that the sea ice is
melting and that the polar bear's habitat is disappearing. The US
Geological Survey released a report this past September predicting
that if current warming projections continue, two-thirds of the
world's polar bears will likely be extinct by 2050, including all
of the polar bears in Alaska. With a timeline like that, it is hard
to understand how the polar bears aren't already protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why Listing is So Important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the polar bears were listed under the United States
Endangered Species Act - a safety net for plants and animals on the
brink of extinction - they would be granted a broad range of
protection. The protection would include a requirement that United
States federal agencies ensure that any action carried out,
authorized, or funded by the United States government will not
"jeopardize the continued existence" of polar bears, or adversely
modify their critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25221/polar-bear-doi.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/action/start/181/"&gt;Tell the US Congress not to wait for Bush - promote solutions to global warming now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EU renewables package a faltering step forward</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-renewable-energy-measures-a/</url><text>
	The EU is pushing ahead with measures to boost adoption of renewable energy and cut carbon emissions. Although they still don't go far enough, they are a step in the right direction.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/greenpeace-installs-solar-pane.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace installs solar panels on a school.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have been telling politicians all along that only
renewable technologies such as wind and solar power, alongside
improving energy efficiency, are the only real solution to climate
change. The penny dropped last year, when the EU announced that by
2020, a fifth of all energy would come from renewable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments were quick to show their green credentials by
signing up but now we want to see action to make sure the target is
achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large energy companies lobbied hard to introduce a virtual
trading system for renewable energy that would undermine the broad
development of renewable energy technologies. Luckily these efforts
to derail effective renewables support failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the European Commission has published targets setting out
the amount of renewable energy each country must generate to ensure
that the EU goal is met. The push on renewables is just one part of
a wider package to tackle climate change. They have also released a
breakdown of how much each country needs to cut their carbon
emissions by to make good the EU's promise to achieve a 20 percent
cut by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 per cent carbon emissions reductions are
needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But whilst these measures show that the EU is
thinking along the right lines, the targets themselves simply
aren't ambitious enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU targets fall short of what is needed to ensure that
global warming is kept below 2 degrees Celsius, what scientists
agree would be the tipping point for Earth's climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it isn't just environmental organisations that are saying
this. Scientists agree that a 20 percent cut in emissions just
isn't enough, and the European Commission themselves have openly
admitted that it falls short of what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the EU really wants to show leadership on climate change they
need to set realistic targets to cut emissions - and that means a
30 percent reduction by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU carbon credits system still flawed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climate proposals also set out new rules for emissions
trading. The EU set up the Emissions Trading Scheme in 2005 to
tackle emissions from industry. It means that companies have to
either reduce their emissions or buy carbon credits from other
companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has suggested ways to fix some major flaws in the
existing scheme, but again they've caved into industry pressure and
pulled back from making the scheme as effective as it needs to
be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies will still be given at least 40 percent of the carbon
permits that are available for free in 2013. This is no good. If
the scheme is to have any real teeth we need to make sure that the
polluter pays and that the real cost of carbon is accurately
reflected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU's climate package is a good start but if Europe really is
to show bold leadership on climate change they need to go much
further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Greenpeace email&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Sign up to find out how you can be part of real climate solutions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations.

	After three years of declining Amazon deforestation, rates of loss have now doubled to new record levels. Increased demand for products like soya and beef is driving the destruction.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/amazon100percent.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/9/amazon100percent.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            1,645 hectares of the Amazon that has been illegally deforested.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures released by the Brazilian authorities, show
deforestation rates of 3235km2 from August-December 2007. However,
as the tracking system used only shows preliminary deforestation
rates, the real figure is likely to be much higher. When more
detailed satellite images are analysed they are expected to reveal
that some 7,000 km2 of rainforest has been destroyed in just 5
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last three years the Brazilian Government has been
claiming credit for decreasing rates of Amazon deforestation.
However the falling price of soya and beef meant less pressure to
clear land for cattle ranching and soya plantations. Once demand
for these products rose again, many experts, including our own
Amazon team, warned that without decisive action from the Brazilian
government increased deforestation was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon Coordinator, Paulo Adario, saw warnings go largely
unheeded: "The Brazilian government can not claim to be caught by
surprise. Greenpeace warned throughout last year that increases in
the price of soya and beef meant that unless urgent counter
measures were taken deforestation would rise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If President Lula is serious about Brazil being a world leader
in the fight against deforestation then he must implement long-term
solid measures to ensure the Amazon cannot fall victim to
deforestation as a result of rising commodity prices."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it appears the Brazilian Government missed the
chance to effectively deal with the root causes of deforestation
over the last three years. It has just release a response to the
figures, announcing a mixture of new and repackaged old protection
measures. To date the Governments track record of enforcing
protection measures in the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazoforestresettlementscam210807"&gt;
Amazon has been woeful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Eating up the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 we exposed the role of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/mcamazon-060406/"&gt;
soya in the destruction of the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with the local
community of Santarém, Brazil. in July 2006, this lead to the soy
industry announcing a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/McVictory-200706"&gt;
landmark moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on forest clearing. It is vital that the
moratorium is now extended, as it is key to protecting the
Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the soya is exported to feed cattle and chickens for
meat production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amazon - vital for biodiversity and the climate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change, causing
about 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Brazil is the
world's 4th largest contributor to global warming, mainly due to
deforestation and land clearing in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind that alarming fact lie further drivers of Amazon
destruction. The US has launched huge, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/biofuels-not-so-green-150108/"&gt;
misguided subsidies for biofuels&lt;/a&gt; from maize. This has lead US
farmers to swap soya crops for maize hence helping drive up the
global price of soya. So a false climate solution in one part of
the world could be harming the global climate by helping encourage
new Amazon deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon needs the Brazilian Government to take decisive
action on the ground to halt deforestation. Globally tropical
forests are being felled for timber, and provide land for food and
most recently to make way for biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why we aim to ensure that deforestation is included in
the next phase of the Kyoto climate agreement extending beyond
2012. The decisions that governments make in the near future are
critical for securing the financing and capacity needed by
countries to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/indonesia-forests-climate/"&gt;
safeguard their tropical forests&lt;/a&gt; and to allow them to make a
serious contribution to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Greenpeace email&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Sign up to find out how you can be part of real climate solutions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on our millions of supporters worldwide to give whatever they can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bush - Monumental failure on climate change</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bush-monumental-failure/</url><text>
	In his State of the Union address last night, Bush made it clear what we've been saying all along: He has no plan to fight global warming, and is set on leaving a legacy of neglect, obstruction and destruction when it comes to climate change. On the eve of Bush’s bogus "Major Emitters Meeting", activists have taken to the US capitol to call attention to Bush’s disastrous policies and his plan to put a wrench in the UN's process.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists project a message to US President George Bush on the Washington Monument.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Major Economies Meeting a Sham&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being booed and jeered in Bali for trying to block a
successful outcome at the UN's meeting on climate change there last
month, the Bush administration continues to push its alternative
Major Economies Meeting (aka Major Emitters Meeting) this week in
Hawaii.  The administration hopes to use this side meeting as an
opportunity to replace the Kyoto Protocol's legally binding
emissions reductions with voluntary measures only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the President was serious about leading the fight on global
warming, he would stop trying to block the success of the UN
process and commit to a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in the US. 
Instead, he continues to keep the United States standing alone as
the only industrialized country that refuses to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Monumental Disaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists gathered on the National Mall the night
before the Major Economies Meeting and turned the Washington
Monument into a memorial to Bush's failed legacy on global warming.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists projected on the Washington Monument the message,
"U.S. Global Warming Plan: Hell and High Water", accompanied by an
image depicting rising sea levels at the base. Ironically, rising
sea levels from global warming threaten the very picturesque
islands, like Bali and Hawaii, the Bush administration is fond of
visiting to talk and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why "volunteerism" is a failed policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding emission targets for industrialized countries are the
basis of any meaningful global agreement to fight climate change.
Bush just wants to cross his fingers and hope that technological
progress saves us. All he is willing to tell the world is: "Hey,
guys, we will do our best". That will not be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the German Chancellor Angela Merkel observed last year, "I
don't believe that it's enough to just agree that everyone will do
their best. I don't believe that would yield an impressive
result."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And right she is. In 2002, Bush set a voluntary target of
reducing US energy intensity 18 percent by 2012. But greenhouse gas
emissions are projected to increase by 12 percent over that period.
Voluntarism simply doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the leading Democratic Presidential candidates and two of
the three top Republican candidates support binding limits on
greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system.  US
businesses also support binding emission caps. More than two dozen
of the largest US companies - such as Ford, General Electric, GM,
Dupont, Duke Energy and Chrysler - are calling for domestic cap and
trade legislation to start cutting American emissions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush is a 'lame duck' and will be out of office when the next
global climate agreement will be made in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world can't afford falling for Bush's Hawaii distraction.
Countries attending the meeting should resist Bush's ploy and
commit to real climate action now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries participating in Bush's meeting are: Japan,
France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, China, Canada, India,
Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesian, and
South Africa.  While the countries most at risk from impacts of
climate change - such as small island developing states like Tuvalu
- are not even invited to be at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace ship Esperanza continues to prevent whaling as we shadow the Japanese fleet's factory ship, Nisshin Maru. Our crew today sent a message, direct from the Southern Ocean, linking the scandal of whaling to a host of other scandals plaguing the government in Tokyo.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner Sakyo Noda sends a message home by holding the Japanese symbol,'nise', meaning FAKE - against the hull of the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On board an inflatable running parallel to the giant factory
ship, Greenpeace Japan whales campaigner &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2007/12/sakyo_campaigner.html"&gt;
Sakyo Noda&lt;/a&gt; held the Japanese &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji"&gt;kanji&lt;/a&gt; symbol &lt;span style="font-size: 150%"&gt;偽&lt;/span&gt; ("nise"), meaning "fake", next to
the word "RESEARCH" which has been painted by the Japanese
Fisheries Agency on the Nishim Maru's hull. Reflecting a growing
disquiet in Japanese society, &lt;span style="font-size: 150%"&gt;偽&lt;/span&gt; was voted the &lt;a href="http://no-sword.jp/blog/2007/12/2008_kanji_of_the_year.html"&gt;best
kanji symbol of the year&lt;/a&gt; for 2008. Its choice reflects recent
food mislabeling scandals, problems over political funds and faulty
pension records. Greenpeace Japan is now using it to show that the
use of taxpayers money to fund "scientific" whaling which yields no
useful science is yet another government scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vDlRgplqHA&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;
&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;
&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6vDlRgplqHA&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to self-censorship, until recently the whaling issue has not
been given much attention in the Japanese news media. Being against
whaling was thought to be against Japanese culture. This created a
"whalers' sanctuary" inside Japanese society that protected a small
number of bureaucrats, whalers and politicians who have vested
interests in whaling -- all at the expense of the taxpayer. But
finally things are changing, as &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23024633-5000117,00.html"&gt;
the truth is beginning to hit home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, one of Japan's leading newspapers, the &lt;a href="http://www.asahi.com/"&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;, called into
question the validity of the whaling programme, by asking "Why is
the Japanese government so insistent on engaging in whaling?". The
report cited concerns about the use of taxpayers' money, dubious
science, the lack of interest from the fishing industry in
supporting the whaling programme and the fact that former employees
of the Japanese government Fisheries Agency were "parachuted" into
key (and well paid) roles in the supposedly independent Institute
of Cetacean Research - the agency which commissions the whaling
fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years the Japan Fisheries Agency has claimed that
whaling is integral to Japanese culture. Yet when shown pictures of
modern whaling in the Southern Ocean, complete with factory ships
and grenade-tipped harpoons, Japanese people don't recognise
anything traditional about it.  In fact, modern whaling methods
were introduced by the US after World War II as a means of
addressing food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a survey conducted by the Nippon Research Centre, in
2006, showed that  over 95 percent of the public had never or very
rarely eaten whale meat. It also found that 90 percent of Japanese
people had no idea their government hunted whales in the Southern
Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and once they were aware of it, 69 percent
disagreed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2006/12/stockpiles_of_whalemeat_are_in.html"&gt;
Japan has over 4000 tonnes of frozen whale meat in storage&lt;/a&gt;, and
despite the government's attempts to make eating it part of
Japanese culture, the public just aren't interested. Instead, there
is a growing interest in the campaign to end whaling in the
Southern Ocean. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/"&gt;TheGreenpeace Japan website&lt;/a&gt;
has been attracting an extraordinaryincrease in traffic. Last week
the number of page views jumped from10,000 a day to 10,000 in one
hour. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/fake-science-exposed180108/Whaling-receives-criticism200108"&gt;
Visitors to the web site are also writing letters to Japanese
governmentministers asking them to stop squandering tax payers
money on whaling, via an online petition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real beneficiaries of Japanese whaling are a few bureaucrats
who maintain the industry on subsidies to cover shrinking whalemeat
sales, while damaging Japan's reputation and profitability abroad. 
It's time for the taxpayers, the media,  and the business community
of Japan to call for an end to this scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action: Stop the new whaling ship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/new-whaling-ship-121207#letter"&gt;If Japan succeeds in plans to build a new whaling factory ship, whaling could continue for decades.  Tell the Japanese Prime Minister that building the new factory ship is a bad idea. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help raise money to save whales&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org/visitor/index.php?event_id=main"&gt;Create your own Whale Defenders page; get your friends and family to help you defend the whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Yesterday, after 11 days of preventing the Japanese whaling fleet from killing whales, activists from the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, temporarily blocked the fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru from being illegally refueled in Antarctic waters.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace inflatable boat tries to prevent Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship Nisshin Maru from refueling from the supply vessel Oriental Bluebird in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a dramatic peaceful protest, two of our activists
drove an inflatable boat between the factory ship and the refueling
vessel, as the two massive ships began moving closer together in
preparation for refueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace inflatables were launched while members of the
Esperanza's crew warned the Japanese vessels, which were still
about a mile apart, that our boat and activists were beside the
refueling vessel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Bluebird"&gt;Oriental
Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, to oppose the illegal refueling within the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty"&gt;Antarctic
Treaty area&lt;/a&gt;. But the two ships continued to close in on each
other trapping one of our inflatables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Before inflatables were launched the
crew of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza radioed the Panamanian
flagged Oriental Bluebird, in Japanese, Spanish and English, with a
statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Oriental Bluebird must leave Antarctic waters immediately:
your presence here is unwanted and a threat to the pristine
Antarctic environment which has been declared a particularly
sensitive sea area by the International Maritime Organisation and a
'natural reserve, devoted to peace and science' by the &lt;a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/environmental_issues/environmental_protocol.php"&gt;
Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt;… Japan, as a
party to the Treaty, must comply with the letter and the spirit of
the Treaty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about half an hour our inflatable - 8 meters long between
vessels of around 130 and 160 meters length - prevented the two
ships from starting to refuel. Eventually the inflatable was forced
out, with our driver narrowly avoiding getting caught by a
cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ships began exchanging their goods: fuel for the Nisshin
Maru to continue hunting whales, and the boxed "scientific results"
(whale meat) for the Oriental Bluebird to take back to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists continued to document the refueling and whale meat
transfer from inflatables. As they were doing so, the Japanese
hunter vessels spent more than an hour performing dangerous
maneuvers, driving directly towards our inflatables in order to
push them away from the Nisshin Maru and Oriental Bluebird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/the_oceanic_viking_arrives_in.html"&gt;
At this point, the Australian coastguard ship, the Oceanic Viking
appeared on the horizon.&lt;/a&gt; Their arrival had an immediate impact
on the activities. The hunter vessels slowed down and increased
their distance to the factory ships and as the Oceanic Viking came
closer they also turned off their hoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oceanic Viking launched two inflatables to document the
whaling fleet, free from the freezing water canon or dangerous
maneuvers of hunter ships. As our activists returned to the
Esperanza they radioed the Australian crew to request that the
Australian Government investigate the illegal refueling within
Antarctic waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Oriental Bluebird is an integral part of the
whaling fleet. But it does not having any permit from the
Panamanian Government as required by the International Whaling
Commission. Japan is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, which is
designed to ensure protection of the Antarctic environment. But the
whaling fleet consistently fails to submit the required
environmental impact assessments to the Antarctic Treaty
Secretariat. The Oriental Bluebird also lacks this documentation.
Ironically, Panama takes a position in defense of whales, at the
International Whaling Commission and elsewhere and yet they
participate in whaling by allowing the Oriental Bluebird to operate
under their flag. Greenpeace is urging Panama to de-flag the
Oriental Bluebird, or order it stop supporting the needless
slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Japanese Fisheries Agency said at a press briefing
that they have not resumed whaling because the Esperanza is with
them. Greenpeace activists are in the Southern Ocean to peacefully
stop the hunt and that is what they have done. But it is not enough
to stop whaling only when the world's eyes are on the fleet and the
Esperanza is on its tail. Japan must call an end to this whaling
season now and make it the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government has come under increasing pressure over
their whaling programme and yesterday that pressure increased after
Greenpeace Japan Whales Project Leader Junichi Sato wrote an open
letter to Japanese business leaders warning of the negative impact
that whaling is having on the country's reputation
internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already the New Zealand division of Toyota has condemned whaling
and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even the former whaling company Nissui, has acknowledged that
whaling is bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green" style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The letter
states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'By hunting nearly 1,000 whales including endangered fin whales,
byusing tax payers' money, under the name of "research" in
aninternationally recognized whale sanctuary, the Japanese
government iscreating huge environmental, economic, and diplomatic
friction, thenegative impact of which many professionals in the
economic andfinancial world in Japan have underestimated.  As
Nippon Suisan Kaisha,Ltd. (Nissui), one of the major ex-whaling
companies, said, "Involvementin whaling is a business risk."
Whaling creates a negative image to theworld for Japanese companies
and the country itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action: Stop the new whaling ship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/new-whaling-ship-121207#letter"&gt;If Japan succeeds in plans to build a new whaling factory ship, whaling could continue for decades.

	President Bush has tried again to make the world believe that he will rectify his shameful record of ignoring, denying and fuelling climate change. He's announced that by 2025, the US will stop increasing its emissions. Yes, for another 15 years the country that has spewed more emissions into the atmosphere than any other country on Earth will continue to emit more and more.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush must have missed the reports by the Noble Prize winning
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The IPCC
unequivocally says that global emissions need to peak within the
next 10 years at the latest. Ten years, not 17!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush's plan for after 2025 is also lamentable. Bush says, the US
may cut emissions, if coal can be made clean, nuclear power is safe
- and pigs can be genetically engineered to fly. This is a woefully
inadequate response by an administration that has obstructed global
efforts to tackle climate change at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush arrived as an oil man from Texas at the White House in
2001. He leaves as an oil man from Texas in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush made his speech on the occasion of the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bush-s-major-emitters-meeting/"&gt;
Major Emitters Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (MEM)  currently underway in Paris. This
US-driven initiative, launched last year, brings together 16
countries that collectively emit over 80 percent of global
emissions to discuss climate change. But the MEM, like Bush's
speech, is nothing but an attempt by the Bush administration to
deflect attention from its shameful record on tackling climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding emission targets for industrialised countries are the
basis of any meaningful global agreement to fight climate change.
France said as much at the last climate summit in Bali last
December. Climate talks that don't result in binding targets for
industrialised countries are meaningless, France said. Which begs
the question - why is French President Sarkozy hosting this useless
talking shop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCain, Obama and Clinton all support binding emission
reductions for the whole US economy. That is good news, because
Bush is a 'lame duck' and will be out of office when the next
global climate agreement will be made in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries attending the MEM, must listen to Noble Peace Prize
Laureate, Desmond Tutu. In a statement supporting Greenpeace's
position on the MEM he reminds rich world leaders of their
responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many rich world leaders have not, so far, responded to the
climate crisis with the urgency required. Cushioned and cosseted,
they have had the luxury of closing their minds to the real impact
of what is happening in the fragile and precious atmosphere that
surrounds the planet we live on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wonder how much more anxious they might be, if they depended
on the cycle of mother nature to feed their families. How much
greater would their concerns be if they lived in slums and
townships, in mud houses, or shelters made of plastic bags? In
large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, this is a reality. The poor, the
vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh edge of climate
change every day of their lives. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the Major Economies Meeting in Paris, developed countries
must commit to immediate action against climate change. The United
Nations need to deliver an action plan to save the planet at the
climate change conference in 2009. There is no time to be
distracted from the urgent task to deliver this global rescue plan.
The world is watching, and those who are feeling the impacts of
climate change today, are expecting decisive action - now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;US burden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an attendee of the MEM, South Africa's environment minister
immediately condemned Bush's speech by saying: "There is no way
whatsoever that we can agree to what the US is proposing, which
means that the fundamental distinction between developed and
developing countries should be erased and that we should turn a
blind eye to historical responsibility for the problem. In effect,
the US wants developing countries that already face huge poverty
and development challenges to pay for what the US and other highly
industrialized countries have caused over the past 150 years. We
are willing to do our fair share to address the climate challenge,
but not to carry a part of the US's burden."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries participating in Bush's meeting are: Japan,
France, Germany, Italy, the UK, China, Canada, India, Brazil, South
Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesian, and South Africa. The
countries most at risk from impacts of climate change - such as
small island developing states like Tuvalu - are not even invited
to be at the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arieta Moceica of Greenpeace Australia Pacific said from Suva,
Fiji: "While small islands like my own are sinking, Bush and
Sarkozy are wasting everyone's time in Paris at talks that fail to
deliver the rapid emissions reductions we need. The Paris talks
behind closed doors are nothing but a slap in the face of those
already suffering from climate change today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It seems you can't turn anywhere at a motor show these days without numerous manufacturers green claims competing for attention. But take a peek under the green hood and the industry has a huge, dirty, lobbying engine still stuck in reverse.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists displayed banners depicting car manufacturers as the wooden puppet Pinocchio.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To highlight how many of these green claims are just PR we
unfurled a banner of Pinocchio in front of the European car show in
Brussels. "Just as Pinocchio couldn't be a real boy till he stopped
telling lies, the car makers will never be green until they stop
showing off a green image at car shows while filling the roads with
ever heavier and more powerful gas guzzlers," said Helen Perivier,
Greenpeace International campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperate to protect their market for heavier and more powerful
cars, manufacturers last month succeeded in weakening an European
Union (EU) proposal to set mandatory carbon dioxide emissions
standards for their fleets sold in Europe and push for further
concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the car industry appears to fear most is exactly what we
need to tackle cars contribution to global warming - tough, legally
binding regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1996, when first threatened by European fuel efficiency
regulations, manufacturers promised they could make their cars more
efficient themselves. The much abused "please no rules, we promise
to be good" approach that is perfect for companies looking to
continue business as usual but almost always useless for protecting
the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, after the eight years car manufacturers had to
comply with previous voluntary targets the majority had failed
miserably to meet them. Then the EU Commission proposed to get
tough again in 2006 with new strict legally binding rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather then admit that tough rules were needed for the good of
the planet the car industry ramped up it formidable, multi-million
dollar lobby machine. European car manufactures (supported by US
car firms, like General Motors and Ford) have lobbied successfully
to weaken the proposed regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Profits over Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car industry is desperate to protect one of its most
profitable sectors - big heavy cars, often aimed at the top end of
the market. So far they have succeeded in weakening the EU proposal
to set mandatory carbon dioxide emissions standards for their
fleets sold in Europe and push for further concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that technologies exist to make cars more
efficient, the car makers continue to put profit well ahead their
responsibility to confront climate change when it really
matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the EU rules are to have any teeth to effectively control
carbon dioxide emissions they must be strengthened to including a
120g CO2/km standard as a fleet average for 2012; and a longer-term
target of 80g CO2/km by 2020; base emission standards on a car's
size and not its weight; and set effective penalties to ensure car
manufacturers respect the new standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the final law doesn't have teeth, no amount of green
marketing will be able to hide that fact that it was car makers who
drove a massively heavy and expensive wrecking ball through the
EU's good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cars/merkel-cars-letter/"&gt;Please write to the Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, today asking her to support strong emissions standards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace accepts no funding from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on our millions of supporters worldwide to give whatever they can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Schwarzenegger says they're "whining", Gartner says they're "sleepwalking". IT industry chiefs can help usher in a new low-carbon era, if only they would lead by example and lobby governments for a strong climate agreement in Copenhagen. That's what our new IT Climate Leadership Challenge is for.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're getting IT companies to make greener electronics. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/"&gt; Philips' recent transformation&lt;/a&gt; to a green leader in the electronics sector shows what public pressure can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to get the industry's heavyweights onto their feet and into the ring, so they help us fight the causes of climate change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT companies need to address their own carbon footprint, which is currently as large as the aviation industry's and growing. That's not enough though. Their influence with governments could be used to counter the lobbying of dirty old industries, intent on wrecking the Copenhagen negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenging all the big names in IT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT companies like to do the right thing when they know that consumers and competitors are watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on our quarterly &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, we will be periodically evaluating responses from the companies and will be highlighting those company CEOs who are stepping up to the Climate Challenge and showing true climate leadership in 2009 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>India's light bulb phase out: setting a smart example</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/india-light-bulb-phaseout-250209/</url><text>
	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Does Canon support shooting whales?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/canon-shooting-whales-240108/</url><text>
	Having saved over 100 whales by pursuing the Japanese whaling fleet's factory ship for over 5,000 miles,keeping it and the rest of the fleet out of action for 14 days, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza has run low on fuel and must return to port. Yet, as our ship heads to Hobart, Australia, the campaign to save the whales is far from over. We're focused on shooting whales... with cameras. But we were surprised to learn that Canon, the world's number one digital camera producer, isn't willing to condemn using harpoons -- despite their high-profile advertising and sponsorship programmes dedicated to wildlife and endangered species.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/Shoot-whales-with-a-CANON.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/Shoot-whales-with-a-CANON.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If you want to shoot a whale - use a CANON.…But only if Canon tells the whalers to lose the harpoons
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wrote to Canon headquarters in Japan asking their CEO to
speak out against Japan's whaling programme. But Canon declined to
take a stand against the killing of thousands of whales in the
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  Is this really wildlife as Canon
sees it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, Canon cameras shoot whales on whale-watching
expeditions but in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, many whales
are shot instead with exploding harpoons. Thousands of whales,
including endangered fin whales, have been killed here under the
guise of "scientific research" ever since the global moratorium on
whaling came into force in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale meat from the hunt is sold to a tiny minority of Japanese
people who eat whale meat -- the rest is turned into dog food or
added to the stockpile of around 4,000 tonnes of unsold meat.  &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Whales can be studied without killing them&lt;/a&gt;: the cloak of
"science" merely allows a few Japanese bureaucrats to maintain an
unprofitable whale meat industry at the expense of Japanese
taxpayers. Yet this scandal continues because there is not enough
domestic pressure in Japan to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="display: block; background-color: rgb(102, 204, 0); font-family: verdana; font-size: large; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Take Action: Ask the CEO of Canon
Japan to defend whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Fujio Mitarai, the CEO of Canon Japan, is a businessman,
a taxpayer, and the leader of a company that endorses wildlife
conservation. He is also the head of the Nippon Keidanren (Japanese
Business Federation). This is the highest position to which a CEO
can aspire in the Japanese business world and it means having the
ear of the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His voice could help put an end to a decades-old scientific hoax
and subsidy scandal, and add weight to Canon's claims to
environmental concern by actually saving the whales that advertise
Canon cameras. So we asked him to speak out against whaling within
Japanese society by signing the following statement to clarify
Canon's position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Canon is committed to building a better world for future
generations, and does not support the hunting of endangered or
threatened species with anything other than a camera. Canon
believes the lethal whaling research programme in the Southern
Ocean should be ended, and replaced with a non-lethal research
programme."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Canon has so far refused our request, saying "We
fully recognise the importance of protecting endangered wildlife.
We have continuously put our advertisements featuring "endangered
species" in National Geographic since 1981."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, their letter concluded,"scientific opinion about
research whaling varies... we will not signthe statement you have
sent us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25228/shotby-harpoon.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the whales need a powerful domestic ally in Japan -- so now
we're asking our supporters (and especially Canon customers) to
urge him to reconsider, and express his disapproval of lethal
research whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan wants to do research, it can do so with cameras and
other non-lethal means - just as we have been doing through our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
Great Whale Trail project&lt;/a&gt;, which uses satellite tracking, photo
identification and skin biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve our independence, we do not accept corporate
donations. Greenpeace is not sponsored by Canon, never has been,
and never will be.  We do use Canon cameras - thereare nine of them
aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza at the moment, one of them in
thehands of Leandra, our on-board scientist doing non-lethal
research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All were professional or personal purchases. We are not calling
for a boycott on Canon products -- they are not directly involved
in whaling -- we are challenging Canon to match word to deed, and
to take action for the whales, in the same way we seek to inspire
individuals to take action for a better world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Canon?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canon has built a great deal of its brand's reputation for
environmental concern through their sponsorship of environmental
causes, including the conservation of endangered species.  Canon
runs a popular series of ads in National Geographic Magazine
entitled  "Wildlife as Canon sees it" and supports wildlife
advocacy groups around the world with donations, equipment, and
expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that when a corporation draws income and brand value
from association with environmental causes, they have a
responsibility to speak out on those issues.  We trust that most of
the good folks at Canon, as one of the world's premier "wildlife
brands," share our concern that wildlife in general, and whales in
particular, should not die unnecessarily  for "science." &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canon &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/environment/eco2007e/p67.html"&gt;says on
its website&lt;/a&gt;that it wants to "hand over a beautiful Earth for
future generations".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25228/shot-with-a-canon.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corporation which paints itself as a defender of wildlifeand
one concerned about endangered species and the natural world
oughtto do more than express those values in images,
advertisements, andsponsorships: they need to use their immense
power to speak out and actfor a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Every day,supporters ask: Why no boycott?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace does notendorse a general boycott of Japanese
products. We know that themajority of Japanese people do not
actually support whaling, and we areanti-whaling, not
anti-Japanese.  We believe such a boycottwould be difficult to
focus, harm the wrong people, and be ineffectivein stopping
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width: 223px; float: left; margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 4px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_orig/international/photosvideos/photos/CanonAd-NationalG.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_orig/international/photosvideos/photos/CanonAd-NationalG.jpg','popup','width=747,height=1175,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0');return false"&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;Canon advertisement in National
Geographic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet wealso know there are deep sentiments among our supporters
to participatein such a boycott - they write to us literally every
day during thewhaling season either announcing they have launched
their own boycottor wanting to know why Greenpeace doesn't do the
same.  Evenin the absence of an organised boycott, whaling harms
Japan's imagewith potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's anexample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we heard from awoman who wrote to Toyota in
her home country, New Zealand, to say shewas not going to replace
her Prius with a new one, because Toyota, as aJapanese car company,
had an implicit association with Japan's whalingprogramme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota New Zealand wrote back to her to say"Please be assured
that Toyota New Zealand and Toyota Motor CorporationJapan do not
condone whaling for commercial, scientific or researchpurposes." 
While Toyota Japan later distanced themselves fromthis position, it
demonstrates how much of a liability whaling can befor Japanese
corporations operating in the West.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we looked at what other Japanesecorporations ought to be
enlisted to  speak out domesticallyagainst whaling, Canon leapt out
as an obviouschoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;My family and I love canon cameras- they are all we've ever owned, and we will love them even more if you prove to the world that Canon is committed to building a better world for future generations, and does not support the hunting of endangered or threatened species with anything other than a camera. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The earth would be incredibly less beautiful without whales.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/01/canon_can_save_whales.html"&gt;
Read more letters that have already been sent to Canon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whaling: more troublethan it's worth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Japanese officials are already speaking out about whaling
being a diplomatic liability.The Japanese decision, since put on
hold, to add humpback whales to thelist of species targeted in the
whale hunt led to formal complaintsfrom several of Japan's
allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times quoted oneofficial, who asked to remain
anonymous, as saying "[Whaling] is doingno good for Japanese
diplomacy. Many people are saying Japan is notbalancing its
interests, with a vocal minority dictating a course thatrisks some
of our most cherishedrelationships."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As head of the JapaneseBusiness Federation, Mister Mitarai has a
responsibility not just forCanon's own welfare, but also for the
collective well-being of Japanesebusinesses at home and abroad --
where whaling is a liability forJapanese brands and
theirprofitability.&lt;/p&gt;

Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary youcan write to him by clicking on
the link below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/"&gt;Tell the CEO of Canon that he shouldn't support the needless killing of threatend whales for science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations.

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Be part of the change you want to see in the world. Help us win more campaigns like this one!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals to win campaigns like this one. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests.

	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Justice for whales, justice for Greenpeace</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/whales-justice180209/</url><text>
	An ancient Japanese legend says that anyone who folds 1000 paper cranes will have their heart's desire come true. On 16 February, 1000 paper whales were delivered to the Japanese embassy in Stockholm with a message "Free Junichi and Toru".From deliveries of origami whales in Sweden, to giant wooden handcuffs in Hong Kong and caged prisoners in Turkey, activists from around the world have been visiting Japanese embassies and consulates this week to call for justice as the Tokyo Two faced their first formal court hearing.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support has come in from all over the planet. Activists have
been busy in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Turkey, Hong Kong,
the US, Israel, Greece, Russia, New Zealand, the Netherland, Mexico
and India!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, attended a
closed "pre-trial" court session in the Japanese city of Aomori on
February 13th, where they face a politically-driven prosecution and
up to ten years in prison for alleged theft and trespass. The two
were arrested in June 2008, after they exposed &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt;
a major embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the Japanese
government-sponsored whale hunt. They exposed abuse of taxpayer
subsidies in the hope of prompting an independent investigation
into the corrupt whale industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overreaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Two gathered &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt;
firm evidence&lt;/a&gt; that boxes of whale meat were being secretly
shipped to the homes of whaling fleet crew and sold for personal
gain. Junichi took a box of whale meat that had been disguised as
personal luggage from a depot and handed it over it to the Tokyo
Prosecutors' Office in May 2008 while filing a report of
embezzlement. But the investigation was dropped on June 20th - the
same day that both activists were arrested and then held for 26
days before being charged. They were interrogated for up to 12
hours day while handcuffed and strapped to chairs. Toru went on a
hunger strike for a week and refused to speak for 13 days to
highlight his political imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25055/greenpeace-staff-junichi-sato.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Junichi (left), Toru (right), and
their lead counsel, Yuichi Kaido (centre) facereporters at a press
briefing following their first pre-trial hearing at Aomori District
Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Junichi and Toru were released they have not been allowed
to talk to eachother or other Greenpeace activists. They are
forbidden to be away from their homes for extended periods and they
cannot leave the country. They can only speak with
journalistsseparately, in their lawyers' office. Both havebeen
followed by undercover police and receivedanonymous threats after
their addresses were revealed by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strong defence &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Two had no intent of illegal acquisition for personal
gain, which is one of the elements that defines the crime of
"theft" under Japanese law. And their defence counsel is also using
international law to argue that Junichi and Toru were exercising
their right to freedom of expression - guaranteed in the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). If
public watchdogs - such as media and non-governmental organisations
- are to function effectively, freedom of expression is essential.
Any conviction of a criminal offence in this instance would breach
Japan's obligations under the ICCPR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru face a further pre-trial hearing on 23 March,
while the start date of the public trial is yet to be decided. But
they are not facing this alone. Over 250,000 people are standing
beside them in solidarity as &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/arrest-us-091208/"&gt;
'co-defendants'&lt;/a&gt; who have asked Japan to arrest them too if
defending whales is a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/arrest-me-japan/"&gt;
Tell the Japanese government that if they are going to start
arresting people for defending whales, they are going to need a lot
of handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Breaking the ice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to raise awareness in Japan about this injustice and to
promote our other campaigns &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/aomori-commuinications-centre260109/"&gt;
we recently opened a communications centre&lt;/a&gt; in the
northernfishing district of Aomori were the Tokyo Two trial is
being held. And during the Sapporo Snow Festival in Hokkaido we
added some inspiration with an ice sculpture celebrating the beauty
and importance of our oceans. Carved by artist Yasuhiro Sone, the
sculpture included a humpback whale, a dolphin and a tuna - among
other sea creatures - swimming around a globe. The Festival is a
major event in Japan with up to two million visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Putting soya impacts on the map </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazon-mapping-200109/</url><text>
	Monitoring the effects of deforestation on the Amazon is a difficult undertaking. The Amazon is huge and it's extremely difficult to keep tabs on what's happening in the remote fringes of the rainforest. News of illegal logging and the spread of soya plantations can take a long time – if ever - to reach the authorities. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our team in Brazil is working with local communities to map the impacts of the soya industry in the Santarém region of the forest, the heart of soya production in the Amazon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team in Brazil has been working with the local community to map the impacts of the soya industry in the Santarém region of the forest, the heart of soya production in the Amazon. This is a collaborative project with the Brazilian organisations &lt;a title="Projeto Saude e Alegria" href="http://www.saudeealegria.org.br/"&gt;Projeto Saude e Alegria&lt;/a&gt; (Health and Happiness Project) and the Rural Workers Unions of Santarém and Belterra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="community map" href="/international/en/publications/reports/community-mapping-in-the-amazo/" target="_blank"&gt;community mapping&lt;/a&gt; project focuses on training people to use GPS technology to pinpoint the damage caused by intensive agriculture practices and empowering the local community to defend its land and the rainforest. Even though there's a moratorium at present on forest being cleared for new soya plantations, current farming in these areas is still damaging the environment and the communities who live in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research collected for the map between May 2007 and June 2008 shows damage has spread along the highways carved through the forest. Soya farming has affected rivers as well: herbicides used on the crops have leeched into the water. Some rivers have even been dammed by farmers, affecting water supplies for those downstream. Others have silted up when wetland forest cover has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="350" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=104239242891667214226.000460d390932233b306b&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;s=AARTsJqA3rd-WNCFDt1KmtvpqFOyww8pxA&amp;amp;ll=-2.819601,-54.596558&amp;amp;spn=0.960129,1.167297&amp;amp;z=9&amp;amp;output=embed" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;&lt;a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=104239242891667214226.000460d390932233b306b&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;ll=-2.819601,-54.596558&amp;amp;spn=0.960129,1.167297&amp;amp;z=9&amp;amp;source=embed"&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local groups take control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their environment deteriorates, the future of local communitiesis at stake. Traditional routes through the forest are blocked by expansive soya plantations and people have been forced to sell their land as a result of pollution from agrochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information collected for the maps even documents cases where entire communities have disappeared due to the destruction that has made their former way of life impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communities that continue to exist in spite of the destruction are also on the community map. Many rural communities that have managed to somehow adapt to the destruction are included in this project - for some, this is the first time they have ever been formerly identified on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation of the land in this region is an important step in the fight to save the Amazon. By helping local communities document what's happening to the forest and rivers around them, control is finally back in their hands. Ever since US company Cargill announced its plans to build a controversial soya processing and port facility in Santarém, these communities have fought to show the detrimental effecta growing soya industry has on the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cargill facility was built without the environmental impact assessment required by the government. Cargill finally submitted the assessment to the authorities at the end of last year and we are currently awaiting the announcement of the public hearing where further discussions will take place on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, this mapping project could also provide a model for how the money from global funding mechanisms needed to stop dangerous climate change could be spent to ensure that local people are the guardians of their forests. This will be essential if we are to save the climate and protect forests in the Amazon and around the world in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace activists cleared in landmark global warming trial</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kingsnorth-trial-verdict100908/</url><text>
	In an unprecedented trial a UK Crown Court jury has acquitted six Greenpeace UK volunteers of criminal damage to a coal-fired power plant. The jury, consisting of representatives from the British public, found their actions justified when considering the damage to property caused around the world by CO2 emissions from the plant.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace cleared! Coal found GUILTY!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six volunteers - Kevin, Emily, Tim, Will, Ben and Huw -
attempted to shut down the Kingsnorth power station in Kent last
year by scaling the chimney and painting the Prime Minister's name
down the side. The defendants had intended to paint 'GORDON BIN IT'
down the side of the chimney but were served a High Court
injunction by police helicopter, meaning they only got as far as
painting the Prime Minister's first name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25126/kingsnorth5outof5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/tags/kingsnorth"&gt;Read the
trial updates from Greenpeace UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawful excuse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were accused of causing £30,000 (US$53,000) of criminal
damage to the Kingsnorth smokestack from painting. The defence was
that they had a 'lawful excuse' - because they were acting to
protect property around the world "in immediate need of protection"
from the impacts of climate change, caused in part by burning
coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence used evidence to prove that burning coal inflicts
enormous damage upon ecosystems, people and property across the
planet - and that the UK government was failing to take effective
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first case where preventing property damage from
climate change has been used as part of a 'lawful excuse' defence
in Crown Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NASA scientist called for a moratorium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the world's leading climate scientist, James
Hansen, came to court and challenged the government's plans for new
coal, calling for Gordon Brown to announce a moratorium on all new
coal-fired power plants without carbon capture and storage. The
environmental policy adviser for the UK shadow Prime Minister said
there was "a staggering mismatch between what we've heard from
government and what we've seen from government in terms of
policy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert on climate change impacts in the UK said some of the
property in immediate need of protection from sea level rises
included parts of Kent (Kingsnorth being "extremely vulnerable")
and that "it behoves us to act with urgency". And an Inuit leader
told of his first hand experiences of the impacts of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing all of the evidence, the jurors supported the
right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning
of coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in the light of the verdict, the plans to build a new coal
plant at Kingsnorth (which could emit as much as the world's 30
least polluting countries combined every year for 40 or 50 years)
show that Gordon Brown's government is failing to act on climate
change. Instead they are pumping out policies that are actively
leading us in the wrong (and very dangerous) direction. UK
Ministers now find themselves in a very tight corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;This verdict marks a tipping point for
the climate change movement. It stands as an example to governments
everywhere and an inspiration to people world-wide that they can
and should take a stand against coal fired power stations in
defence of the climate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;Join the Quit COALition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Our work relies on donations from people like you.

	It's a victory for the Whitsunday Islands and the Great Barrier Reef, with a 20-year moratorium on all new shale oil projects in the region. Led by the Save Our Foreshore group, the success shows just how powerful local, grassroots campaigns can be.
&lt;div&gt;

            Aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef off the Whitsunday Islands. The proposed shale oil mine would have posed a range of threats to the region.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban has been welcomed by just about everyone but the
QueenlandResource Council, whose proposal was set to mine millions
of tonnes ofshale rock each year on a site just 10 km from the
gateway to the GreatBarrier Reef. The shale oil mine threatened to
drain precious watersupplies, and to risk toxic leaching and air
pollution from waste rock.Shale oil production is extremely
greenhouse gas intensive - emissionsfrom this project, combined
with the company's other plannedoperations, would have raised
Australia's current total emissions by30 percent within 20
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great win but it is madness that such a project could
haveeven been considered. We are facing catastrophic climate change
- wemust urgently cut emissions, not increase them. We don't need
toendanger the Great Barrier Reef or anywhere else by mining
fossilfuels. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/climate-change/solutions/clean-energy"&gt;
There are better energy sources&lt;/a&gt; that are ready to go right now.
If Queensland Premier Anna Bligh canblock this proposal for climate
reasons, we look forward to herblocking other major fossil fuel
projects in the state, includingexport coal expansions, for the
same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined &lt;a href="http://www.saveourforeshore.com/"&gt;Save Our Foreshore&lt;/a&gt; in

            Brazil needs to commit itself to targets for reducing greenhouse gasses, eliminating the deforestation of the Amazon
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; sailed through heavy rains into the port of Manaus to an energetic welcome from local partners, state government representatives and media who are lending their support to our campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Save the Planet: now…or NOW" tour will focus on solutions to deforestation and climate change, together with an end to nuclear energy in Brazil. It will also highlight the positive impacts that healthy forests, oceans and renewable energy in Brazil can have on the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this year's crucial UN meeting on climate change in Copenhagen on the horizon - come December the international community will have to start its blueprint for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, it is now or never, as the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; helps spread the urgency of the problem and the need for governments to act on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is clear: in 2015, global CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions must be stabilised and deforestation completely halted in the Amazon. By 2050, we need to have built a zero carbon future. To meet this challenge, we need a global effort to share responsibilities among citizens, governments, private businesses and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the images of the Save the Planet tour's first stop - Manaus and the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise's&lt;/em&gt; first port of call - in what is arguably the most important year for climate discussions - is no coincidence. Brazil plays a pivotal role in the global climate debate as it is currently the 4th largest greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitter in the planet. Furthermore, Brazil is in an important position to combat climate change, being among the 10 largest economies in the world and is the fourth largest emitter of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation and misuse of land, mainly in the Amazon, is responsible for 75 percent of Brazilian emissions of GHGs. The destruction of the Amazon forest releases more than 800 million tonnes ofcarbon dioxide every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil needs to commit itself to targets for reducing greenhouse gases, eliminating the deforestation of the Amazon by 2015, promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency and implementing a network of marine areas to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; will be open to the public at its ports of call.

	As expert witnesses go, they don’t come any better than Professor James Hansen, one of the world’s leading climate scientists and Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. On Wednesday, he was called to give evidence before a UK Court on the threat posed by Kingsnorth coal-fired power station to the world’s climate. Six Greenpeace activists are being charged with criminal damage after they took action last October, to highlight the threat posed by Kingsnorth.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the worst climate offender
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen's evidence will be crucial in establishing their defence,
since while the defendants accept the damage they caused, they say
they did so to prevent much greater damage to other property and
the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawful damage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial is in its fifth day. The &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-meet-defendants-20080829"&gt;
six Greenpeace activists&lt;/a&gt; are on trial for scaling a smokestack
at Kingsnorth power station in October last year. They have been
charged with causing £30,000 worth of criminal damage for painting
"GORDON" down the chimney. They planned to paint "GORDON - BIN IT",
but they weren't able to because of poor light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defendants accept that they caused the damage, but are
arguing that is was lawful for them to damage the chimney in order
to protect other property in Kent (where Kingsnorth is located),
and around the world, said to be at the risk of much more serious
damage from climate change caused to a large degree by coal-fired
power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Hansen was called to the stand to give evidence.
Hansen has an impressive CV, having spent the last 20 years
studying the Earth's climate. As well as numerous accolades for his
work, he has given evidence to the US Congress and Senate several
times and warned a succession of US Vice-Presidents, including Al
Gore, about the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

Court&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kingsnorth kills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told the 12 jurors at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent that
emissions from the Kingsnorth power station led to damage to
property worldwide, as well as the extinction of species and the
creation of climate change refugees. During his testimony, Hansen
warned that, if the world continues with business-as-usual, our
descendants will be "left with a much more desolate planet and much
less biodiversity". He said that even a two degree rise in
temperature is "a recipe for global disaster" and that the last
time the Earth was more than two degrees warmer than it is now,
there was a 25-metre sea level rise. He pointed out that the UK
bears the most responsibility for historical CO2 emissions in the
atmosphere per person (followed by the US and then Germany) and
that, if the UK carries on with business as usual, it could cause
the extinction of nearly one million species; several hundred of
these species extinctions could be associated directly with
Kingsnorth power station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25128/kingsnorth.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Live Earth, last year, he was invited to go on stage with
Al Gore. He took his grandchildren along. "How many species do we
need to save?", he asked them. "All of them," said his
grand-daughter. "Me too," said his grandson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can't save all of them," Hansen told the Court, "but we can
still save most." But, although "there's just barely still time" we
need an immediate moratorium on the construction of all new
coal-fired power plants (without &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ccs-not-going-to-save-the-clim/"&gt;
CCS&lt;/a&gt;) and the phasing out of existing coal plants. And somebody
- whether it's the UK, US or Germany - needs "to stand up".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Gordon Brown," he said, "should announce a moratorium on all
new coal plants without carbon capture and storage." Speaking to
the Jury, he also agreed with a statement made by former US Vice
President and Nobel Peace Laureate, Al Gore: "I can't understand
why there aren't rings of young people blocking bulldozers and
preventing them from constructing coal-fired power stations". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Hansen's evidence, another defence expert witness,
Dr Geoffrey Meaden (via video link from Brazil), confirmed that the
examples of climate change impacts being cited by the defendants
are 'true circumstances'. "It is overwhelmingly perceived," he
said, "by the defendants, the scientific community and myself" that
we are changing our climate. "There's an increasing urgency," he
said, "for all citizens and governments to take action." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25128/nonewcoal.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Within five years," said Dr Meaden, "there could be no summer
ice left in the Arctic...Ironically, the Kingsnorth area itself
will be extremely vulnerable to flooding due to climate change. The
situation is so urgent that unless we act immediately to rapidly
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by the next century we may have to
abandon up to 20 percent of Kent to the sea... It behoves us to act
with urgency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taking a stand &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our activists, Emily, also took the stand, and introduced
herself and how she'd come to be involved with Greenpeace. Emily
explained that whatever emissions are in the atmosphere now will
have impacts for years to come. When asked why she climbed the
chimney, she said, "I felt very strongly that I wanted to do that."
And, when the pictures of her hanging off the top of Kingsnorth's
smokestack were handed out, at least a couple of jurors gasped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another activist, Kevin, was next and introduced himself as a
rope access worker from Wiltshire who had become concerned about
climate change back in the '80s. Kevin's questions focused mostly
on the safety aspects of the direct action. Much of the evidence
presented by the expert witnesses was of a highly complicated
technical nature and the 12 jurors really have a tough job to take
it all in. But, in the end, burning fossil fuels causes climate
change that is wreaking massive damage to the environment, the
economy and human health. It is not too late to bring climate
change under control and avoid the worst impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody needs to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/subscribe-kingsnorth-trial-updates"&gt;Stay updated on this trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford the necessary legal support for our activists.

<item><language>en</language><title>Boulders against bottom trawling  </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/boulders-against-bottom-trawli/</url><text>
	The fishing industry seems determined to catch every last fish in the North Sea.  The governments of the region and the EU have done little to stop them, but  they may soon hit a few snags: a team from Greenpeace Germany and Greenpeace Netherlands has sailed into the German North Sea and begun placing 150 granite rocks on the seabed.  They are hoping that the rocks, each weighing 2-3 tonnes and measuring one square cubic metre, will prevent fishing boats from bottom trawling on the Sylt Outer Reef.  This highly destructive fishing method involves a net being dragged across the seabed indiscriminately catching everything in its path.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/a-team-from-the-greenpeace-shi.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bottom-trawling boats drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying fragile underwater ecosystems and decimating fish stocks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling not only decimates stocks of popular fish, such
as sole and plaice, but it also results in a large amount of
bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or
dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Netherlands and Greenpeace Germany are taking direct
action to protect the fragile rocky reef and sandbank habitats and
the many species that are dependent on them. The German Government
and fishing industry are unwilling to address the ongoing
destruction of vulnerable marine habitats and the imminent collapse
of North Sea fish stocks.  We hope that fishermen will now steer
clear of the Sylt Outer Reef and respect it as a marine
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25132/150-granite-rocks-are-being-pl.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, fish stocks are in free fall with around 90 percent of
predatory species, like tuna, having been wiped out since the
1950s. If we carry on with business as usual, very soon there will
be no fish left and no future for the industry. Only in June,
scientists warned that cod stocks in the North Sea are so depleted
that fishing must be halted altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, these warnings have been ignored. Rather than
establishing a marine reserve to allow the North Sea to recover,
European Ministers continue to bury their heads in the sand and
vote to increase catch quotas year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in areas recognised for their high ecological importance,
such as the Sylt Outer Reef, the destruction continues. Not only is
fishing allowed, but also industry extracts vast quantities of sand
and gravel, with devastating consequences for marine habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper these types of activity shouldn't be happening. The
Sylt Outer Reef is protected under European law - designated as a
'Special Area of Conservation' under the EU Habitats Directive. But
in reality this protection is worth little more than the paper it
is written on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are demanding that the German government push the European
Commission to put in place new measures to enforce a ban on fishing
in the area by the beginning of next year at the latest. We also
want the Dutch, Danish and UK governments to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want the German government to immediately put a stop to
the industrial extraction of sand and gravel in the area by
ensuring no new licences are issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, governments need to establish a global network of
fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of the world's
oceans, including the North Sea.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;In order to preserve our independence we don't accept money from governments or corporations.

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior raises a reaction for the climate in Israel</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/rainbow-warrior-raises-a-react/</url><text>
	The Israeli police, supported by the navy, arrested the captain of the Rainbow Warrior - together with 14 Greenpeace activists, the photographer and the videographer - for passing on the message to “Quit Coal”. Activists had been painting the message, in English and Hebrew, on a ship importing coal to the Ashkelon power plant in Israel. Police boarded the Rainbow Warrior before we had even started the painting.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/9/israeli-marine-forces-board-th.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/9/israeli-marine-forces-board-th.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Israeli Marine forces boarded the Rainbow Warrior at the military restricted area near the Ashkelon coal plant before arresting 14 activists together with the captain who were simply asking Israel to "Quit Coal" and "Save the Climate".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Captain, Daniel Rizotti, was arrested by Israeli police. The
officers, arriving on a military ship and carrying machine guns,
came on board and demanded that he sail back to Ashdod, the port we
had left that morning. So, still waiting for the release of our
activists, we sailed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest marked the launch of our "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
Quit Coal: Save the Climate&lt;/a&gt;" tour through the Mediterranean and
Europe. Israel is only the beginning of our journey; we're visiting
11 countries en route to Poland, where crucial UN climate
negotiations continue this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why "Quit Coal"?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, when it comes to climate change, coal is by far the
worst offender.  Yet governments seem to be missing the message,
approving plans for hundreds of new coal-fired plants. If they
don't wake up to the urgent need to stop this, then by 2030 carbon
emissions coming from coal will have increased by some 60 percent.
We're here to sound the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our action in Israel was a wake-up call to the government to
abandon its plans for a new coal plant in Ashkelon. Despite
thousands of Israelis voicing their opposition to this unnecessary
and dirty plant, the government has approved plans anyway. But it's
not too late! &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-israel/news/coal_action_092008"&gt;Greenpeace
is urging all Israelis - whether at home or abroad - to lodge a
complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunny Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is very, very sunny. So it's pretty crazy that Israel is
not embracing this solar potential and instead continues to rely on
imported coal (not to mention the CO2 emissions of shipping the
coal to Israel from Colombia, Indonesia and Australia). Israel is
getting some things right - it has built the world's first solar
thermal plant, and it's selling that technology worldwide.
Something to celebrate indeed. But more is needed for Israel to be
guaranteed a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world must quit its addiction to coal; luckily we have the
cure. Greenpeace's &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/energyrevolution-250107/"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 50%, and deliver half the world's energy needs by
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, we now have our captain, activists, media team,
inflatables and cameras  back on board. We've been deported from
Israel, but now we're heading for Turkey - and the next stage of
our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
"Quit Coal" tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

<item><language>en</language><title>US Congress Announces Ban on Toxic Chemicals</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/congress-announces-ban-on-toxi/</url><text>
	The US Congress has sent President Bush legislation that will make toys safer for little tots and infants. The bill bans the use of six toxic chemicals, called phthalates, that are added to vinyl plastic to make it flexible.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Toxic chemicals banned in toys.
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thousands of our supporters wrote members of Congress to help
overcome heavy lobbying by ExxonMobil who manufactures
phthalates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation will cover products made for children up to 12
years of age, ranging from baby teethers to Barbie dolls.
Unfortunately, the new law will not cover vinyl products that
aren't playthings, although every parent knows that everything in
the home has the potential to be sucked on or put in a child's
mouth. Vinyl products not covered by the legislation include car
safety seats, clothing, children's furniture and other vinyl
household products ranging from shower curtains to floor and wall
coverings. The law also does not cover other chemicals such as
bisphenol-a (BPA), which has been found in polycarbonate plastic
baby bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Greenpeace's Toxics Campaign&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1996 Greenpeace has led global campaigns to eliminate the
use of these chemicals in toys and other consumer products. We were
the first organization to expose that vinyl toys contained toxic
chemicals after testing a wide range of children's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;Normal0&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one industry scientist admitted, phthalatesare easily
released from vinyl products like water from a "moist sponge"
whenchildren chew or suck on them. Eliminating exposures to toxic
chemicals iscritical, especially among young children. Phthalates
present a number ofhealth conerns; some are classified in Europe as
'toxic to reproduction' whileothers are toxic to the liver and
kidney, albeit at higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If President Bush signs this new US law, it will permanently
eliminate the use of three phthalates used in vinyl children's
products. It will also ban three additional phthalates until more
thorough safety tests are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Eliminating Toxic Dangers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one industry scientist admitted, phthalates are easily
released from vinyl products like water from a "moist sponge" when
children chew or suck on them. Eliminating exposures to toxic
chemicals is critical, especially among young children. Phthalates
can have a wide variety of health effects ranging from deformation
of reproductive organs to damage to kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinyl plastics or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can contain more
toxic additives than any other plastic. Phthalates are added to
make vinyl soft and flexible and can account for 20 to 30 percent
of the product (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/reports4/this-vinyl-house"&gt;
read our 2001 report This Vinyl House&lt;/a&gt;). Other additives that
have been found in vinyl include heavy metals such as lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Congress and the President Must
Lead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to address these toxic hazards, Congress must take a
bigger step by overhauling US chemical policy. Several states are
beginning to do this and in 2007 the EU adopted a new chemicals
policy (REACH) that prohibits the marketing of chemicals in
products that have not been fully tested for their health
effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;Normal0&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;p&gt; andstipulates substitution of hazardous chemicals by safer
alternatives. In 2009, Congress should finish the job and enact
comprehensive reform of U.S. chemical policy to eliminate these
toxic hazards in products and require the use of safer substitutes
that will protect our families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this new law is a critical first step that ExxonMobil
spent millions to stop, and will likely lean on President Bush to
veto. &lt;b&gt;If you'd like to help you can call the White House today
at +1 (202) 456-1414 and urge President Bush to sign the Consumer
Product Safety Commission Authorization bill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Boys burning electronic cables and other electrical components in order to melt off the plastic and reclaim the copper wiring. This burning in small fires releases toxic chemicals into the environment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing demand for the latest fashionable mobile phone,
flat screen TV or super-fast computer creates ever larger amounts
of obsolete electronics that are often laden with toxic chemicals
like lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants. Rather than
being safely recycled, much of this e-waste gets dumped in
developing countries. Previously, we have exposed pollution from
e-waste scrap yards in &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25134/recycling-of-electronic-waste.pdf"&gt;
China and India&lt;/a&gt;. Nigeria has also been identified as a &lt;a href="http://www.ban.org/BANreports/10-24-05/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;dumping ground for old electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our investigation into the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/e-waste-toxic-not-in-our-backyard210208/"&gt;
shady e-waste trade&lt;/a&gt;, we uncovered evidence that e-waste is
being exported, often illegally, to Ghana from Europe and the US.
We visited Ghana to investigate workplace contamination from
e-waste recycling and disposal in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the yards, unprotected workers, many of them children,
dismantle computers and TVs with little more then stones in search
of metals that can be sold. The remaining plastic, cables and
casing is either burnt or simply dumped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pr1zQrXM_7s&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the samples contained toxic metals including lead in
quantities as much as one hundred times above background levels.
Other chemicals such as phthalates, some of which are known to
interfere with sexual reproduction, were found in most of the
samples tested.  One sample also contained a high level of
chlorinated dioxins, known to promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Bridgen, from our science unit, has visited scrap
yards in China, India and Ghana: "Many of the chemicals released
are highly toxic, some may affect children's developing
reproductive systems, while others can affect brain development and
the nervous system.  In Ghana, China and India, workers, many of
them children, may be substantially exposed to these hazardous
chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;How does it get to Ghana?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers filled with old and often broken computers, monitors
and TVs - from brands including Philips, Canon, Dell, Microsoft,
Nokia, Siemens and Sony - arrive in Ghana from Germany, Korea,
Switzerland and the Netherlands under the false label of
"second-hand goods". Exporting e-waste from Europe is illegal but
exporting old electronics for 'reuse' allows unscrupulous traders
to profit from dumping old electronics in Ghana. The majority of
the containers' contents end up in Ghana's scrap yards to be
crushed and burned by unprotected workers. &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-trash/carroll-text/7" target="_blank"&gt;Some traders report&lt;/a&gt; that to get a shipping
container with a few working computers they must accept broken junk
like old screens in the same container from exporters in developed
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What's the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working computers and mobile phones can have a new lease
of life in some African countries, they create pollution when
thrown away due to the high levels of toxic chemicals they contain.
This is why we are &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
pressuring the biggest electronic companies&lt;/a&gt; to phase out toxic
chemicals and introduce global recycling schemes. Both of these
steps are vital to tackle the growing tide of toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies are making progress towards taking responsibility
for the entire lifecycle of their products. However, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sharp-8"&gt;
Sharp&lt;/a&gt; stand out for refusing to accept that they are
responsible for recycling their old products. The stance of these
powerful multinationals is ensuring there will always be a digital
divide that they prefer remains hidden, a dangerous divide with
unprotected workers in developing countries left with the toxic
legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Behind the story&lt;/p&gt;

	Over the last month there have been a catalogue of accidents at the French nuclear site Tricastin-Pierrelatte. We’ve followed all the breaking stories on our new weblog ‘Nuclear Reaction’. Now Greenpeace France has launched two court cases in an effort to find out what’s really been going on at the site.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists make an unexpected appearance during the opening ceremony of the World Energy Conference.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a heck of a nuclear month in France, here's a timeline
of what we know so far:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 7, 11PM, over 74 kilos of
uranium is leaked into the environment  from &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/only_18000_litres.html"&gt;
Tricastin&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 8, 7AM, eight hours later the
authorities are informed;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 8, 1PM,  Restrictions on
fishing, bathing and drinking local water are introduced 14 hours
after the accident;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 17, investigation of the leak
reveals that there is &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/areva_uranium_leak_update.html"&gt;
more radioactivity&lt;/a&gt; present than the leak could have caused.
Further investigation suggests that the military, who stored
radioactive material at the site underground without proper
containment in the 60's and 70's could be to blame;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 23, a leaking pipe results in
&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/slightly_contaminated.html"&gt;
100 workers&lt;/a&gt; being exposed to radioactive particles from a
leaking pipe;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px"&gt;July 29, a false alarm results in
120 workers being evacuated, tests show that &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/07/tricastin_again.html"&gt;
45 employees&lt;/a&gt; have traces of radiation on them from the previous
weeks' leak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first incident the French police have launched an
investigation and the French Environment Minister has ordered tests
of the ground water at all French nuclear power facilities. That's
of little comfort to a community which has discovered that their
water could have been contaminated by radioactive waste for the
last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're suing French power company Areva and its subsidiary
company Socatri for causing water pollution, and for the
abandonment and illegal deposit of waste. Our aim is to bring into
the public eye the circumstances that led to these problems and
expose the terrible safety record of the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva is the 90 percent state owned flagship of the French
nuclear industry, and along with the French power company EDF is a
key part in President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to spread nuclear
power to the word. Since coming to power Sarkozy has concluded
deals to spread French nuclear technology everywhere from Finland
to South Africa, and from the USA to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Sarkozy is intent on selling this technology to others
while unable to manage it securely at home says it all. Our message
for the President? "Nuclear Power? Non merci."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blog&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction"&gt;Blog - Nuclear Reaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both. We rely on over 2 million people worldwide who give whatever they can. Please join us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Brazilian environmental agency seems to have finally woken up to the problem of illegally logged Amazonian timber leaving their shores.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/bsle-express-in-santarem-port.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/4/bsle-express-in-santarem-port.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            BSLE Express in Santarém port in April 2008 after being arrested for carrying Amazon illegal timber to Europe. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian environmental agency seems to have finally woken
up to the problem of illegally logged Amazonian timber leaving
their shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, inspectors from IBAMA (the agency with responsibility
for regulating the timber industry), carried out an impromptu check
of timber cargo ships at the Brazilian Port of Santarem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, Brazilian customs had already given the green light
and the ship was preparing to leave. That is until IBAMA officials
discovered that documents for the cargo on the BSLE Express
contained false information about the species of timber onboard.
This is just one of the ways timber companies try to 'legalise'
timber that has been illegally logged or processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies connected with the shipment were slapped with
fines totaling over 100,000 Euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the first time in two years that the Brazilian authorities
have taken this sort of action, and it follows Greenpeace's recent
blockade at the French port of Caen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember that a few weeks ago we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/amazon-galina170308/"&gt;
stopped the cargo ship, the Galina III&lt;/a&gt;, from entering that
port. The ship was carrying timber that had come from companies
involved in illegal operations in the Amazon, and which was to be
sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Europe imports a huge amount of timber from the
Amazon no one is required to check whether it comes from companies
involved in illegal activities. We wanted to highlight this. The EU
is always saying that it is leading the world in the fight against
climate change, yet here they are inadvertently fuelling
deforestation in the Amazon by allowing illegally logged timber to
be sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This irony wasn't lost on the French government. It issued a
statement calling on the European Commission to tighten up the law
so that all timber sold in the Europe comes from legal sources and
well managed forests. The French Environment Minister, Jean-Louis
Borloo also got in touch with his Brazilian counterpart to work out
what else could be done to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the French government so worried? Because it knows that
unless deforestation in regions like the Amazon is stopped we will
have little hope of preventing the worst effects of climate change.
Tropical deforestation is responsible for about one-fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions - more than the world's entire transport
sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to companies slashing and burning the rainforest in
order to make a quick profit, the rate of deforestation and
resulting greenhouse gas emissions, are actually increasing. Brazil
is now the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind the
US, China and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogue companies operating illegally are driving much of this
devastation. Greenpeace's report - '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/future-for-forests/"&gt;
A Future for Forests&lt;/a&gt;' estimates that up to 80 percent of the
timber from the Amazon rainforest is illegally logged. And, it
isn't just the environmental impact of these companies' activities
that is worrying. Illegal logging encourages land grabbing by
farmers and speculators, and fuels corruption and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why we need to see more of the same from IBAMA alongside
action by the EU to tighten up checks on timber imports. The
prospect of more stringent EU regulation is looking promising. In
response to Greenpeace's blockade in Caen, the President Sarkozy
said he would look at what could be done when France takes over the
EU Presidency this Summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>amazon</value></taxonomy><date>2008-04-11 00:00:00</date></item>
<item><language>en</language><title>Quit Coal campaign completes Thailand tour</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/thailand-coal-rainbow-warrior280708/</url><text>
	After successful campaigns in New Zealand and the Philippines, the Rainbow Warrior spent 21 days in Thailand as part of the "Quit Coal, Lead the Energy [R]evolution Tour" promoting solutions to climate change. The tour included human banners, port blockades and a visit to the Ministry of Energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/8/greenpeace-hari-ini-menantang-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/8/greenpeace-hari-ini-menantang-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists brought hundreds of balloons, symbolising carbon emissions from new coal power plants in Thailand, to the Ministry of Energy in Bangkok.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand's energy revolution should be underway already thanks
to a new law that allows residents and villages to generate
electricity from wind turbines or other renewable sources and sell
surplus electricity back to grid. This should help alleviate
poverty and unemployment among Thais as well as generate clean
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds sweet - but the reality looks very different as many
bureaucratic barriers prevent people from taking up this
opportunity. And the lack of a Renewable Energy law that
prioritises green electricity over dirty electricity means that
investors are gearing up to build coal fired power plants instead
of windfarms. Last year even nuclear energy appeared on the
agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tour started on July 4th when the Rainbow Warrior, sailed
into Songkhla. We were launching a Greenpeace petition to the
Ministry of Energy demanding they reject coal, nuclear and other
fossil-fuel energy systems, a petition that was endorsed by over
1500 residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship then moved on to Thapsake on July 9th when hundreds of
local people joined the crew to form a human banner proclaiming
'Quit Coal' on the beach. The Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT) is proposing to build a 4000 MW coal-fired power
plant in Thapsakae but local communities are opposing it due to
concerns about pollution and climate change. These villagers added
their voice to the Greenpeace petition to the Ministry of
Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/prachuab-human-banner5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rayong province, on July 15th the crew of the Rainbow Warrior
staged a peaceful protest against the expansion of a Belgian-owned
coal power plant in Mapthaphut, anchoring a few meters off the coal
wharf and unfurling banners saying "Quit Coal" and "Coal = Climate
Change". The ship was confronted by tug boats and coal plant
personnel who fired water cannons as it entered the coal port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/greenpeace-flagship-rainbow-wa-4.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European energy companies such as the Belgium-based Suez Energy
International, part of the largest energy consortium in Western
Europe are involved with the expansion of the coal industry in
Thailand even though the European Union has committed to
drastically reduce its own carbon emissions by as much as 30
percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bangkok on July 21st we delivered our petition as Greenpeace
activists filled the Ministry of Energy headquarters with balloons
printed with the word "CO2". The balloons symbolize the carbon
emissions from the construction of new coal power plants in
Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25137/greenpeace-activists-protest-a.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the dirtiest, most carbon intensive of all fossil fuels.
Energy from coal now accounts for roughly 2 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Emitting 29% more carbon per unit of
energy than oil and 80% more than gas, coal is one of the leading
contributors to climate change. Burning coal also releases massive
amounts of toxic substances such as mercury and arsenic which have
deadly impacts on human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Thai government to quit coal and
increase energy efficiency. The government needs to adopt
legislation that provides investors in renewable energy with stable
and predictable returns and guarantee priority access to the grid
for renewable generators. Thailand doesn't need coal, it needs an
Energy Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Our ships rely on donations from people like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In a rare case of judicial farsightedness an Italian court has thrown out injunctions against 12 of our volunteers who took action against Italy's most polluting coal power plant. The court ruling even stated that the protest was 'justified due to the danger the coal plant to the local area'.

every year, to label it as the number one Italian cause of climate

&lt;p&gt;Local police responded by slapping unique injunctions on our 12
volunteers declaring them "socialmente pericolosi" (a danger to
society) and banning them from the local area for three years.
Normally only convicted criminals or mafia associates are
considered a "danger to society". This was the first time that
Italian police have used such an injunction for a peaceful
demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N6laJLy-Zqk&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly the real danger to society is massive coal plants
releasing millions of tonnes of global warming pollution every
year. In response hundreds of Italians also declared themselves
"banditi" for the climate, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.it/banditi/"&gt;posting their pictures on
our website&lt;/a&gt; in support of the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the injunctions were contested in the Court of Lecce the
judge over turned the injunctions and stated: "The demonstration
had justifiable and appreciable motivations in the high
environmental risk the power station poses to the whole area ...
the action has been a reaction to the polluting threat of the power
station, which negates the nature of the intrusion, which in
another case would be unacceptable".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Italian state and energy companies seeking to expand coal
power in Italy, this is clearly someone who can see the huge danger
of coal expansion. He would do a much better job than the
politicians currently in charge of Italian energy policy, like the
Ministry for Economic Development, Mr. Pierluigi Bersani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local community of Brindisi are also taking a stand against
the polluting coal plant. The town council has even proposed a
motion to give the ex-bandits honorary citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No climate for old coal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally plans for new coal plants have been hitting the
buffers. The most polluting form of energy generation is finally
coming under more scrutiny. Only vested interests are refusing to
acknowledge that new coal will blow any chance of meeting vital
climate targets. The plan for the first new coal plant in the UK
for decades has been delayed. In the US, of the 151 coal-fired
power plants in the planning stages during 2007, 59 proposed plants
were either refused licenses by state governments or quietly
abandoned. In addition, close to 50 coal plants are being contested
in the courts, and the remaining plants will likely be challenged
when they reach the permitting stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an Energy Revolution, not new coal. That means
investment in clean energy and enhanced energy efficiency measures.
Investing in renewable energy like wind energy and solar power, or
in combined heat and power plants - which take the excess heat
created by electricity generation and make it available for heating
rather than letting it dissipate into the atmosphere - can deliver
the CO2 savings we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal has no future if we are to tackle climate change - coal's
massive carbon emissions are the real danger to society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/7steps/"&gt;Take seven steps to help tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	In an historic move, the Romanian Government today announced it will ban genetically engineered (GE) maize and embrace organic agriculture. The move is particularly significant as GE maize is the only commercially cultivated GE crop permitted in Europe.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Monsanto's GMO corn threatens biodiversity.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister of Environment and Durable Development Mr Attila
Korodi's announcement banning Monsanto's GE maize MON 810, makes
Europe's largest per hectare maize producer GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My ministry is in possession of new scientific studies showing
that GE is not safe for human health or the environment," Korodi
said. "These are the same studies that have recently been used by
other European Union Member States such as France, Hungary, Austria
and Greece to justify the banning of Monsanto's GE maize MON
810...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We expect [the ban] to come into force around 15 April. Until
that time, we demand that Romanian farmers do not plant MON 810
seeds. The future of Romania is organic," he declared at an event
organised by Greenpeace, Slow Food and the Organic Farmers
Organisation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania cultivates about 3 million hectares of maize annually,
losing GE companies an important market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government's decision makes Romania the seventh of Europe's
leading maize producers to ban the growing of Monsanto's GE maize,
following France, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Greece and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/releases/seralini_study_MON863"&gt;
studies&lt;/a&gt; which have been significant in European governments'
decision to reject GE have shown MON 810 maize is harmful to
wildlife, soil and human health. Its inbuilt toxin, which is
designed to kill the cornborer, a pest considered insignificant in
Romania and other parts of Europe, seeps into soil harming animals
critical to soil health, such as earthworms, and other wildlife
including butterflies, ants and spiders. Proof of its safety for
human and animal health are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Romania's GE ban marks a seismic change. It sends a critical
message that this dangerous technology will not be tolerated. It is
vital the European Commission protects all of Europe's farmers,
consumers and environment by introducing an EU-wide ban against GE
cultivation," Geert Ritsema, Greenpeace International GE campaign
coordinator said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's 10-year licence, granted by the European Commission
to grow MON 810 throughout the EU, comes up for renewal later this
year. This provides an important opportunity for the Commission and
European Union (EU) Member States to reject GE once and for
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-eu-unit/press-centre/press-releases2/Dimas-call-for-maize-ban-071025"&gt;
Stavros Dimas&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commissioner for the Environment,
raised concerns over the safety of GE cultivation. But to date his
proposal to ban the growing of two GE maize varieties has been
blocked by President of the European Commission Manuel Barroso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Romanian people overwhelmingly reject this unsafe,
unnecessary and unsustainable technology," said Gabriel Paun, GE
Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace Romania. In 2007, a
Greenpeace-commissioned opinion poll conducted by Mercury Research
showed 67 percent of Romanians do not want to eat GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from safety concerns, GE also poses contamination threat
to natural crops. There have been 216 contamination events in 57
countries since GE crops were first grown commercially on a large
scale in 1996, as Greenpeace and GeneWatch UK's latest &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/gm-contamination-register-2007/"&gt;
GM Contamination Register Report&lt;/a&gt; shows.   Greenpeace is calling
for an international standard to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/gm-ge-contamination-report290208/"&gt;
hold biotech companies to account&lt;/a&gt; for the damage and financial
losses they cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a postcard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/solidarity-send-commissioner"&gt;Send EU Environment Commissioner Dimas a postcard encouraging him to keep standing up for life, biodiversity, health, beauty of nature -- and against reckless industry giants aiming for nothing else than control of the world's food and biodiversity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists from our ship Esperanza drove up to the coal ships
in inflatable boats, while they were anchored in the queue,
painting the messages along the sides of the waiting coal boats.
Police arrived on the scene after the 20 ships had been painted,
boarded one of the inflatables and arrested 10 activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/energyrevolution" target="_blank"&gt;Ask Kevin Rudd to join the Energy
[R]evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous Contradiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful action highlighted Australia's Prime Minister Kevin
Rudd's plans to rapidly expand coal exports at a time when the
world is trying to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst
talking about urgent action on climate change Rudd is overseeing
plans for Australia's first new coal port in decades and a doubling
of New South Wales' and Queensland's coal exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days ago in Port Douglas, he warned "Australia must act
locally and globally on the challenge of climate change because if
we fail great assets like the Great Barrier Reef will be fatally in
peril".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is the world's largest coal exporter by far,
accounting for 30 percent of global exports. The plans for coal
expansion in Queensland alone would increase Australia's current
emissions by 80 percent. Emissions from all of the planned
expansions total 729 million tonnes of CO2 - equal to 120 percent
of Australia's current emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new poll reveals that 82 percent of Australians want the
country's coal exports capped or reduced. Is Kevin Rudd going to
shape up to be the climate leader Australians hoped he would
be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his climate change review for the Australian federal
government, Professor Garnaut said that if we do not successfully
combat climate change, the Great Barrier Reef will die and
Australians will lose 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in tourism dollars
each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Queensland: the world's best solar
state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queensland has the best solar resources in the world, but
instead of leading the way in renewable energy, the 'Sunshine
State' has plans to massively expand its export coal industry. The
earth has enough renewable energy to power the globe six times over
forever. In Australia, all that's missing is the political
will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Rudd government acts now, Australia could become a
powerhouse for renewable energy manufacturing and technological
development, creating thousands of new jobs and investment
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having promised action on climate change, to prove he's serious,
Rudd must agree to replace ageing power stations with renewable
energy and halt the expansion of Australia's export coal industry.
Australia can't continue to burn coal and ship CO2 emissions
overseas and say that they are fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Without support from people like you - none of this would be possible. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The international convention that helped save the elephant and rhino from extinction at the hands of poachers is now being ignored by the Japanese Fisheries Agency to continue whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists in Japan demand illegal whale meat aboard the Panamanian-flagged Oriental Bluebird be refused by customs. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 22nd 2008, we documented with photographs and video
the transfer of whale meat from the Japanese registered factory
whaling ship, the Nissin Maru, to the Panamanian registered cargo
ship, the Oriental Bluebird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), it is illegal to trade
animals and plants listed on Appendix 1 across international
borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird has now docked in Tokyo Bay to unload it's
cargo of minke whale meat, completing the international trade that
started in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary over two months
ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 of CITES lists nearly 900 plant and animal species
and includes all the 'great' whales like humpback, fin and minke
whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has filed what is known as a 'reservation' to the listing
of many whale species on Appendix 1, which allows it to ignore some
restrictions on trade in minke whales. But, because Panama has
ratified the treaty without reservations, it cannot commercially
import or export minke whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfering the whale meat from the Japanese registered Nissin
Maru to the Panamanian registered Oriental Bluebird, which then
unloads the meat in a Japanese port is therefore illegal under both
the rules of CITES and Panamanian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan's research whaling programme is a national
embarrassment," said Greenpeace Japan Whales Project Leader Junichi
Sato, "it is riddled with illegalities and instances where
international law has been bent, broken, and bypassed; it continues
to strain relations with our allies around the world and tarnish
Japan's reputation. It's time for Japan to stop whaling in the
Southern Ocean forever."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was set up in 1973 to protect animals
and plants against over-exploitation through international
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Get your FREE Greenpeace newsletter delivered straight to your inbox with all the latest whale news and ways you can help end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for good by making a donation today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Europe stands on the verge of a great opportunity. Its fleet of power stations, built thirty years ago is reaching the end of its life. With climate change an undeniable threat, this is a once in a lifetime chance to turn our back on fossil fuels and embrace the energy revolution. A revolution which could bring greenhouse gas emissions under control, and help prevent catastrophic climate change.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists plant 2,008 trees on the construction site of the new E.ON coal power plant in Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam. Ironically today is the, "national day for planting a tree", sponsored by E.ON.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shame then that the power companies who could do most to
support that shift are doing their best to secure another thirty
years of business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Netherlands - trees against coal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, German power company E.ON plan to build a
new coal fired power station, another four are also planned by
other utilities. Last week Greenpeace won an injunction halting the
construction from going ahead because E.ON does not have an
operating licence for the plant, only a construction permit. Our
lawsuit secures a window of opportunity to prevent the construction
from going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seizing the opportunity, today, while E.ON has been seeking to
improve its image by sponsoring "national tree day", around 100
Greenpeace activists celebrated the event by planting thousands of
trees on the proposed site of the company's new power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Germany - giant metal dinosaur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/vattenfall-hq-protest"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25205/vattenfall-hq-protest.jpg" border="0" height="323" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, Vattenfall are another company building new coal
fired power plants. Once again, Greenpeace is leading the fight to
stop them. The three new plants proposed by Vattenfall would pump
out some 18.2 million tonnes of carbon per year. Coal power
stations should go the way of the dinosaurs, and Greenpeace made
that point by delivering a 5-meter tall dinosaur and three tonnes
of coal to Vattenfalls' headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Vattenfall plant at Moorburg the subject of discussions
between Germany's Christian Democrats and Greens, as they seek to
form a new provincial government, there is a real chance to do the
right thing and consign this power plant to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Better ideas on offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal companies try to disguise their filthy investments by
talking up the prospect of implementing Carbon Capture and Storage
(&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/CCS-briefing"&gt;
CCS&lt;/a&gt;) technology. Just one of the problems? We need carbon
reductions now, but Vattenfall say their first 'commercial concept'
will be ready between 2015 and 2020  - too late to make a
difference, even it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe doesn't face up to the coal industry it will have to
face up to the consequences of climate change. Fortunately there is
an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs an Energy Revolution.  That means investment in
clean energy and enhanced energy efficiency measures. Investing in
renewable energy like wind energy and solar power, or in combined
heat and power plants - which take the excess heat created by
electricity generation and make it available for heating rather
than letting it dissipate into the atmosphere - can deliver the CO2
savings we need. More demanding energy efficiency standards for
everything from light bulbs and fridges to cars will ensure the
economy continues to grow even as it decarbonises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/7steps/"&gt;Take 7 steps to help the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

<item><language>en</language><title>Argentina to 'Ban the Bulb'</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/</url><text>
	As the energy revolution gathers pace in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, Argentina becomes the latest country to announce that it is banning energy wasting bulbs.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A 5 metre high 'ban the bulb' display in front of the Argentinean Congress.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, over 10 countries have committed to banning the bulb with another half a dozen countries planning to do the same or using initiatives to effectively consign the old incandescent bulb to the dustbin of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="#table"&gt;Check out who is on the right path to banning the bulb and starting their energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina's move to ban the bulb by 2010 is the first legislative step taken by a South American country to rid itself of inefficient lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign victory comes after a very active &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/prensa-rss/greenpeace-manifest-su-acuerd" target="blank"&gt;'ban the bulb' campaign by our Argentinean office&lt;/a&gt;. In announcing the move at an energy efficiency conference, President Kirchner praised our campaign by saying, "we are following the proposal from Greenpeace".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela and Cuba have given out the more efficient compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs for free to its citizens whilst Brazil has subsidised the cost of CFL's but none of them have passed legislation banning them outright as Argentina now intends to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A product from the 19th century has no place in today's society. To protect the climate we need to set strong efficiency standards" said Rosario Espina from Greenpeace Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to reduce its carbon output by 80 percent by 2050 if it is to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Banning inefficient lighting is a good first step but it is not enough on its own to stop human induced climate change in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the efficiency of all household appliances, buildings, cars, etc and switching to renewable energy can achieve the required carbon savings to avoid the catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Japanese whalers have announced that they are struggling to harpoon their quota this year.  As the season draws to a close, they have caught less than half the 985 whales they targeted.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace dogged the whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean, shutting down the whalers for longer than ever before.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping the whaling fleet's factory ship on the run in
January our non-violent protests were vital in frustrating the
Japanese Fisheries Agency's plans, as the whalers tried to avoid
public scrutiny by not killing whales in our presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the support of millions of people like you we could not
have sent our ship, the Esperanza, to the Southern Ocean, or
generated enough controversy to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
cause Japan to call off their humpback hunt before it had even
started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only a couple of weeks left in the hunting season, and
by their own admission the owners of the whaling ships will not be
off-loading anything like the planned 1,000 whales worth of boxed
and frozen whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whale meat from the start of the hunt is due to arrive
back in Japan in the next few days - destined to sit in warehouse
stockpiles as potential whale meat buyers in Japan are themselves
becoming a vanishing species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in January, as well as shutting down the whale operations
for longer than ever before,  we peacefully disrupted the refueling
of the Japanese whaling fleet by the tanker Oriental Bluebird.
Following the refueling, huge amounts of whale meat were
transferred to the Oriental Bluebird for transit back to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird doesn't have a permit as part of Japan's
research whaling fleet, and is flagged as a Panamanian vessel. Both
Panama and Japan have signed the international Convention on the
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which prohibits commercial
trade in species named on its Appendix 1 list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minke whale is an Appendix 1 species, and while Japan has
filed for an exception to the regulations, Panama has not. The meat
now steaming towards Japan all boxed up and ready for sale has,
according to law, been exported to Panamanian territory -- and the
Greenpeace ship Esperanza has photos to document that. Any
offloading of the whale meat in Japan could constitute a violation
of the CITES convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the whale meat is offloaded, we'll be ashore to voice
the opposition of whale defenders around the world. Greenpeace
Japan has been urging supermarkets and restaurants not to offer
whale meat. Three of the top five supermarkets chains have
responding positively. 'Watami', a famous pub chain, with over 600
restaurants all over Japan, has also confirmed that whale is off
the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer and fewer people in Japan are eating whale meat, leading
to declining demand and an unsold stockpile of nearly 4,000 tonnes
of whale meat. In a desperate attempt by the bureaucrats of the
Japanese Fisheries Agency to reverse the trend and create
artificial support for their unpopular product, the whale meat has
been subsidised, pushed into school lunches and even used as dog
food. A company charged with marketing the meat has for two years
running failed to turn a profit, and the whalers this year had to
reorganise payment of an interest-free government loan, as they've
been unable to meet their sales targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial whaling has no future -- whether it's disguised as
scientific research or not.  In Norway, the number one buyer of
whale meat &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/03/will_nobody_buy_their_whale_me.html"&gt;
announced that they're getting out of the whale meat business&lt;/a&gt;.
In Iceland, the Minister of Fisheries &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/08/iceland_to_stop_whaling.html"&gt;
announced last year that no quota was being set&lt;/a&gt; because there
was no market for the whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With steady pressure, we can ensure that whaling is consigned to
the history books forever, and that in future whales are shot by
the cameras of whale watchers, rather than the harpoons of
so-called researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Sony Vaio TZ11 laptop, Sony Ericsson T650i mobile phone and Sony Ericsson P1i PDA have come out on top in our first survey of greener electronics products. Some products were more advanced than others, but there's definitely room for improvement as none of them scored over 5/10.

            A pile of e-waste at CeBit 2008.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25213/searching-for-green-electronics.pdf"&gt;
survey of the main brands&lt;/a&gt; of desktop PCs and notebooks, mobile
phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), assessing them on
their use of hazardous chemicals, energy efficiency, overall
product lifecycle (recyclability and upgradeability) and other
factors such as the promotion of environmental friendliness and
innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#video" class="act"&gt;Check out the e-waste video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted market leaders and invited them to submit their
most environmentally-friendly products currently available. In
addition, we placed ads in trade magazines and on websites
encouraging other producers to participate. Each company could
submit a maximum of three products in each of the product
categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven products were assessed, from fourteen major
electronics brands who agreed to provide information for the survey
at the end of 2007. The companies submitted information on their
most environmentally-friendly products. Sony Vaio TZ11 notebook,
the Sony Ericsson T650i mobile phone and the Sony Ericsson P1i PDA
came out top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best rated desktop came from Dell (Optiplex 755) and HP
(dc5750) but these and other mobile phones, laptops and PDAs didn't
score above 5/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey was based on voluntary participation by companies
willing to submit their products to our critical evaluation.
Unfortunately, not all the companies we invited agreed to
participate, and in the game consoles category in particular we
received either no submissions at all or they came too late to be
included. Non-responders included: Acer, Apple, Microsoft, Nintendo
and Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since submissions closed, several companies have launched
products that showcase new environmental innovations. Nokia's
Evolve phone uses more recycled plastic and has a highly efficient
charger. Apple's Mac Book Air eliminates the use of toxic mercury
and arsenic to raise the bar on toxics reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the electronics industry is moving fast we are at the
world's biggest IT fair - CeBIT in Germany, to check out which
companies and products are on the cutting edge of environmental
innovation. Our experts will be investigating the facts behind the
hype and highlighting the leaders and showing up any superficial
green claims. Check out the updates on green innovations at
CeBIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/electronics/"&gt;
our blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey also reveals that while no individual product could
yet lay claim to being truly green, there are plenty of individual
innovations by different companies in toxics reduction, energy
efficiency, longer lifecycles and recycling. The key to making a
comprehensively greener product is combining innovation in each of
these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to challenge electronics manufacturers to take
responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products - from
production, through manufacture and to the very end of their
products' lives - and to clean up their products by eliminating
hazardous substances and replacing harmful ingredients through
safer alternatives or design changes while producing energy
efficient products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers need to embrace a truly comprehensive approach.
Consumers should not have to choose between a toxic free product or
an energy-efficient one. They should not need to ask if being
recyclable is better than being durable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a product offers all those standards and is marketed with
consumer-friendly services extending the lifespan as much as
possible, then we can say there is a true green electronics product
on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

	Do you know what happens when you throw out your old electronic gadgets? Probably not, but considering they contain both toxic chemicals and valuable metals you'd think someone would know? Unfortunately our new report 'Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard' reveals the fate of millions of tonnes of e-waste generated each year is largely unknown.

            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of old electronics, or e-waste, such as computers, phones and TVs being discarded every year is growing rapidly. In many countries it's the fastest growing type of waste as cheap prices mean replacing electronics is cheaper than fixing them, while low price often means low quality and a very short life spans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As electronics increasingly become part of the throw away culture in many developed countries, amounts of e-waste have dramatically increased while solutions have often lagged far behind. Even in the European Union (EU) that has tighter regulation 75 percent of e-waste is unaccounted for. Of the estimated 8.7 million tonnes of e-waste created annually in the EU a massive 6.6 million tonnes of e-waste is not recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US there is very little regulation of e-waste. Less than 20 percent of US e-waste is recovered for recycling. Worrying the recycling percentages for PCs (10 percent) and TVs (14 percent) are even lower. The imminent switch to digital TVs in the US and elsewhere will lead to a massive increase in the amount of redundant analogue TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even from the 20 percent of e-waste collected in the US much is exported  because the US is one of the few countries where it's still legal to export collected e-waste to Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/e-waste-china-toxic-label.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;E-waste dumped in China, with a label clearly indicating it was collected for recycling in California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge amount of e-waste not recycled can be accounted for by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Storage: Often old electronics are stored in people's houses. This only serves to delay the day they are finally discarded and reduces the chances they could be effectively reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Landfill/Incineration: When mixed with domestic waste electronics will most likely end up in a landfill or incinerated. Both methods allow toxic chemicals to pollute the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Reuse and Export: Old computers and phones are often exported to developing countries for reuse or recycling. The vast majority are crudely recycled in e-waste scrap yards causing widespread pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Divide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries like India and China have long been a destination for e-waste dumping by unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick profit on e-waste from the US and Europe. Now the amounts of domestic e-waste generated by these countries is growing fast. In India only one percent of e-waste is collected for authorised recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Asia and Africa informal recycling yards have sprung up where low paid migrant workers use primitive methods to extract valuable metals. This informal recycling creates massive environmental pollution and damages the health of workers and residents in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even well intentioned shipments of computers for reuse are being abused. In &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-trash/carroll-text"&gt; Ghana many traders report&lt;/a&gt; that to get a shipping container with a few working computers they must accept broken junk like old screens in the same container from exporters in developed countries. The broken junk and eventually even the working computers inevitably ends up dumped in Ghana where there is no infrastructure to safely recycle toxic e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clear solution is for the major electronics companies to eliminate the worst toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling programs. Having generated demand for the latest new mobile phone or sleek laptop and made vast profits from sales of electronics it should not be a problem the companies are allowed to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/old-mobile-phones-e-waste.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Mobiles at a recycling plant. Only a fraction of old mobiles are recycled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 more than one billion mobile phones were shipped worldwide. However, Nokia (the market leader) recycles just 2 percent of the phones it sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major computer makers do little better, with currently an average recycling rate of just 9 percent. That means the major companies don't recycle over 90 percent of their old products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the rising tide of e-waste all manufactures must offer free and convenient recycling of their products to all their customers. Where companies are unwilling to do this tough legislation is need to ensure electronics are safely recycled. Japan has effective recycling legislation and Sony reports that it collects 53 percent of it's old products in Japan. That's five times better than the global average for major PC makers and shows that solutions are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace calls on Philips to take-back &amp;amp; recycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25217/philips.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most companies accept responsibility for recycling their own products, and are improving their recycling programs for consumers, several TV companies are dragging their feet on recycling with the majority offering no recycling for old TVs in many countries. Of the TV companies, Philips stands out by publicly stating that recycling is the responsibility for the customer and government and consumers should pay for recycling, not the product makers. Behind the scenes Philips lobbies to avert legislation to make companies more responsible for recycling their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Philips is helping ensure the status quo remains, that has lead to such a large e-waste problem. We have delivered this report direct to Phillips and other companies to show how they need to stop hiding from the problem of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-waste: The good, the bad and the ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since August 2006 we have been &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; ranking the major electronics companies' efforts&lt;/a&gt; phase out toxic chemicals and improve recycling programs - both vital steps to tackle e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies have made big strides to improve their products and recycling schemes since the introduction of the Guide. But no company has so far succeeded in offering an entire range of products free of the worst toxic chemicals or a comprehensive, free, global takeback scheme to ensure responsible recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We never allow ourselves to be fed by a hand we might want to bite. Not accepting corporate donations means we rely entirely on people like you to help keep us going. Some of our corporate targets spend in a few hours what we spend in an entire year. Please help with anything you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A shipping container filled with sawn timber from an eco-forestry project in Lake Murray, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has arrived in Sydney, Australia.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/men-from-the-village-of-aweika.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Men from the village of Aweikaimqassi work together to prepare a freshly cut tree for milling on a portable sawmill, as part of a local eco-forestry project.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the eco-forestry project, we teamed up with the local
people and set up the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/paradiseforests/"&gt;Global Forest
Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt;on the shore of Lake Murray in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue station was used as thebase for surveying the
surrounding forest to determine traditional clanboundaries, and
training for the local communities in land and businessmanagement,
marketing and timber milling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the arrival of the first shipment of taun, rosewood
and red cedar to Australia, Lake Murray landowner, Sep Galeva said
that while it had taken his people a lot of hard work over the last
few years to get the timber exported, this was just the first of
many containers to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#video" class="act"&gt;Watch the video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we have shown is that anybody can do this. Forest
communities around PNG don't have to rely on industrial logging for
survival, they can do it themselves in a way that protects the
environment and keeps the land for future generations," Mr Galeva
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our bad experience with illegal and destructive logging from
the Kiunga Aiambak road project, run by Concord Pacific, made my
people choose eco-forestry instead so that we have control over our
land."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Sam Moko added, "By doing this they
willcontinue to enjoy all the benefits their forests traditionally
providethem and get real income from cutting their timber for
generations tocome."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There has been a lot of pressure on communities in LakeMurray
to sign their land away to logging and palm oil interests
andlandowners need to make informed decisions before they agree to
the bigcompanies, otherwise they could find themselves regretting
theirdecision and facing ongoing social, environmental and legal
issues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"TheLake Murray people involved in eco-forestry have thought
about theiroptions and have decided to take their future in their
own hands."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Lake Murray approached Greenpeace, the Foundation
for People and Community Development (FPCD), Barefoot and other
non-government organisations to help them get their eco-forestry
project off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yati Bun, Executive Director of FPCD, this kind of
initiative is a way for landowners to take charge of their forest
resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We joined the Lake Murray initiative to support landowners
manage the forests themselves and make sure they are getting the
maximum benefits," Mr Bun said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are earning 2-3 times what they would get locally from
logging companies for their sawn timber. Over the long term
eco-forestry provides economic, social and environmental benefits
to local communities, empower them to be self sufficient and
ensures their valuable forest resource survives into the
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want other PNG forest owners to know that eco-forestry is a
viable alternative to logging, and that they can make very good
returns exporting timber to Australia but they also need to know
that it is not easy. If people want to choose to control their own
destinies they must commit themselves to working hard and not sit
back and expect things to just come to them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lake Murray eco-forestry initiative has been supported by
funding from Doen Foundation in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace blockades Australian coal-fired power station</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-blockades-australia/</url><text>
	Greenpeace activists, including an ex-miner from the Hunter Valley, blockaded Australia's most polluting coal-fired power station to call for an Energy [R]evolution. Entering the plant in the early hours of the morning, 16 activists were able to lock themselves to the conveyors that distribute the coal.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/7/activist-inside-eraring-power.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activist inside Eraring Power Station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the last activists had been removed from the site,
coal supply had been halted for about five hours - for every hour
supply was stopped, we prevented 2000 tonnes of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; from being released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd's turn to act on
climate change and energy. Greenpeace's Australian supporters are
being asked to sign a petition urging Rudd to commit to phasing out
dirty coal and building a clean, safe and reliable energy future
for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Eraring power station?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia-Pacific's climate and energy campaigner,
Simon Roz, explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to stop fuelling climate change when creating
electricity. Eraring is old and inefficient - it's Australia's
dirtiest coal-fired power plant, sending nearly 20 million tonnes
of greenhouse pollution into the atmosphere every year. It's one of
the eight coal-fired power stations in New South Wales responsible
for half the state's and 13% of Australia's greenhouse
pollution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the activists blockading the coal conveyor was Graham
Brown, a retired Hunter Valley coal miner. He said, "I feel very
strongly that we must start making the transition from coal-power
to renewable energy. Coal communities have been taken advantage of
by coal companies and governments. Renewable energy is the future,
and it's bright. Workers must be retrained and re-skilled so that
they don't miss out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable technology is already there, we don't have to wait 20
years for it - but we need a transition mechanism in place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action came in advance of Australian government's climate
change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, delivering his draft review
on climate change. Any urgent action to be taken on climate change
must include policies that support renewables to replace dirty
coal-fired power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon Roz says, "Renewable energy can replace coal-fired
power and would be a huge step forward in reducing emissions in
line with Professor Garnaut's recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is just the latest of many countries in which
Greenpeace has released national Energy [R]evolution reports
showing how renewables combined with energy efficiency, can provide
all of that country's energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace released its global &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energyrevolutionreport/" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The
scenario shows how renewables can replace coal by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become an Energy [R]evolutionary!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;Send a message to world leaders who are meeting at the G8 Summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU and become energy [r]evolutionaries! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediterranean pirates busted by Greenpeace</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Mediterranean-pirates-busted070708/</url><text>
	Activists aboard our ship Arctic Sunrise confronted an illegal vessel, the Luna Rossa, fishing with a driftnet this morning in international waters west of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea. The Luna Rossa’s crew immediately cut the net and fled from our ship at high speed.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/the-pirate-fishing-vessel-lun.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/the-pirate-fishing-vessel-lun.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The pirate fishing vessel, Luna Rossa, cut off its illegal driftnet and fled from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driftnets  - described as "walls of death" because of the way in
which they indiscriminately snare not just their target species,
but everything in their path -  killing whales, dolphins and
turtles in addition to other marine life, have been banned by the
United Nations and the European Union. Our activists retrieved the
illegal net and we reported the vessel to the relevant authorities
in Italy and the European Union - though so far with no
response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;They can run but they can't hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the helicopter on the Arctic Sunrise has been
repaired - &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/attacking-the-messenger300608/" title="The Attack" target="_blank"&gt;it was damaged when the ship
was attacked by Turkish fishermen a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; - and so we
were able to catch up with the Luna Rossa to get its name and
number, despite the crew's attempts to hide this information from
us with tarpaulin, buoys and footballs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were clearly unimpressed about Greenpeace turning up as
they were hauling their illegal catch. They made rude gestures,
exposed their buttocks and hurled abuse at our activists over the
radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="311"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2008/7/ssmeddriftnet08.swf"&gt;

&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;No time for talking&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is exposing these pirates but the real
responsibility for enforcing the driftnet ban lies with the Italian
government and the European Union. Yet Mediterranean governments
continue to turn a blind eye to these activities, essentially
condoning the crimes and failing in their mandate to protect the
Mediterranean Sea from such acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of fully
protected marine reserves covering 40% of our oceans as an
essential way to protect our seas from the ravages of climate
change, to restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean
life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this campaign, the Arctic Sunrise is currently in the
Mediterranean documenting threats to the sea and promoting the
designation of marine reserves. Our three-month expedition -
"Defending Our Mediterranean" - began in May, and we have already
confronted &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/fishing-out-the-pirates/" title="The other Italian vessel" target="_blank"&gt;Italian driftnet
fishing vessels&lt;/a&gt; and Turkish purse seiners targeting bluefin
tuna. We have also mapped and documented seagrass meadows requiring
protection in Greece and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Sea is in crisis and the industry is fishing
itself to death. Swordfish stocks are dwindling, and driftnets go
on reaping a deadly bycatch. Bluefin tuna is set to share the same
fate as cod in the north Atlantic, and vital fish breeding and
feeding areas like seagrass meadows continue to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are urging all Mediterranean countries to unite and protect
their sea - to stop illegal fishing and preserve their shared
marine resources. Laws without enforcement are worthless. It's time
to stop talking about protection and start taking real action to
stop the plunder. If we want fish for the future, we need marine
reserves now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Help our oceans recover by joining the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;The Arctic Sunrise continues to defend the Mediterranean and we rely on donations from people all over the world to keep our ships going. Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>G8 - Environment Nil!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/g8-environment-nil-09072008/</url><text>
	When you're in the business of saving the future - and you give yourself a specific deadline, such as 2050 - you need to make sure that every single day between then and now counts. Unfortunately, the G8 Summit was a waste of three whole days. Gathering in Toyako, Japan, G8 leaders offered nothing new on the food crisis, gave the wrong answer to rising oil prices and deferred climate action. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2005/6/president-george-w-bush.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2005/6/president-george-w-bush.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            George Bush attends his last ever G8 Summit - so it's not all bad news, then...
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our political advisor, Daniel Mittler, who was in Toyako
throughout, has been providing regular updates: from the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/rain_in_a_ski_resort_a_sad_but.html" target="_blank"&gt;wet and dismal start to the proceedings&lt;/a&gt;,
through the G8's &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/solving_the_food_crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;working lunches, working dinners and working
lunches while discussing the global food crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and to the
bitter end - a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/07/g8_climate_statement_this_is_a.html" target="_blank"&gt;final statement&lt;/a&gt; that showed they hadn't made
much progress whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned from the G8's three wasted days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1.    Never do today what you can keep putting off until
tomorrow...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global emissions have to start falling by 2015 and must be cut
by more than 50 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. With the
G8 countries accounting for 62 percent of greenhouse gas emissions,
it's clear that industrialised countries need to take the lead,
cutting emissions by at least 30 percent by 2020, and by between 80
and 90 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 in fact called on the world to aim for a 50 percent goal
- and not more - in 2050, and failed to give any clear commitments
on mid-term measures; this is simply not good enough. We need
action today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/ENVIRONMENT/EXTCC/0,,contentMDK:21713769~menuPK:4860081~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:407864,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;World Bank Climate Investment Funds&lt;/a&gt; that the
G8 has announced do not even exclude coal, the world's most
polluting energy source. Unless we end our addiction to fossil
fuels and start an energy revolution based on renewable energy and
energy efficiency now, the world of 2050 will be a nightmarish one
indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the G8 leaders have effectively done is postpone the
responsibility for tackling global climate change to future
generations; to the politicians who succeed them, and to the
children who will have to live in the nightmare world of 2050 as
envisioned by the G8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.    Never miss the opportunity - whatever the crisis - to
make a quick sale…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush, Berlusconi and others have used the G8 meeting to act as
lobbyists for their own energy giants, trying to sell dangerous,
expensive and uninsurable nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fact that nuclear energy today is based on risky
reactors, leads to proliferation and security hazards and produces
long lived deadly nuclear waste with no solution for its safe
disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that nuclear power will save the climate is absurd and
downright dangerous. We need solutions based on renewables and
energy efficiency to defeat climate change and ensure true energy
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not even as though it's difficult for the G8 to find these
solutions - we set it all out, loud and clear, for them in our &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25145/energyrevolutionreport.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution scenario&lt;/a&gt; last year. Maybe
it's time for the G8 leaders to get their heads down into reading
this report, instead of having their heads in the (hopefully, not
mushroom-shaped) clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.    You can have your cake &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; eat it - so long as
it's genetically modified…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's said, "You are what you eat." Yet, the G8 continues to
support treating our soil like dirt, contaminating our water with
toxic chemicals and the planting of more GE crops that yield less
and fail under bad weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial agriculture has undermined global food security and
led us to a food crisis. Rather than shift public investment to
proven ecological methods that provide higher yields, better food
and more resilience to climate change, the G8 leaders repeat their
usual mantra that countries should rely on the global market for
their food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, Bush, Berlusconi and others have been pushing
for genetically engineered food as the solution to the food crisis.
They pretend that liberalising trade will lower food prices. It has
not and will not - all it will do is drive poor farmers, especially
those in the developing world, off their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need farming that is ecological and biodiverse, rather than
continuing with chemical-intensive farming or pursuing the false
promise of genetic engineering. We need public investment in
research and development on ecological and climate change resilient
farming; the end of funding for GE crops and the prohibition of
patents on seeds; and the phasing out of the most toxic chemicals
and the elimination of environmentally-destructive agricultural
subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time for G8 leaders to admit that their old policies have
failed and that they need to start building a trade system based on
equity and sustainability; that 'business as usual' is not an
option. Instead, they fell back on their usual ritual of calling
for a swift end to the Doha Round of trade talks, failing to
recognise that further trade liberalisation will spell disaster for
poor people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Daniel Mittler's reports show, the G8 leaders had plenty of
food…but little thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4.    Acknowledge the problem, and hopefully it'll go
away…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G8 acknowledged there are unsustainable biofuels - but
didn't do anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this inaction even more land will be diverted away from
food production - mandatory biofuel targets in developed countries
need to be suspended and legislation introduced to ensure biofuel
production does not threaten food security, particularly in
developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And due to this inaction, even more forests will be felled -
increasing global climate change.  Protecting intact forests is
crucial for preserving biodiversity and combating climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is running out, but the answer to the world's transport
needs does not lie with unsustainable biofuels. In order to satisfy
the rich world's addiction to cars, instead we are simply driving
deforestation, driving the food crisis and driving climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the G8 may have driven through all the climate red
lights and stop signs in Toyako.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5.    Always look on the bright side of life…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Arctic ice is melting, the G8 froze into inaction.
Instead of protecting the climate, the G8 effectively protected the
interests of industry, most notably the nuclear and GE industries.
We're no further forward than where we were a year ago, at the last
G8 meeting in Heiligendamm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;But, the one good thing about this G8
meeting is that it was US President George W. Bush's last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any money from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Facing up to illegal forest destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eu-illegal-timber-law-020708/</url><text>
	Illegal logging often happens in far-off places that are all too easily ignored. That's why we have brought the problem to the heart of Europe - with a 12-metre Amazon tree trunk placed in Brussels to highlight the role of Europe in fuelling the destruction of the world's rainforests.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists take the message "Ban illegal timber" to the EU Commission Headquarters.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed Brazilian artist Siron Franco has installed nine video
monitors into the trunk of an Amazon tree that comes from an area
in Brazil where illegal logging is rampant. The tree has been
placed outside the European Commission's headquarters and contrasts
images of the natural beauty of the rainforest with the ongoing
destruction caused by illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is part of our ongoing campaign to force the EU
to introduce a new timber law. This would see a long overdue ban on
illegal timber being sold in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Environment Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, and other EU
politicians are planning to visit the tree, where our activists
will present them with a plywood postcard reading: 'Stop the
chainsaw massacre! Adopt EU timber law now' to remind them why it
is vital to protect the world's last remaining rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Europe buys millions of tonnes of timber from
areas such as the Amazon, South East Asia and the Congo, where
illegal and destructive logging is rampant. As a result, customers
in Europe, buying products like garden furniture, paper tissues,
and construction materials, are unwitting accomplices in the
destruction of the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, the EU has been promising to introduce
new laws against illegally harvested timber, but those companies
profiteering from illegal logging have been obstructing the efforts
being made by the European Commission. However, on July 23, the
European Commission will finally vote on whether to adopt a new
law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the European Commission hasn't got much choice
if it is serious about tackling climate change. We urgently need to
stop destroying the world's forests. Practices such as illegal and
destructive logging drive deforestation, which in turns leads to
the dramatic loss of species and accounts for one fifth of global
greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our supporters have been instrumental in making sure
that the issue hasn't fallen off of the Commission's agenda. Since
June 17, over &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;
65,000 letters have been sent&lt;/a&gt; to the EU President, José Manuel
Barroso. Progressive companies working in the timber industry have
also been pushing for the new law - they are suffering at the hands
of rogue businesses involved in illegal and destructive logging who
undercut prices, make sustainable wood less competitive and harm
the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU already has strict controls on illegal music, software
and films. It's high time timber stolen from the world's last
rainforests was just as strictly controlled as pirate CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;Please write to President Barroso today for a strong EU timber law.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Global protest continues to mount with protests and vigils in front of Japanese embassies around the world and more than 180,000  190,000 200,000 letters being sent to the Japanese government demanding the release of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki -- the Tokyo Two. A network of Japanese lawyers have called the arrests a violation of human rights and a challenge to the freedom of expression in Japan.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/hollanda.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/7/hollanda.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists conduct peaceful protests at Japanese embassies around the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru have been under arrest since the 20th of June,
held without charge. On Tuesday, July 1st, a hearing will be held
on whether they will be detained for a further ten days without
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;UPDATE July 1, 2008:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has ruled Junichi and Toru will spend the maximum time
in custody without charge permissible under Japanese law - 23
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a message to supporters, sent via their lawyers, Junichi and
Toru welcomed the outporing of efforts from people all over the
world, adding: "We still need your help. We have been ordered to
remain in custody for ten more days without charge. Please
encourage your friends to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;send an email to the
Japanese government&lt;/a&gt;, if they have not already. Keep watching
for news from Greenpeace of more actions you can take and make sure
that the global demand to investigate the whale meat scandal we
exposed is heard loud and clear here in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru exposed a whale-meat embezzlement scandal on
May 15th by presenting a box of whale meat stolen by crew of
Japan's so-called "scientific whaling" fleet, to the Tokyo Public
Prosecutor along with a dossier documenting how they obtained it. 
The scam, in which prime cuts of whale meat are smuggled off the
ship by crewmembers and sold outside official channels, appears to
have been running for years with the full awareness of the
officials that conduct the whaling expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="slideshowmx" align="middle" height="311" width="430"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling programme is funded by taxpayers, at a cost
of 500 million yen a year (4.7 million)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosecutor's office took up an investigation, but concluded
there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges against any of
the crew or whaling officials. The only consequences in the case
were for the Greenpeace activists, who intercepted a box of meat as
evidence, and were arrested in dramatic raids on their homes and
offices, conducted by around 40 police officers in front of
television cameras.  The police seized documents, computers, cell
phones, and the Greenpeace Japan supporter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;"The response by the Japanese authorities can only
be described as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;excessive, unjust and politically motivated...Rather than trying
to silence those who point out corruption, the police should be
investigating the government officials, whaling fleet operators and
staff who smuggle whale meat from the so-called scientific
programme funded by Japanese taxpayers and sell it for profit. This
and the ongoingwhaling operation in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is where the forces of justice should be focussed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="source"&gt;Gerd Leipold, Executive Director, Greenpeace
International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other voices in Japan are saying that the arrest was a warning
to other activist groups that as the G8 approaches, voices of
dissent in Japan will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=4853" target="_blank"&gt;Kyodo&lt;/a&gt; Reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;    While he disagrees with
Greenpeace's anti-whaling stance, journalist Takao Saito said the
way the police arrested the two men and the way they investigated
the group was heavy-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"(Greenpeace) is functioning as a
whistleblower in our society so the authorities should give them a
fair hearing to what they have to say."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WATCH, a network of laywers keeping an eye on human rights in
Japan in the run up to the G8, issued a &lt;a href="http://watch08summit.blogspot.com/2008/06/we-strongly-protest-against-detention.html"&gt;
statement&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"The arrest of the two activists is
not only a human rights violation with regard to the unjustifiable
arrest, detention and investigation, but also a challenge against
the freedom of expression. Police repression against the activists'
denunciation obstructs the legitimate activities of both Japanese
civil society and international society and is therefore
internationally unacceptable and subject to global criticism as an
affront to humanity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supporters have launched protests from Budapest to
Sydney, Sao Paolo to Jakarta, Athens to Washington, and points in
between:&lt;/p&gt;

governments. Vigils and demonstrations are held outside Japanese
embassies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story prompts people all around the world to take
extraordinary action. Now another hero steps up to do what must be
done. Help Mister Splashy Pants free the Tokyo Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is this Mister Splashy Pants dude, you ask? In the real
world, he's a humpback whale we &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
tracked with a satellite tag&lt;/a&gt; heading from the Solomon Islands
toward the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary -- that safe haven in
which the Japanese government kills around 1,000 whales every year
for "scientific research." He was named in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Splashy_Pants"&gt;online
competition&lt;/a&gt; in which his share of the 100,000 votes clobbered
all rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Japanese whalers were heading toward the Southern
Ocean planning to add humpbacks to the whale species they kill
every year. Public pressure from whale supporters worldwide brought
diplomatic protest to bear, however, and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/humpbacks-to-be-spared-the-har/"&gt;
Japanese backed down on plans to kill humpbacks&lt;/a&gt; -- for now,
anyway. (They still kill minke and fin whales, but our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/551-whales-too-many-140408/"&gt;
direct non-violent actions helped ensure they killed fewer of them
this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants was saved by whale activists like you,
Junichi and Toru. So he reckoned it was time to return the favour.
Help him out by spreading the word: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;Free the Tokyo
Two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers embarks on a synchronized propaganda campaign aligned with Alberta's "rebranding" of its oil-extracting tar sands project, Greenpeace has launched its own website to paint the greenwash in its true colour: a deep, oily black.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://travellingalberta.com/"&gt;TravellingAlberta.com&lt;/a&gt;
is a tongue-in-cheek travel site that uses humour to communicate a
very serious issue to Canadian and international audiences about
the destructive nature of the world's largest industrial
development. The website showcases  some of the unique attractions
that await travelers to Alberta: Black sand beaches, toxic lakes
and clearcut forests. Until now, this kind of vacation destination
was merely the stuff of science fiction; but now, it can be
experienced first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We thought we'd help the province and the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers  with their "rebranding" campaign by
bringing Alberta's newest tourist attractions to the world's
doorstep. Any visitor to the Alberta tar sands can see the
pollution, smell the sulfur, taste the toxins and hear the air
cannons - we're saving them the trip," says Mike Hudema, a tar
sands campaigner with Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Premier Ed Stelmach and theCanadian Association of Petroleum
Producers can spend 25 million dollars of tax payers' money trying
to cleanup the image of the tar sands, but this development is
still dirty, ugly and foul. That money would be much better spent
cleaning up the tar sands themselves, rather than just the global
image."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a real cleanup of the area is still a way off, the
current state of northern Alberta offers a rare treat for the
seasoned globetrotter who is craving something new. A seemingly
endless expanse of bitumen-laden sands - coupled with the powerful
scent of oil from refineries wafting through the hazy air - makes
Northern Alberta a truly one-of-a-kind destination. As families
make their vacation plans, TravellingAlberta.com offers these
adventure tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversion surfing:&lt;/b&gt; Catch a wave, Alberta-style, and join
Big Oil in taking advantage of the nearly 92 billion gallons of
water diverted from provincial rivers each year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal sightings:&lt;/b&gt; Moose playing in tailings ponds, loons
drenched in tar and ducks sinking in oil: it's not everywhere that
you can see some of Canada's most prized wildlife in these unique
settings. Hurry though! They're going fast!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tailings sailing:&lt;/b&gt; Come enjoy the vast lakes of toxic
water, so big they're visible to the naked eye from space! Chase
that horizon, but be careful not to capsize!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun in the sun:&lt;/b&gt; Forget Cancun, Alberta is sizzling!
Boasting more greenhouse gas emissions than Canada's three other
most populous provinces combined, it's really heating up out
here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will promote the website internationally, calling on
visitors to share the site with friends and to write Premier Ed
Stelmach, Travel Minister Cindy Ady and Prime Minister Stephen
Harper to demand they put the brakes on tar sand development.&lt;/p&gt;

	Twenty of our activists have successfully stopped construction of a new nuclear reactor being built in Flamanville, France, from restarting, for over 50 hours. Although building was halted because of safety problems, these are still unresolved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/6/le-24-juin-2008-des-activiste-9.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2008/6/le-24-juin-2008-des-activiste-9.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            24 June 2008, France - Greenpeace activists block the entrance of the quarries where gravel and sand are taken to the site of the EPR nuclear reactor in Flamanville. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists have been blocking three quarries that supply the
gravel and sand for the concrete needed to build the foundations of
the reactor. The peaceful direct action is in response to the
French Nuclear Safety Authority's (ASN) decision to allow
construction to resume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASN has done this despite the fact that none of the safety
problems that stopped building in the first place has been
addressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactor is a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-factsheet/"&gt;
European Pressurised Reactor&lt;/a&gt; (EPR), the flagship of the
so-called "nuclear renaissance". So far, construction of the EPR
has only started in Finland and France and both experiences have
been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="Box green"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE : 27 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; After 60 hours our activists were
removed from the last of the three quarries, by which time they had
prevented almost 400 deliveries of gravel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to continue we have moved our activities to the town
of Caen in Normandy where we are now blocking the concrete supplier
which provides all the concrete used in the construction of the
reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update : 30 June 2008&lt;/b&gt; We are continuing the blockade and
are still preventing concrete pouring at the nuclear construction
site from resuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;Chronic safety problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, the ASN ruled that construction at Flamanville must
stop. It did this because of chronic problems that have affected
the quality of the construction work since building began in
December 2007. These include issues relating to the quality
control; problems with reinforcement and concrete for the
foundations and with metal and welding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the French nuclear industry was unable to pour
concrete for the base correctly. It's a discovery that gives little
confidence that they will be able to handle masses of radioactive
material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ASN reversed its decision, so we had to take action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday the activists stopped some 3000 tonnes of gravel
(30 lorry loads going 4 times a day) from being taken from the
quarries. Some activists have been evicted, but the blockade
continues - with more people arriving from across Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace "eye in the sky" airship delivers "Non! to nuclear"
message to Finland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems at Flamanville echo those of the first EPR
construction site, &lt;a href="http://www.olkiluoto.info/en"&gt;Olkiluoto
3&lt;/a&gt;, in Finland. At the same time as the French blockade, a
Greenpeace airship is delivering a clear anti-nuclear message in
Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 43-metre long black and yellow "eye in the sky" airship
bears a banner showing a shattered radiation symbol and the words
"Non Merci!" On Tuesday it flew by the Finnish reactor site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since construction began in 2005, the estimated costs of the
reactor have nearly doubled to just short of €5 billion- and yes,
it is taxpayers who are left to foot the bill. Two and a half years
behind schedule it has been plagued with safety problems. A list
produced by Finnish regulators included 1500 "quality deviations" -
read faulty. Finnish energy industry figures show, that when, and
if, it finally comes online it will only deliver a third of the
greenhouse gas emission reductions originally promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear power undermines solutions to climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Non Merci!" message is in French because it's a direct
communication to the French government and the state-owned
companies EDF and Areva, who are not only attempting to build in
Flamanville, but are aggressively promoting the fault-ridden
reactor design across the world, claiming it to be a low-cost
"mature" technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: despite the multi-billion Euro spin of the
nuclear industry, nuclear power undermines climate protection, by
diverting urgently needed resources away from real solutions. Our
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; blueprint shows that renewable energy, and
greater energy efficiency can deliver half of the world's energy
needs by 2050, without nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments must heed the stark warnings from Olkiluoto and
Flamanville and just say "Non!" to France's dodgy nuclear
salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A pile of electronic waste on a roadside in Guiyu.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of getting the electronics
industry to face up to the problem of e-waste. We want
manufacturers to get rid of harmful chemicals in their products. We
want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child labourers
scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by society's
gizmo-loving ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 the Guide is now on its 8th
edition. It ranks the top market leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games console markets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals and take-back. It has been a key
driving force in getting many of the companies to make significant
improvements to their environmental policies. New to this edition
are &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/improved-criteria-explained/"&gt;
criteria&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of electronics companies on
tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="430" height="237"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/international/PageFiles/25153/ranking-guide-8th-edition.swf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are scored on disclosure of their greenhouse gas
emissions, commitment for absolute cuts in their own emissions and
support for the mandatory global emissions reductions that are
needed to tackle climate change. On energy efficiency, a selection
of each company's product range is assessed to see how far they
exceed the current de-facto global standard, the US Environmental
Protection Agency's &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home.index" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Star&lt;/a&gt;. Energy Star sets minimum standards
for energy efficiency for many types of &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductCategory&amp;amp;pcw_code=HEF" target="_blank"&gt;electronic products&lt;/a&gt;. The overall percentage of
renewable energy in a companies total energy use is also
assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector
currently accounts for two percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions, equal to the aviation industry. As one of the most
innovative and fastest growing industries, the biggest electronics
companies must show leadership in tackling climate change by
reducing both their direct and indirect climate change
footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our international toxics campaigner Iza Kruszewska has noticed
stark contrasts while compiling the Guide: "Electronics giants pay
attention to environmental performance on certain issues, while
ignoring others that are just as important. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Philips-8"&gt;
Philips&lt;/a&gt;, for example, scores well on chemicals and energy
criteria, but scores a zero on e-waste since it has no global
take-back polices. Philips would score higher if it took
responsibility for its own branded e-waste and established
equitable global take-back schemes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies score well on energy efficiency as their products
comply and exceed Energy Star standards. The best performers on
energy efficiency are &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Sony-Ericsson-8"&gt;
Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electrnoics-Apple-8"&gt;
Apple&lt;/a&gt;, with all of their models meeting, and many exceeding,
Energy Star requirements. Sony Ericsson stands out as the first
company to score almost top marks on all of the chemicals criteria.
With all new Sony Ericsson models being PVC-free, the company has
also met the new chemicals criterion in the ranking, having already
banned antimony, beryllium and phthalates from models launched
since January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple missed a big chance to advance its score by not improving
the environmental performance of the new version of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies that promote their 'green' policies come up short
when measured against global standards of measuring impacts on
climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Dell-8"&gt;
Dell&lt;/a&gt; scores relatively poorly while Toshiba, Samsung and LGE
score close to, or zero, on climate change criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the games console makers, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Microsoft-8"&gt;
Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; drops to second bottom of the Guide with a low score
on climate criteria. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/greener-electronics-Nintendo-8"&gt;
Nintendo's score&lt;/a&gt; increases slightly with some improvement on
toxic chemicals and climate policy. However, even Nintendo's
relatively energy efficient Wii console does not meet Energy Star
standards that cover minimum &lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers"&gt;
energy efficiency standards for PCs and consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real green leaders?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most companies now scoring less than 5/10, only a company
that rises to the challenge of phasing out toxic chemicals,
increasing the recycling rate of e-waste, using recycled materials
in new products and reducing their impact on climate change can
seriously hope to make the claim of being green.&lt;/p&gt;

	“We believe there is no place for coal in a world beset by climate change and certainly there is no place for coal in Albay”That was the statement of Governor Joey Sarte Salceda, setting the tone for our one month Quit Coal tour of the Philippines. Since the Rainbow Warrior arrived in the country we’ve taken our Quit Coal message to the places it needed to be heard, and generated real progress on the ground and in the corridors of power.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers light candles in front of Jaro Cathedral - sending a message supporting Iloilo people's demand to the Philippine government for a cleaner, safer, future powered by renewable energy. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pagbilao, we went into action to blockade shipments of coal.
The peaceful actions of our local activists and the crew of the
Rainbow Warrior helped secure commitment from leading politicians
to bring the Renewables Energy Bill to the floor of the Philippine
Senate. The bill has already been passed by the Philippine
Congress, but had been ignored by the Senate. Now we've secured the
support of influential senators, including the chair of the Senate
Committee on Natural Resources who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am one with Greenpeace in aiming for a coal-free Philippines.
The threat of climate change demands a shift towards a sustainable,
clean and low carbon future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taguig City, we painted the Quit Coal message onto the
driveway of the Department of Energy. Head of that department is
Secretary Reyes, who as chairman of the Presidential Task Force on
Climate Change should have known better than to sanction the
construction or expansion of nine coal fired power stations in a
country with huge renewable energy potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iloilo City, we constructed a climate camp to show our
support for the residents of Iloilo City who are fighting to avoid
the construction of a new coal fired power plant. At events
organised with the Catholic Church and local civil society group
RISE (Responsible Illongos for Sustainable Energy) we brought home
the message that the Philippines is one of the countries most at
risk from global warming, and that burning coal is the single
biggest source of CO2 emissions and a major cause of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we moved our camp to the site of the proposed coal fired
power station to bring our message to the local communities who
will be affected by the new power plant. Tensions ran high when
workers from Panay Power Corporation acting under orders from their
management tried to dismantle the camp and cut off the activists
from the outside world.  Our response was to take our protest to
Metrobank, one of the largest banks in the Philippines and the
owners of Panay Power Corporation. This is just the beginning of a
grassroots campaign to put pressure on the financiers behind the
coal plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour concluded with visits to Antique and Boracay. In
Antique local governor Salvacion Z Perez declared her province coal
free saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earth has provided us with renewable energy. It is time to
harness this energy to generate electricity, and it is our aim to
drastically [reduce] and ultimately stop the use of fossil fuels
especially coal as source of energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boracay, we launched our "Save the climate, Save Boracay"
project, part of an initiative to enlist top island destinations in
South East Asia to reduce their carbon footprints. The people of
Boracay face inundation from rising sea levels, but are determined
to set an example to the world with their use of renewable energy
and efficient energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior carries the Quit Coal message on to Thailand
now, but work in the Philippines continues through our South East
Asia office and allies in civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/rock-in-rio/"&gt;We're sending a message to world leaders who will be meeting at the G8 summit in Tokyo. Ask the leaders of Germany, Japan, the US, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and the UK to join YOU by becoming energy [r]evolutionaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Thirty of our activists have shut down a giant excavator in one of the largest lignite mines in the Czech Republic. We're calling on the Czech Republic to close this mine by 2012, commit to progressively decreasing their carbon emissions and to play a constructive role in the creation of effective climate policy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Lignite (brown coal) causes global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers from eight countries together with local people peacefully stopped the 50-metre high excavator and laid out a huge banner demanding an end to climate and landscape devastation. Other banners spelled out the fact that if the world does not immediately begin to phase out mines and coal-fired power plants the United Nations climate talks taking place in Poznan in December and Copenhagen next year are destined to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Czech Republic and Poland have attempted to torpedo new and ambitious European climate legislation and it is up to older EU members and particularly the current French presidency to stand firmly against the sabotage of EU climate legislation by some new member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lignite is for losers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lignite, often referred to as 'brown coal', is one of the most carbon intensive fuels. The Czech Republic has the world's second highest lignite production per capita and fourth highest CO2 emission per capita among all European states. If the mine, where our action took place, is enlarged - it is likely that Czech CO2 emissions from lignite combustion will double this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape of Northern Bohemia, once called "the Garden of the Czechs", has been turned inside-out by giant open-cast mines in the last 50 years. During the communist regime, more than 80 towns and villages were destroyed and their inhabitants forcefully resettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlargement of these mines not only endangers the climate, but would also have a detrimental impact on local people. The entire town of Horní Jiřetín - home to two thousand inhabitants and a precious baroque church - will totally dissapear. Locals, with support from Greenpeace, have successfully held on for the last four years in the face of aggressive negotiation efforts from the mining corporation - &lt;span style="font-size: 80%"&gt;ČSA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pending parliament act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their hopes now lie with the proposed Mining Act Amendment, now pending in the Czech Parliament. The proposed legislation will provide a clear legal basis for the closure of all lignite mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My country is coal-addicted and it is almost too late to heal it," said Vladimír Buřt, deputy mayor of the town of Horní Jiřetín, who participated in the protest. "Our national government promised the people of Northern Bohemia that it would start phasing out opencast mines 17 years ago. Now it is time to fulfil this promise. We strongly urge our parliament to adopt new mining legislation that will effectively protect our homes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action in the Czech Republic is just one link in a global chain. OurQuit Coal campaign - led by our flagship the Rainbow Warrior - supported by anearth shaped base station in Poland has been urging governments andenergy companies to quit coal and save the climate in Oceania, SouthEast Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean. And we're taking this message to the climate negotiatons in Poznan, Poland this December. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate Rescue Station launched against coal in Poland</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-rescue-poland121108/</url><text>
	We have set up a Climate Rescue Station on the edge of a vast open pit coal mine in Konin, Poland. The Rescue Station is a four storey tall planet earth and will be used as a platform to tell the world that we can save the climate, but only if we quit coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels. The Station will remain in Poland for five weeks in the run up to, and during, the United Nation’s Climate Change Conference taking place in Poznan between 1st - 14th of December. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the worst single climate offender
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from 15 different countries will be staying at the station to tell the story of how coal is affecting the entire planet. Coal is the single greatest threat to our climate and we are highlighting this by hosting a variety of high profile events and protests in and around the Climate Rescue Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth dome - using electricty generated from clean renewable energy - is a visual representation of the climate tipping point that the earth is currently perched on - showing the dark future ahead of us if we don't get serious and quit coal now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quit Coal - Save the Climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Climate Rescue Station is part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt; global Quit Coal campaign&lt;/a&gt; which has featured actions and events this year in Oceania, South East Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean - led by our flagship the Rainbow Warrior. She is currently on an expedition in Europe that is urging governments and energy companies such as German owned E.ON - to give coal the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland depends on coal for 93 percent of its power, yet it will play host to the international climate talks next month. Poland should set an example to the rest of the world beginning a coal phase out and switching to clean energy sources while implementing energy efficieny measures. Unless all governments make concrete plans to shift to clean energy instead of increasing their reliance on coal - we will face catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 8th, the Climate Rescue Station will be moved to Poznan Wolności square, where it will continue to send a message to delegates attending the climate talks to get serious about climate change, quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our message to delegates in Poznan will be simple - in order to save the climate - the world has to quit coal. And we can do it. Technically accessible renewable energy is capable of providing six times the energy the world currently consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get serious - start an energy [r]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/energy-r-evolutionsummary/"&gt; Energy [R]evolution report&lt;/a&gt; shows how renewable energy, combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by over 50 percent while delivering half the world's energy needs by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is widely recognised as one of mankind's greatest challenges in the 21st century. It is accelerating faster than we previously thought and much of it is caused by the continued and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. The poles are melting, coral reefs are dying and millions of people are at risk from droughts, floods, sea level rise and extreme weather events. The impacts will intensify as global temperatures continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is threatening life as we know it. There is simply no time to lose. Unless we get serious and take meaningful action now - climate change will seriously harm economies, societies and ecosystems all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments are talking of saving the climate most are allowing hundreds more coal-fired power stations to be built that will dramatically increase CO2 emissions. We can tackle climate change, but only if we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal.&lt;/p&gt;

	Mice fed on genetically-engineered maize produce fewer offspring than those fed on natural foods, according to a new study published today by the Austrian government.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/antigmoprotest.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/antigmoprotest.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace "mice" were already protesting at the risks to health and the environment from GMOs back in 2005.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian scientists performed several long-term feeding trials with laboratory mice over a course of 20 weeks. One test - the so-called "reproductive assessment by continuous breeding" showed that mouse parents fed on a diet containing 33 percent of a Monsanto owned GE maize variety (NK 603 x MON 810) experienced a decrease in litter size and weight by the time they gave birth to their third and fourth litters. Mice fed on a closely-related non-GE maize had normal reproduction cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of mice and men…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bmgfj.gv.at/cms/site/attachments/3/2/9/CH0810/CMS1226492832306/forschungsbericht_3-2008_letztfassung.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; is further evidence that the food and feed safety of GE crops cannot be guaranteed. The biotech industry is playing a game of genetic roulette with our food and with health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reproductive ramifications of this GE maize were totally unexpected - regulators around the world have previously considered this variety to be as safe as non-GE varieties: a potentially devastating error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alone should be a good enough reason to close down the whole biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protect consumers, not Monsanto's interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Austrian study should be carefully considered by food safety agencies around the world. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), for example, gave this same variety the "green light" in 2005, relying solely on Monsanto's data. The EFSA reported that it "considers it unlikely that NK603 x MON810 maize will have any adverse effect on human and animal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, EFSA gave the thumbs-up to a GE variety that this latest study highlights potential danger to human health and reproduction. Clearly EFSA's GMO panel is in urgent need of reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recall GE worldwide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarising his findings, Prof. Dr. Jurgen Zentek, Professor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Vienna - the lead author of the study - said the differences between the mice was statistically significant, and that this effect could be attributed to the differences in food sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GE maize variety in question has been approved for planting and food use in several countries, including the US, Argentina, Japan, the Philippines and South Africa. In Mexico and the EU, it has been approved for food and feed use. Considering the severity of the potential threat, Greenpeace is demanding a recall of genetically-engineered food and crops from the market, worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action...for a GMO-free Europe!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/take-action"&gt;We have a golden opportunity: EU Environment Ministers will meet to decide on December 4 whether or not to strengthen the GMO risk assessment system. In light of the Austrian study we can call on politicians to speak up, defy the GMO lobby, and vote for the environment and consumer protection.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Reports: Japanese government gives in, slashes whale quotas</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/whale-wars-quota-cut-131108/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;First ever reduction in minkes to be targetted by "research whaling" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Good news for the whales comes in threes.  And then you get a dollop of extra. Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's biggest newspapers, reports there will be a 20 percent reduction in the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hunt this year -- the first reduction since 1987.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/greenpeace-challenges-whaling.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/greenpeace-challenges-whaling.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace challenges whaling in the Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report cites lack of demand for whale meat, pressure from protests at sea and the continued opposition from Europe and Australia as reasons for the reduction in the minke whale quota from 945 minke whales to 750. The quota of 50 endangered fin whales remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news follows hard on the heels of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whaling-disarray-121108/"&gt; Greenpeace revelations&lt;/a&gt; that theindustry has been unable to crew this year's voyage with anall-Japanese crew for the first time, that the traditional ceremonyseeing the fleet off from Shimonoseki has been cancelled, and that'Yushin,' the flagship whale meat shop and restaurant in Asakusa,Tokyo, will close shop in 2010 due to ongoing financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4,200 tonnes of unsold whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reports on the closing of the Yushin restaurant, the whalers cited a lack of supply, rather than a reduction in demand, as the reason for their financial problems.  But the Institute for Cetacean Research's own figures show 4,200 tonnes of whale meat sitting surplus in storage -- an increase over last year, and Asahi's article points to a trend that our own polling confirms: fewer and fewer Japanese people are eating whale meat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those polls also confirm that very few Japanese citizens even know that their tax money is being used to prop up the whaling industry.  We're pushing that message out through our office in Japan, and believe that as the Japanese people learn more about how much whaling costs, and how corrupt the programme is, domestic pressure will become key in the government deciding to hang up the harpoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing the beginning of the end of whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary," said Sara Holden, our International Whales Campaigner "If today's reports are true we congratulate the Japanese government for making this first step, but they can and must go further and we will not stop until the quota is zero."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Years of campaigning paying off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Japan reduced its take, it was due to the moratorium on commercial whaling, which we and a handful of other environmental groups fought long and hard to win from the world's oceans to the halls of the International Whaling Commission. That single piece of work has saved thelives of tens of thousands of whales and ended the whaling programmesof the Soviet Union, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan used a loophole which allows the killing of whales for "scientific research" to continue whaling in the Southern Ocean, though at a far reduced rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has sent ships to interfere with the hunt in the Southern Ocean nine times since the Japanese government research whaling programme in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary began 20 years ago, including keeping them on the run for more than two weeks last season, saving hundreds of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winning in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition inside Japan is also growing thanks to the work of our Japanese office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year two Greenpeace activists in Japan were arrested for exposing corruption within the whaling programme.  Whaling in Japan has had little press attention, but that changed when we unveiled boxes of stolen whale meat on live television, prompting calls from Japan's media and the Tokyo public prosecutor for a full investigation of abuse of taxpayer's money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two"&gt;our own activists were arrested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political prosecution of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki has been denounced by Amnesty International and, in a periodic evaluation completed last month, the United Nations Human Rights Committee severely reprimanded the Japanese government for the "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression" in Japan. It also condemned the abuse of trespass laws by Japanese police to harass activists who are critical of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The extreme reaction by the authorities shows Greenpeace's work in Japan has put the whaling establishment under pressure" said Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "The whale meat market has clearly collapsed and is unprofitable, and the stigma of scandal and corruption has made it an unattractive and less lucrative industry to work for. The whaling industry's days are numbered, and it's time for the Japanese taxpayer to demand the government stops subsidising this bankrupt programme."&lt;/p&gt;

	As the whaling fleet prepares to depart Japan, evidence is mounting of an industry in crisis, as new revelations of financial and image problems add to the woes of the scandal-plagued industry.

            A Greenpeace inflatable boat in action against the refueling of the whaling fleet by the resupply and refrigeration vessel Oriental Bluebird.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Cetacean Research, which conducts Japan's whaling programme, and Kyodo Senpaku, which operates the whaling fleet, this week announced the closure of the whaling industry's flagship 'Yushin' whale meat shop and restaurant in Asakusa, Tokyo due to ongoing financial problems. The shop, an iconic symbol of whaling in Japan, will close its doors in 2010.  That's the same year that the Jarpa II research programme -- under which whales are killed in the guise of "scientific reserach" will be reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unable to find all-Japanese crew for "traditional" hunt?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, informants inside the whaling industry tell us that for the first time the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet will not be 100 percent Japanese-crewed, due to the resignation of many crew members following the recent &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-meat-scandal-questions180708/"&gt; whale meat embezzlement scandal&lt;/a&gt; exposed by Greenpeace in May 2008.  Our undercover investigation found that valuable cuts of whale meat were being smuggled ashore by the crew of the Japanese whaling factory ship, Nisshin Maru, for illegal trade and personal gain, at the Japanese taxpayer's expense.  One crewmember had boasted that he had built a house on the proceeds from his personal whale meat sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25101/yushin-wale-meat-shop-asakusa.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="295"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the air of scandal, it's not surprising that the whalers may also be cancelling their traditional departure party.  We received reports of the potential cancellation of the traditional high-profile ceremony in the whaling fleet's home port of Shimonoseki, which  marks the departure of the whalers for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The fleet is expected to depart later this week, from another port, where it will be seen off only by families of crew members and officials from the whaling operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We busted their refrigerator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of embarrassments follow last month's deflagging of the whaling fleet's refueling and cargo ship, Oriental Bluebird, after being ruled in violation of a number of domestic and international regulations as a result of work Greenpeace and local environmental groups took to inform Panamanian authorities of irregularities in the ship's operation.  The Oriental Bluebird had a Panamanian flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As any commercial operator knows,  when your business is universally condemned, when you can't hold onto your staff and when almost no one will buy your products  - its time to shut it down", said Sara Holden, our International Whales Campaign coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although whaling officials claim the decline in business is due to a lack of supply, the Institute for Cetacean Research's own figures flatly contradict this; the stockpile of whale meat is actually increasing, which shows  that there is no market for whale meat in Japan." According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, there were 2800 tonnes of whale meat in storage at the beginning of 2008, which has increased to 4200 tonnes by September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Orwellian: Expose a crime, get arrested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's campaign to end whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary has increasingly focused on the authorities in Japan, where 71 percent of the public do not support Japan's whaling programme. As a result of the Greenpeace investigation into embezzlement of whale meat from the factory ship Nisshin Maru, Japanese authorities mounted a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whale-meat-scandal-activists-11-07-08/"&gt; politically motivated prosecution of two Greenpeace activists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, known as the Tokyo Two, have been denied their liberty for 145 days, since exposing the corruption. They will be put on trial early next year, and face up to 10 years in jail for intercepting whale meat stolen by crew from the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International has denounced the arrest as being politically motivated, and in a periodic evaluation completed last month, the United Nations Human Rights Committee severely reprimanded the Japanese government for the "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression" in Japan. It also condemned the abuse of trespass laws by Japanese police to harass activists who are critical of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The extreme reaction by the authorities shows Greenpeace's work in Japan has put the whaling establishment under pressure" said Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "The whale meat market has clearly collapsed and is unprofitable, and the stigma of scandal and corruption has made it an unattractive and less lucrative industry to work for. The whaling industry's days are numbered, and it's time for the Japanese taxpayer to demand the government stops subsidising this bankrupt programme."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If Japan is going to start rounding up political prisoners for the crime of defending whales, they're going to have to arrest a whole heaping lot of us.  Sign the petition to stand in solidarity with Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, the Japanese government continues to send a fleet of ships to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary to kill over a thousand whales. Each season, the fleet departs for the Sanctuary and more whales needlessly die.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Who are the real criminals in the whaling industry?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we are focussing our efforts to save whales right where the Japanese government feels it the most. We're heading to Japan. On December 10th the world will celebrate the anniversary of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To coincide with this, we are creating a mass mobilisation of supporters willing to declare the arrests of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki an act of political censorship and declare themselves complicit in the crime of criticising whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lies and corruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 15th 2008, we used undercover investigators and the testimony of informers to expose large amounts of whale meat being smuggled off the Nisshin Maru to the private homes of crew members. Junichi and Toru intercepted one of the boxes, containing whale meat valued at up to US$3,000, and took it to the Tokyo public prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they are being prosecuted and are facing up to ten years in jail, for exposing an embezzlement scandal at the heart of the whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their arrest is a politically motivated attempt to quiet opposition to the whale hunt and has not gone unnoticed. Over the last few months, more than 250,000 of you have called on Japan's Prime Minister to drop the charges and release the activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the past week, the Japanese government has drawn criticism from the &lt;a title="critism from the United Nations Human Rights Committee" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/English/bodies/hrc/hrcs94.htm" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations Human Rights Committee&lt;/a&gt; for "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression and on the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting on December 10th, and leading up to Junichi and Toru's trial, we will need your help again.  Let's make sure this trial passes judgment on the real criminals in the whaling industry, and not Junichi and Toru, whose crime is speaking the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End the Hunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sailed to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in defence of the whales nine times. In 2006, a harpoon was fired over the heads of activists and the cable pulled one crew member into the freezing waters of the Antarctic. The whalers rammed our ships twice, hit one of our crew members with a metal pole and used high powered water cannons against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, they were 82 whales short of their quota. In 2007, the whaling season was cut short by a fire onboard the Nisshin Maru, and we provided emergency assistance to the whalers. In 2008 the whalers ran from the Esperanza for 14 consecutive days, saving the lives of around 100 whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are fighting to end whaling harder than ever. As a direct result of our work in Japan, whaling is under increasing scrutiny in the Japanese media. The diplomatic efforts of Australia and the US have made it a subject of increasing irritation for the Japanese department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Prime Minister. But the whale friendly nations need to make this issue more than an itch. They need to make it a pain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the whalers suffered a severe blow with the &lt;a title="Oriental Bluebird" href="/international/en/news/features/japanese-whaling-ship-outlawed281008/" target="_blank"&gt;outlawing of their supply ship, Oriental Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of our work in Panama, the state that previously flagged her. Japan needs the Oriental Bluebird to transport half their deadly catch home. Under international law, the ship should not go to the Southern Ocean, and no other nation should re-flag her.  If Japan has no supply ship, the number of whales they can take will be halved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we will not send a ship to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. We see the reaction of whaling interests as conforming perfectly to the way the most successful Greenpeace campaigns play out: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you. Then you win.'  We have not won yet, but whaling in Japan is now clearly moving toward the endgame -- and we are moving our campaign to the place where we believe that endgame will be played out -- in Tokyo. We can stop future whaling fleets before they even leave the port and we can end whaling in the Southern Ocean forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stand up for justice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Japanese government is going to unfairly prosecute the two activists for exposing the scandal and corruption of the whaling industry, they will have to face everyone that supports an end to the whale hunt.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;Join the fight to stop whaling -- in person and online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;Declare your solidarity with Junichi and Toru's efforts to save whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	More than 80 activists occupied the site of E.ON's proposed coal fired power-plant in Antwerp Harbour – setting up over four thousand tiny windmills and painting the message "Flanders Quit Coal" on the tarmac.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Less than 12 percent of the 50 billion euros E.ON plans to spend between 2008-2010 to expand its power generation will be on renewable energy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action illustrates the choice facing the Flemish
authorities. They can allow the construction of another climate
changing coal power plant or invest in wind power and greater
energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also meeting with the Cabinet of Flemish Minister
President, Kris Peeters, to debate how the region can take concrete
steps towards a future free from dirty coal and dangerous nuclear
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://greenpeace.rack66.com/images/quitcoal/slideshow.html" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" width="430" frameborder="0" height="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German electricity provider E.ON envisages the construction of a
huge coal power plant in Antwerp. The plant would emit some 6
million tonnes of CO2 per year. This is equivalent to half of what
is already coming from Belgium's six other coal power plants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just say NO!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels. A third of all
CO2 emissions come from coal and, if business continues as usual,
this could increase to 60 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.ON plans to spend 50 billion euros between 2008-2010 to expand
its power generation across Europe. But only 12 percent of this
will be invested in renewable sources of energy. E.ON plans to
build eight new coal plants in Germany, Belgium, the UK and the
Netherlands (costing around1.2 billion euros each) and to construct
another 2000MW of coal-fired capacity in the rest of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plug into the wind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action comes after the Rainbow Warrior demonstrated the
potential of a North Sea electricity grid by simulating the
connection of the first Belgian offshore wind farm to those of
neighbouring countries. The interconnection of North Sea wind farms
would increase the reliability of clean wind energy and allows it
to be combined with other renewable energy sources, like hydraulic
energy from Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ships the Arctic Sunrise and the Rainbow Warrior have been
bringing the "Quit Coal" message to the Mediterranean and Europe,
during a four month expedition, in the run-up to crucial UN climate
negotiations in Poznan, Poland, this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to kickstart an energy [r]evolution that will save the
climate - the world needs to give coal the boot NOW!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay updated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/quit_coal/"&gt;Read the Quit Coal blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to support our activists and keep our ships running.

	Yet another nail has been put in the coffin of Japan's dying whaling industry. We've managed to get the Oriental Bluebird, re-supply and transport ship of Japan’s whaling fleet, de-flagged and fined, following a legal ruling by Panamanian authorities. We are now calling on Japan to scrap the illegal vessel together with the rest of the whaling fleet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/6/whalekilled2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/6/whalekilled2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japan's "research" whaling program continues to fail on all accounts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Bluebird, used to refuel the Japanese &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/"&gt; whaling&lt;/a&gt; fleet inthe Southern Ocean and to ship whale meat back to Japan, was found to be in violation of a number of domesticand international regulations by Panamanian authorities. On October 8th it was fined themaximum penalty due to violations relating to its permissible use, the safety of human life and thepreservation of the marine environment.  In human speak, that means that the ship, which was only supposed to be refuelling the fleet (in one of the most fragile and pristine environments in the world) was not supposed to be transporting whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They should scrap the entire fleet - not just the fridge!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to chalk up this victory.  Last year, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/whaling-fleet-illegal-refueling210108/"&gt; we took action against this ship in the high seas&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the fleet from refuelling, and joined with other environmental groups in Panama to demand the vessel be de-flagged.  We asked why a ship flagged by Panama was allowed to deliver whale meat to Japan, when Panama, as a party to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, is specfically  forbidden from any such trade. Panama asked a more basic question: why was it transporting whale meat at all when it only carried permits for refuelling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25108/a-greenpeace-inflatable-boat-t-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a flag the owners of theship, Hiyo Shipping Co. Ltd in Japan, will be urgently looking for anewflag State. But it would make a mockery of international maritime lawif Japan continued to rely on the services of this vessel. They shouldscrap it and end the annual hunt in the Southern Ocean WhalingSanctuary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Or will they make a mockery of the law?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has ratified an international treaty which seeks to end the practice of 're-flagging' vessels in order to circumvent international environmental law. The treaty bars Japan from authorising a ship to participate in the exploitation of marine living resources for at least three years, if that ship has changed its flag after being found in breach of international conservation measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waste of money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Oriental Blooper' is currently docked in Shimonoseki, Japan, the home port of the whaling fleet, which is due to depart on its so-called scientific whale hunt in the next few weeks. In addition to the millions of taxpayer yen spent subsidising the whaling operation; the Japanese government has this year added an extra 800 million yen (US$8 million) for a coastguard ship to act as so-called "protection" for the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tokyo Two face ten years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two of our activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, are being prosecuted in Japan and are facing up to ten years in jail, for&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; exposing an embezzlement scanda&lt;/a&gt;l at the heart of the whaling programme. Their arrest was clearly a politically motivatedattempt to stifle opposition to the whaling programme. We're demanding that the chargesagainst them be dropped immediately -- along with the entirewhaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vast amounts of taxpayers' money is being spent to defend the indefensible and militarise a hunt of endangered whales inside an internationally designated whale sanctuary, for a programme that is neither scientifically nor economically credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time for Japanese taxpayers to wake up to the full scale of illegality and corruption in the whaling programme, and to ask why whales continue to die for nothing more than to line the pockets of a few Japanese government bureaucrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Whales are threatened by overfishing, pollution and climate change in addition to whaling. No-take marine reserves will give them the protection they so urgently need. Join the call for a global network of marine reserve including a fully protected Southern Ocean. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A series of protests this morning pressured the energy company Enel to shut down its coal-fired power plant in Genoa, Italy. Enel is keeping the plant open, despite demands by the regional government to shut it down immediately.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/enel-genoa261008.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists added their voice to the regional government's - calling on energy company Enel to shut down its coal-fired power plant in Genoa.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists entered the power plant, and climbers hung a banner
from Genoa's landmark "Torre della Lanterna" lighthouse. At the
same time, activists from our ship Arctic Sunrise painted "Quit
Coal" and "No Carbone" [No Coal] on the Ukrainian cargo ship
Aristea, as it offloaded coal at the port.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;About the coal plant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant, built in 1928, was due to shut down in 2002, but the
previous Italian government, under Silvio Berlusconi, granted it an
extension until 2020, directly undermining the regional
authorities. Enel insists it will keep the plant open until this
date. Enel is Italy's single biggest climate polluter, and is
responsible for nearly a third of all CO2 emissions coming from
Italian electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The Genoa plant is way past its retirement age. Keeping it open
directly contributes to the climate crisis and to local pollution,"
said Francesco Tedesco, Greenpeace Italy climate and energy
campaigner, from the scene. "The regional government has made it
clear that it wants Enel to close the plant down, and Greenpeace is
here today to make sure Enel listens."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Liguria regional government's energy plan is one of the few
in Italy to be &lt;a href="http://www.ambienteinliguria.it/eco3/DTS_GENERALE/20071002/pianoenergetico.pdf" title="The Liguria regional government plans to increase renewables capacity to 7% by 2012."&gt;
applauded&lt;/a&gt;. Greenpeace is encouraging it to push through its
renewable energy plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It is scandalous that Enel ignores the requests of the Liguria
authorities," said Agnes de Rooij, Greenpeace International climate
and energy campaigner onboard the Arctic Sunrise. "There is no
excuse for keeping this massively polluting coal-fired power plant
open, especially when clean, safe wind and solar power are able to
produce the &lt;a href="http://www.anev.org/modules/Documents/eodocuments/Potenziale_Eolico.pdf"&gt;
same amount of electricity&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Ciao Italy, Quit Coal tour continues
with the Rainbow Warrior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew of the Arctic Sunrise and Greenpeace Italy activists
have had a busy and successful ten days in Italy, challenging the
coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They kicked it off by occupying a crane at a coal plant
construction site near Rome, on October 16th.  Other activists
painted, "No Carbone" on the power plant's dock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Italian government was trying block important
climate change agreements being discussed by the European Union. 
We helped turn up the heat on them in Brussels and back home. 
After two days of talks, the Italian government lost. EU leaders
confirmed their commitment to finalise the climate and energy
package before international climate negotiations take place in
December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, activists blockaded an E.ON coal plant in Sardinia -
stopping the two conveyor belts delivering coal into the furnace.
We met with the regional environmental minister - while climbers
maintained a 14-hour occupation of the conveyor belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to the minister about how Sardinia should be investing
in renewable energy instead of pushing more coal.  He agreed and
promised the regional government would revise its energy plans to
meet EU climate protection targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this victory, we decided to show some support for a
regional government that was already trying to do the right thing.
Hopefully, today's action will get Enel to listen, and shut down
its coal plant near Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The Quit Coal expedition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is running short. Quitting coal is essential to a
meaningful deal to save the climate. European governments need to
show leadership by phasing-out coal in their own countries. Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;Energy
[R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; shows how renewable energy, combined with greater
energy efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by 50 percent and
deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's protests are part of a four-month tour by our ships
Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise. Bringing the "Quit Coal"
message to the Mediterranean and Europe. Our Quit Coal expedition
is happening in the run-up to crucial UN climate negotiations in
Poznan, Poland, this December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/getinvolved/"&gt;Things you can do to create an Energy Revolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The statement below was signed by the
heads of six international NGOs: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span name="spanarticlecontent" id="spanArticleContent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gerd Leipold, International Executive       Director, Greenpeace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Irene Khan, Secretary General, Amnesty
International &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremy Hobbs, Executive Director, Oxfam
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Dean Hirsch, Chief Executive Officer, World Vision
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tom Miller, Chief Executive Officer, PLAN
International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span name="spanarticlecontent" id="spanArticleContent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Robert Glasser, Secretary General, CARE       International&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Last week the USgovernment provided another
bail-out of $37.8 billion to the giant insurancecompany, AIG,
bringing the total of rescue loans to that one company in thelast
two weeks to nearly $123 billion. This is $18 billion &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;
than the annual amount of aid to poor countries and twice
thatneeded to achieve the internationally-agreed Millennium
Development Goals. In Europe the bail-outs have continued. The UK
government has thrown in a further 50billion to recapitalise the
UKbanking sector - which is roughly what's needed for poor
countries to adapt toclimate change each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urgency shown by rich countries to tackle the financial
meltdown standsin stark contrast to their foot-dragging and broken
promises over aid andpoverty alleviation, human rights and climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is too soon yet to predict exactly how badly the poorest
countries willfare in the financial crisis and resultant economic
downturn. But it is clearthat reduced demands for exports to
developed countries and lower foreigninvestment will mean less
growth and government revenue for already-fragilesocial protection
and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millions of the world's poorest citizens, it is literally a
matterof life and death. In many countries social safety nets were
dismantled underpressure from international financial institutions,
leaving the vulnerableunprotected. In late September, while Wall
Street was reeling from its financialfailures in the glare of
publicity, a meeting organized by the United Nations inanother part
of Manhattan revealed that very few governments will meet
thetargets set by the Millenium Development Goals to reduce poverty
by 2015, andthat rising food and energy prices have wiped away much
of the progress made sofar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human rights prognosis is not good. Not only are economic
and socialrights - including the right to housing, health and
education - coming underincreased pressure, there is a risk of more
human rights violations. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As the economy shrinks and countries
tightentheir belts, migrants and refugees could be pushed back to
untenablesituations. Social tensions could increase, leading
nervous governments toclamp down on dissent and impose tough public
security policies, curbing civilliberties. Already fragile states
could be further weakened by the currentcrisis and slide back into
instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse could follow if rich countries decide to use the financial
crisis asan excuse to cut aid and trade. History gives us cause for
concern. During the1972/3 recession, global aid spending fell by
15% to just $28.8 billion. In1990/3, aid donors slashed their
spending by 25% over a five-year period to $46billion, and aid did
not return to 1992 levels until 2003. Humanitarian aid -what we
spend to help people hit by natural disasters and conflict - also
fell sharplyand over a similar time as a direct result of the
1990-3 recession (only theyears of the Rwandaand Kosovo conflicts
bucked that trend). In terms of trade, for instance,
countriesreacted to the 1929 Wall Streetcrash and global depression
by erecting tariff barriers and world trade fell bytwo-thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A replay ofthat in 2009 would be a disaster for poor exporting
countries.Reduced aid and trade flows could mean that the people in
the poorestcountries pay the highest price for the profligacy of
the credit bubble inNorth America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human rights are not a luxury for good times. Inaction in the
face of climatechange is not a viable option. Global poverty does
nothing for globalstability. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rich countries will befollowing a myopic and
self-defeating strategy if they ignore the most pressingchallenges
of our times and focus solely on narrow financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just about money. It is about sustainedattention,
international collaboration and clear political will to tackle
bigissues. The signs of concerted action by the G7 finance
ministers and the Eurozonefinance ministers to address the
financial crisis are welcome but they are notenough.
Governmentsmust reduce the volatility in energy prices, food prices
and the financialmarkets by ensuring sensible regulation, adequate
protection for the rights of poorand vulnerable people, and
long-term environmental sustainability. Governmentsmust show
decisive leadership to build a global economy that is green and
wherebetter lives and livelihoods for all is more important than a
system thatrewards a privileged few.&lt;/p&gt;

	Here's some good news in the fight to protect the second largest rainforest on Earth, as Olam - a major trading company - finds its World Bank funding cut, after we revealed their involvement in illegal logging in the Congo Basin Forest.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest on the banks of the Congo river system, Equatorial province, Democratic Republic of Congo.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of weeks ago, we wrote to the World Bank's private lending arm, the International Finance Corporation, highlighting its investment in Olam International, a Singapore-based global commodities trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pointed out that Olam was trading in illegally logged timber in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the International Finance Corporation has decided to sell its stake in Olam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olam's involvement in illegal timber trade was first detailed in our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/carving-up-the-congo-exec/"&gt; Carving up the Congo report&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year. The report illustrated how Olam was holding forest land in the Congo &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/when-is-a-moratorium-not-a-moratorium"&gt; granted in breach of a moratorium on the granting of new logging titles&lt;/a&gt;, which the World Bank itself had helped to establish. The report also described how Olam was sourcing timber from destructive and illegal operations through de-facto subcontracting agreements with third-party suppliers involved in illegal logging. While Olam has subsequently returned logging titles obtained in breach of the moratorium, it continues to trade in destructive and illegal timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congo Basin Forest constitutes the second largest rainforest on Earth, storing important amounts of carbon and providing livelihoods for tens of millions of people. The story of logging in the Congo forests, however, is a story of corruption, environmental havoc and social injustice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is completely out of control. Meaningful law enforcement and government control are non-existent. Social conflict is omnipresent in logging concessions where the needs of local communities clash with the rush for profit by international companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move by the International Finance Corporation should send a strong signal to all those investors and companies involved in the destruction of the Congo rainforests. It should also serve as a warning to donors, such as the German and the French governments, who are currently considering financial support for large logging companies in the DRC. The World Bank must address the serious shortcomings in its programmes in the DRC - which have been identified by its own Inspection Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As delegates in Bali negotiate the future of our global climate and our forests - the protection of which is a key solution to climate change - rainforest destruction in Africa continues unabated - but the International Finance Corporation's action points towards a window of opportunity in the DRC. The international community needs to help the country develop alternatives that benefit communities and reduce poverty, and it needs to do this now!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Gore goes full bore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a packed side event at the Bali climate conference,
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore, urged delegates to raise their
level of ambition, saying that, "The maximum now considered
possible is the minimum and falls far short of what we need."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tore into the United States for the blocking role the Bush
Administration is playing in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore reminded delegates, jaded by nearly two weeks of wrangling
with text, that change will come. And in a reference to how the
recent Australian election had overturned that government's stance
on the current Kyoto Protocol and with an eye to next year's US
Presidential election he said, "Over the next two years, the United
States is going to be somewhere it isn't right now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bali is now. Gore urged delegates to negotiate around the US
- the "elephant in the room" as he called it - and reminded his
audience that they have in their hands "the destiny of all
generations to come."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech laden with quotable quotes, his final reference was
to the ingredient that has so far been lacking in Bali, namely
political will. Gore says political will is a "renewable resource".
That's right: if you don't use it, you lose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Europe finally showing some grit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours before Gore spoke, France's Environment Minister
Jean-Louis Borloo threatened to withdraw from hosting a meeting of
the Major Emitters - a process for 'doing whatever takes your
fancy' on climate - which the US has set up to try and supplant
Kyoto. In a heated meeting with Paula Dobriansky, head of the US
delegation, Borloo said they could all forget a trip to Paris
unless the US came to the table with a Kyoto-style proposal with
binding commitments to cut global warming pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal, which currently occupies the revolving Presidency of
the European Union, rammed home the same message during a press
conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;‘Advance Australia Fair’? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is ratifying Kyoto. So why is it still one of the Bali
bad guys opposing real action to cut emissions? An opinion poll we
commissioned shows overwhelming support among Australians for Kevin
Rudd, the new Aussie premier, to go further in the next three years
by cutting the country's greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out
electricity generation from coal-fired power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by Newspoll, found that 86 percent of
Australians want Rudd to put in place new policies to cut
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rudd, it looks like you have a mandate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2007 is seventh warmest year &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data also released today by the UK's Hadley Centre and the
University of East Anglia shows that 2007 confirms the warming
trend, confirming the need for swift action. Globally, 2007 has
been the seventh warmest year since 1850, despite the moderating
effect of 2007's La Nina event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre's head of climate prediction said the data confirms
"the need for swift action to combat further rises in global
temperatures."&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s ensure Kyoto continues to grow healthy and strong!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kyoto-10th-birthday-121207/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;10 years old, and still Kyoto is the most far-reaching environmental treaty ever agreed - so let’s give it three cheers and wish it many happy returns!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Slightly embarrassed, Japan’s Environment Minister Ichiro Kamashito cut a giant 1.5 metre-high cake which the Solar Generation, Greenpeace’s youth group, arranged to celebrate the 10th birthday of the Kyoto Protocol, in Bali, on 11 December.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Japan's Environment Minister, Ichiro Kamoshita, cuts the cake celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol, presented at the international meeting on climate change in Bali by the Solar Generation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For the metrically-challenged, like some of us here at
Greenpeace, that's very nearly 5 feet of gateau!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No scantily-clad activist emerged from inside the cake...the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;embarrassment was due to Kyoto's host country, Japan - assisted
by Australia and Canada - doing its best during the current UN
climate negotiations to prevent its offspring Protocol from growing
up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-tier cake, decorated with forests, orangutans and
symbols of renewable energy, including wind turbines and solar
panels, carried the words 'Happy 10th Birthday Kyoto'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyoto has defied attempts by the US Administration to kill it.
Better yet, the agreement is working. That's according to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - which picked up its
Nobel Peace Prize this week, in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC's report earlier this year was clear: "The Kyoto
Protocol's most notable achievements are the stimulation of an
array of national policies, the creation of a carbon market and the
establishment of new institutional mechanisms."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Kyoto needs to be fed the healthy diet of a strong Bali
mandate for governments to commit to deep and legally-binding cuts
in greenhouse gas emissions when the Protocol is in its mid
teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's holding Kyoto back, according to the IPCC, is its "modest
emissions limits." The pre-eminent scientific body on climate
change wrote, "It would be more effective if the first commitment
period is followed-up by measures to achieve deeper reductions and
the implementation of policy instruments covering a higher share of
global emissions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not agree more. Kyoto is the most far-reaching
environmental treaty ever agreed, with almost every country in the
world committing to some form of action in the fight against
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's give three cheers to Kyoto and wish it many happy
returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one birthday cake on which the candles must be kept
burning!&lt;/p&gt;

	As negotiators from 190 governments complete the first of two weeks of discussions on climate change, in Bali, people around the world will be took to the streets for a Global Day of Action, to raise their voices about the need for urgent action to avert dangerous climate change.

            A flotilla of fishing boats greet the Greenpeace SV Rainbow Warrior flagship as she sails into Bali Indonesia today 7 December 2007. The flotilla is calling on people all over the world to take part in tomorrow's global day of action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 19 countries joined or led a variety of
protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that
Ministers who arrive in Bali, Indonesia for the final week of
negotiations agree on a strong plan to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'"There is only one week to go to agree on a mandate to
negotiate a stronger Kyoto Protocol, with deep emissions reductions
for developed countries, plus an agreement to tackle
deforestation," said Gavin Edwards, head of the climate campaign,
from Bali. "A loud and clear message from capital cities around the
world will be pivotal in keeping the pressure up on governments to
not leave Bali empty-handed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia, Thailand joined the Global Day of
Climate Action by releasing the new edition of "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-thailand/news/global-climate-action-save-climate-handbook"&gt;
Save the Climate Handbook&lt;/a&gt;" with a forward from Dr. Sumet
Tantivechakul, Thailand's renowned scientist about how sustainable
economy can reduce global warming at Chatuchak weekend market, one
of the world's biggest weekend markets. The activity also had a
solar bar and Climate Clinic demonstrating the use of solar energy
and where people could calculate their carbon dioxide emissions.
There was also a music performance by Ionian band. Moreover, people
could write their messages to be delivered to the UN Climate Change
Conference in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Be The Change coalition, we held a 'Climate
Rescue Carnival'.  there was food, drinks, music, info,
face-painting, and a biodiesel powered bouncy-castle for the kids.
Over 500 people formed a human banner spelling out 'Climate SOS'.

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of students, bikers, runners, volunteers, and

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace activists ended their occupation of a
thermal coal power plant. One of the climbers said, "This plant is
a symbol of how coal not only threatens the world's climate but
devastates the land and people's lives." (&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2007/12/video_activists_occupy_czech_c.html"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overa thousand Greenpeace India volunteers used placards to
spell outmessages in the stands at the first day of the
India-Pakistan cricketmatch (watched by millions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They made their messages matchevents on the field. For example,
every time a batsman hit a four, theyshowed a message saying,
'climate change knows no boundaries.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ivolunteered for this activity with Greenpeace because it's my
world tosave. I don't need to be a super hero and teaming up with
others I willdo what I can to collectively make a difference." said
Shams, a studentfrom 2nd year PU St. Joseph's College who held a
letter placard withthe message 'Climate Change is World
Emergency'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace together with Finnish League for Nature Conservation
skied across the centre of Helsinki, calling for and end to
emissions to bring back the snow for the skiers. The fair lady of
Finland was hanging far behind the rest of the skiers, referring to
Finland being left behind in international climate commitments. The
happening was a part of international climate action day on 8th
December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the centre of Luxembourg City, our activists
installed a 9 x 6 meter flag "Change" (the logo of Greenpeace
Luxembourg's green power campaign) above the flag of the "blue
deer". The "blue deer" is the symbol of Luxembourg, the European
capital of culture 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the culture year ends today, the age of energy revolution
starts. The Greenpeace flag will remain on top of the flagpole
until Sunday, so thousands of people coming to Luxembourg City to
celebrate the closing party activities of the culture year will see
our message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace Russia activists hang a banner over the
Moskva River with the Kremlin as a backdrop. Russia ranks third in
the world in terms of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mexico, Mexico City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Mexico participated with a trajinera, a typical
Mexican boat, going to Kyoto Plus and asking for the climate to be
saved.  The message of the banner says: 2° = GLOBAL DANGER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HK power plant, announced its own climate change policy on Dec
7. So we did an action before their announcement. We suspended a
banner writing "Climate Change Starts Here" at the 30-m tall ash
silos outside the plant. The aim is to push the Hong Kong
government to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants and shoulder
the responsibility of combating climate change as an international
city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a thousand people joined the demonstration. Bad weather but
good spirits. Some people were dressed up as animals: a polar bear
and a homeless orangutan sitting at a bus stop. We had a rickshaw
where people could hop in, go online and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-sweden/palmolja-otankbart/namninsamling"&gt;
create their own monkey&lt;/a&gt; to our virtual monkey mountain  - in
order to help get rid the Swedish subsidies for palm oil as a
biofuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People had to brave heavy rain and railway strikes but despite
this around 4000 people turned up for to call for ambitious targets
to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands protested across the country, including at one of
Europe's largest coal plants (near Düsseldorf).  Millions of people
also turned their lights off for five minutes at 8:00 pm - saving
roughly 1,000 megawatts of electricity, which means about 25
million lightbulbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/send-a-message-to-bali?MM_URL=gda-climate-07"&gt;Send a message - Tell world leaders "Climate Action Now!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus?MM_URL=gda-climate-07"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.
