	700 volunteers posed nude in a French vineyard to send a message about climate change. This human art installation in the South of Burgundy was created by artist Spencer Tunick - to warn about the dangers of global warming.

            Naked message: global warming could mean an end to the days of wine... and rosés.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Parental warning: the story below contains nudity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The emerging power of Japan’s ‘Hydrangea’ revolution</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2012/The-emerging-power-of-Japans-Hydrangea-revolution/</url><text>
	Like the flower it has been named after, a budding civil movement is emerging and taking root in Japan to protest against the government’s decision to restart the Ohi nuclear plant.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The restart, just 18 months after the devastating tsunami and resulting nuclear Fukushima nuclear disaster last year, has sparked indignation and alarm in a Japanese society left scarred by the catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a nation not especially known for public protests or civil disobedience, the rolling demonstrations in Japan this week and last suggest a major shift in Japanese society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/international/Global/international/photos/nuclear/2012/Japan-Nuclear.jpg" alt="Junichi Sato" width="300" height="200"&gt;This movement against nuclear energy has been named after the Hydrangea, a flower the Japanese have traditionally loved because it blooms in June and July, giving hope during the dark, rainy season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The symbolism of the flower is strikingly synonymous with the growing civil movement against nuclear power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born out of the aftermath of arguably one of Japan’s darkest hours, the movement offers hope and is gathering in numbers – similar to how the Hydrangea forms its flower; each small flower bunches together to form a bigger, more vibrant, flower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, stood with trembling excitement among tens of thousands of people shouting “Saikado Hantai” (No Restart of Nuclear Plant) in front of the gate of the prime minister’s office in Tokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protestors had emerged to object to a decision from Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to restart the first nuclear reactor following the 3/11 disaster.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heading up the stairs from the subway station towards the demonstration, I could already feel the powerful energy of the protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even mothers with small children, the future of Japan, were holding handmade banners saying “NO NUKES”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Held on a Friday night, city workers in suits left their offices to join the protest after work. They too were holding placards in a protest that is truly made up of diverse parts of Japanese society.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The last time I saw a crowd of people that came close to this was a march in 2003, when the Japanese people voiced their opposition to war in Iraq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, however, the atmosphere of the protest was different. It was not organised by an organisation and was absent of flags and banners brandishing a single group’s name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, people simply came to protest because they wanted to be there and directly communicate their concerns to the prime minister. That is why I felt the power of the message: it came from individuals. It was extraordinarily energizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing civil society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2008, I was arrested and later sentenced to a suspended prison term because I had stood up for the public good; exposing scandals in the subsidised Japanese whaling industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been an extremely hard fight to have the ideal of ‘freedom of expression’ recognised in conservative Japanese society. Generally, people have believed that the government and big corporations are always right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A parliamentary report released this week blamed lax safety measures at the country’s nuclear plants due to what it called the country’s powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is now starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 3/11 disaster has changed people’s understanding and undermined their trust in the government and big corporations. Citizens have become more critical of government information and are more open to protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday, the protest spilled over from pedestrian paths onto the six-lane road in front of the prime minister’s house. Effectively, they marched on the street and occupied it. A follow-up protest will soon be held at the same location. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the first nuclear reactor was restarted this week, I am sure that politicians are feeling the power of ‘Revolution Hydrangea 紫陽花革命’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join us, support the citizens of Japan and be part of the Hydrangea Revolution.&lt;br&gt;Create a twitter storm to tell the Japanese Prime Minister Noda ‘#紫陽花革命’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply copy the Japanese characters (Saikado Hantai) below to tweet @kantei, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;再稼働反対 Japanese Prime Minister Noda, #DontRestartNukes. @kantei  #紫陽花革命&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together we can take hold of a nuclear-free future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saikado Hantai 再稼働反対!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junichi Sato is Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>New leadership at Greenpeace International</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/new-leadership-at-greenpeace-110609/</url><text>
	Greenpeace will soon have a new leader. Kumi Naidoo will take up the role of Executive Director of Greenpeace International in November 2009, when Gerd Leipold steps down after nearly nine years as our activist-in-chief. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/kumi-naidoo.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/kumi-naidoo.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi was part of the successful struggle against apartheid in his native South Africa. He is an activist and a Rhodes Scholar.  For ten years he was the General Secretary of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation. Today he sits on the board of Greenpeace Africa and chairs the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the founders of &lt;a href="http://www.whiteband.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Call to Action Against Poverty&lt;/a&gt;, which has grown since 2005 into a coalition of anti-poverty campaigners from over 100 countries. They apply public pressure on leaders to fulfil promises on aid, trade, debt, climate change and gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi brings with him a passion for activism, for non-violence and clear ideas for shaping the future of Greenpeace. His experiences in campaigning, fundraising, advocacy, policy work, networked organisations and leading through change will all be called upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The way Greenpeace works on all levels from confrontation to cooperation with governments and corporations is an inspiration. The mix of pragmatism and passion really gets things done and effects real change in the world. I believe that Greenpeace is one of the most precious assets the global community posses as a critical part in reversing the current fatal trajectory of our planet," says Kumi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"History teaches us that real change only comes when good men and womenare prepared to put their lives and personal safety on the line toadvance the cause of justice, equity and peace. I believe today thatGreenpeace is the leading organization in embracing that approach."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Chair of the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA), of which Greenpeace is a member, for the coming months he will focus his attention on generating civil society pressure and cooperation to demand a strong deal at the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen this December:  one which gets CO2 emissions under control, protects tropical rainforests, and replaces dirty fossil fuel energy with renewables and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/management/executive-director/"&gt; Gerd Leipold&lt;/a&gt; will remain at the helm until November, and has this to say about the successor he has already worked closely with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kumi has all of the qualities needed to take Greenpeace forward and lead it in the greatest challenge it and the world has ever faced: climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/"&gt; Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt; (Stichting Greenpeace Council), is the body that coordinates global Greenpeace policy and strategy, and is based in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt; The best way to welcome Kumi? Take action, of course! Demand world leaders personally attend the Copenhagen summit&lt;/a&gt;, and take personal responsibility for sealing the right deal to save our planet from runaway climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bon Voyage</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bon-voyage-mercury-waste/</url><text>
	A container ship currently heading from southern India to the US represents a small victory in the fight against corporate crime across the globe. The ship is carrying 320 tonnes of toxic mercury contaminated waste which comes from a closed plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of consumer products giant Unilever.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/unilever-agrees-to-clean-up-it.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/12/unilever-agrees-to-clean-up-it.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unilever agrees to clean up its toxic mercury mess in south India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unilever mercury thermometer production plant was set up in TamilNadu, India in 1983 after being shipped wholesale from it previous location in New York State in the US. It is a classic tactic of the chemical industry to ship plants that are too dirty or inefficient for the US or Europe to areas such as India and extend their life where environmental and safety standards are lower. Hence the industry can continue to make profits from pollution for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Moving the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant at Kodaikanal imported mercury from the US and re-exported the thermometers back to the US. Mercury is a potent toxin affecting the nervous system of people and animals and a highly dangerous pollutant. Lax safety standards at the plant left workers with mercury poisoning and large amounts of mercury contaminated waste were dumped in the surrounding areas in complete disregard for the local communities by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local environmental groups and Greenpeace first exposed the mercury dumping scandal in May 2001. Subsequent protests by locals forced the closure of the plant but the contaminated waste was left littering the site and surrounding area. Investigations by the pollution control authorities revealed the pollution to be far worse than the company had admitted with soil contamination 600-800 the legal levels and approximately 17 times more mercury was unaccounted for than the company estimates. The authorities ordered the company to clean up the site and safely treat the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananthapadmanabhan, one of our campaigners in India, is studying the clean up: "We will be keeping a close watch on all future remedial actions by the company. Several thousand tonnes of toxic wastes and contaminated soil are still to be properly identified and contained. Now that the clean up has begun in earnest, compensation and health care for affected ex-workers should be immediately brought on to the agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste will be treated at a special plant in the US. The start of the clean up is a big victory for campaigners in India where other polluted hotspots cause by irresponsible companies, like Bhopal, abound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><author_name></author_name><taxonomy><value>climate change</value><value>toxics</value><value>about us</value><value>solutions</value><value>toxic trade</value><value>mercury</value><value>toxics</value><value>pollution</value><value>hazardous wastes</value><value>heavy metals</value><value>greenpeace</value></taxonomy><date>2003-05-23 00:00:00</date></item>
<item><language>en</language><title>World's largest tuna destroyer - caught!</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/albatuna-tres-062708/</url><text>
	We chased it for 5 days, but as dawn broke over the Pacific this morning we finally confronted the biggest tuna fishing vessel in the world. The Spanish-owned and flagged tuna purse seiner "Albatun Tres" is known as a 'super, super seiner' and can net 3,000 tonnes of tuna in a single fishing trip. This is almost double the entire annual catch of some Pacific island countries.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/the-most-devastatingly-efficie.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/the-most-devastatingly-efficie.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The most devastatingly efficient tuna fishing vessel in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught this monstrous tuna catcher deploying its net close to the Phoenix Islands of Kiribati and witnessed many tonnes of tuna being taken out of the Pacific. We laid a 25-metre floating banner reading "No Fish, No Future"' across the inside of the net as it was being hauled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first found the Albatun Tres on May 22nd and tracked her across more than 1,000 nautical miles. Her crew must have noticed us when we came within visual range as they immediately steamed away at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to catch up with them when they stopped to fish, and as they pulled in their catch we showed up in inflatable boats, a jet ski and helicopter in order to expose their plunderous activities to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BA7enHKa5As?rel=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purse seine vessels surround schools of fish with curtain-like nets to catch tuna. A rope along the bottom of the net is pulled like a drawstring and the whole catch is hauled onboard. These vessels have increased their efficiency enormously in the last decade through a variety of technological innovations. While targeting skipjack tuna, these vessels also catch juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, as we witnessed this morning. This bycatch is seriously threatening the already vulnerable stocks of bigeye and yellowfin tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign fishing nations including those of the European Union (EU) are fishing unsustainably where Pacific island countries depend on tuna for income and food. The Albatun Tres arrived in the Pacific from the Indian Ocean earlier this year. It is owned by the Spanish tuna company Albacora, which is part of OPAGAC, a powerful association of Spanish tuna boat owners, processors and traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No more fish at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery, the world's biggest, has been subjected to intense fishing by fleets from Asia and the United States since the 1960s. With declining tuna stocks in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the European Union has gained access to this Pacific fishing ground as a reciprocal benefit for giving aid to Pacific countries. With their own waters fished out, the EU and other foreign fishing fleets including Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the US, are literally sailing across the world to take vital fish and income from people whose lives depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe align="middle" frameborder="0" height="430" scrolling="no" src="http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?user_id=16093524@N00&amp;amp;set_id=72157605296853768" width="430"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super seiners of OPAGAC have a questionable history in the region and some of the vessels which they currently represent were pirate fishing in the area last year. Just when the Pacific fishing fleets need to be reduced we have found evidence to show that OPAGAC is trying to expand their fishing capacity here. This group of companies has no shame and targets the poorest and most vulnerable countries in order to gain access to Pacific waters. Greenpeace is urging Pacific island countries to cease any future dealings with OPAGAC. Vessels of this size need to be taken off the water and scrapped immediately in order to address the overcapacity of the world's tuna fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship Esperanza has been in the region for the last eight weeks highlighting the overfishing of tuna. During this time we have taken action against fishing fleets from Taiwan, Korea, the US, the Philippines and now Spain.  At the same time, our ship Arctic Sunrise has been taking action against overfishing of tuna &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/"&gt; in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;Dead oceans? Dead planet. Help us preserve one of the planet's life support systems by setting aside 40 percent of the world's oceans as marine reserves. Our seas need time to recover.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;Help keep our ships at sea and our activists in action. We don't accept money from governments or corporations, but rely on millions of people all over the world like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Global fashion brands are turning us into unwitting polluters. This is what we discovered in our latest research conducted on clothing and sportswear produced by big companies such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Ralph Lauren and G-Star.

&lt;p&gt;We tested products that we &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt;knew contained residues of toxic substances&lt;/a&gt; by washing them under conditions that simulated domestic laundering. Then we measured how much of the chemicals remained in the clothing. In this way we could identify the percentage of "washed out" chemicals which end up being flushed into our rivers, lakes and seas, where they break down to form even more hazardous substances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are these substances?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These chemicals have some nasty properties. For example, NPEs breaks down into nonylphenols, chemicals which are persistent, bio-accumulative and hormone-disrupting. This means that they do not break down easily into the environment, build up in the food chain, and can seriously mess with some organisms' hormone systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigative work: Dirty Laundry part one, two and three.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year we published &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/" target="_blank"&gt;our investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealing how the suppliers of major clothing brands were discharging hazardous chemicals in their waste water directly into Chinese rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We challenged the brands found to be in business with these suppliers to take responsibility for this pollution, and to use their considerable influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate these toxic discharges throughout their supply chain and products.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="text"&gt;
    &lt;p class="description"&gt;As much as 70 percent of China's rivers, lakes and reservoirs are affected by water pollution. During our recent investigations, Greenpeace identified links between a number of major clothing brands and textile factories in China that are releasing hazardous chemicals into our rivers. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p class="copyright"&gt;© Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/detox/Detox-Timeline/" target="_blank"&gt;Some brands accepted&lt;/a&gt; the challenge and have begun working on a detailed plan to reach the goal by 2020. Others insisted that these chemicals were not used in their manufacturing their products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We tested the products of a number of the brands linked to these suppliers and found residues of hazardous chemicals in their clothing proving that these hazardous substances had been used in the manufacturing of their products. The results of this investigation were published in the report&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/" target="_blank"&gt; 'Dirty Laundry - Hung out to dry'&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The residues we found might seem small in quantity if considered compared to the single piece of clothing. But there is no safe amount of toxic chemicals, and given the huge volume of garments produced by these global brands, the total quantities of these chemicals entering our water is far from insignificant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our latest investigation tested clothing we had found containing these hazardous substances to find out what happens during normal washing conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results implicate anyone who buys these brands and washes their clothes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/photos/toxics/2012/GP03T7K.jpg" alt="NPE Maps" width="487" height="536"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textile industry is creating water pollution &lt;strong&gt;all around the globe&lt;/strong&gt;, including those regions and countries where there are restrictions or bans on the use of these chemicals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero discharge of hazardous chemicals within a generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire textile sector needs to move to toxic-free processes. To reach this goal we need more brands joining the detox challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the companies which have already committed to the elimination of the use of these substances, the next step is for them to respond to the urgency of the situation by setting strict and ambitious elimination deadlines for the most hazardous chemicals used by this sector, including nonylphenol ethoxylates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know these chemicals are dangerous, and viable alternatives exist so these big brand names need to turn their words into actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of you already joined together to put pressure on these brands to "Detox", and thanks to your efforts, Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&amp;amp;M, Li-Ning and C&amp;amp;A have all committed to eliminate the use of all hazardous chemicals from their supply chain and products by 2020 .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;You can take action today by:&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing this story with your friends and family to help raise awareness of the issue&lt;br&gt;-    Sharing the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/People-Power/" target="_blank"&gt;latest campaign video &lt;/a&gt;which shows the role of #PeoplePower in shaking up the fashion sector &lt;br&gt;-    &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/what-you-can-do/star-in-our-next-video/" target="_blank"&gt;Submitting your photo &lt;/a&gt;to help star in the next #PeoplePowered campaign video while pushing your favorite brand to be the next to Detox&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to a recent spate of industrial palm oil projects in Cameroon, Greenpeace Africa is working with a Cameroonian NGO to show how small-scale farming projects are a better development option -- for communities on the ground and Cameroon's rainforests. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The rich forests of South West Cameroon support thousands of communities, by providing food, building materials and medicine. Greenpeace Africa is working with Cameroonian NGO ACDIC (Association Citoyenne pour la Defense des Interêts Collectifs) to assess how small-scale farming can offer a responsible development path, in contrast to a proposed industrial palm oil plantation in the region, which threatens local livelihoods and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="photo"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/international/Global/africa/graphics/CameroonPhotoEssay/set1.jpg" alt="Cameroon Rainforest" width="720" height="274"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;The rainforest is home to many communities and is also a biodiversity hotspot of global importance. African Forest Elephants, whose numbers have collapsed due to habitat loss, still roam here, and endangered chimpanzees chatter in the canopy above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, representatives of local communities came together at a workshop held by Greenpeace Africa and ACDIC in the town of Kumba on April 16, to share ideas on &lt;a href="/international/Global/africa/publications/forests/Agriculture_FoodSecurity_EN.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;how to ensure food security and forest protection&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 90 people attended, and identified technical support for farmers, access to land, and producing food locally for local consumption as some of the key factors in achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Communities affected by the Herakles project are mobilising themselves and investigating sustainable alternatives to industrial palm oil projects. Greenpeace has been working with local partners on the ground to support these efforts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a positive and viable alternative to the 73,000 hectare palm oil project proposed by US-based corporation Herakles Farms, which would jeopardize the livelihoods of more than 14,000 people who currently live and farm in the concession area. Fearful of losing their lands and livelihoods, some local people have protested against the project, and have faced intimidation and arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for the palm oil industry and investors to implement a transparent ‘Zero Deforestation Policy’, which respects the rights and livelihoods of local communities and ensures the protection of natural forest.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict. Reaching the most affected populations with the aid continuesto be a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McVictory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Victory as fast food giant pledges to help protect the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mister Splashy Pants the whale - you named him, now save him</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/splashy-101207/</url><text>
	Out of 11,000 submissions in our competition to name the humpback whales we were tracking on their migration to the Southern Ocean, we narrowed it down to the final 30. Over 150,000 people then voted for their favourite name. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mister Splashy Pants is the winner by a nautical mile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/11/humpback-whales-southern-ocea.jpg" alt="Humpback whales, Southern Ocean." width="600" height="395"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the world couldn't get enough of Mister Splashy Pants with many websites encouraging their readers to vote for 'Splashy'. And as we all know, once the wonderful world of the internet got hold of Mister Splashy Pants, it was all over bar the final splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mister Splashy Pants got a huge 119,367 votes (over 78 percent of the vote) with his nearest rival being Humphrey at 4,329 (less than 3 percent). The rest of the top ten were Aiko, Libertad, Mira, Kaimana, Aurora, Shanti, Amal and Manami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many websites also took credit for the rise and rise of the Splashy-Panted One. Some websites encouraged their readers to cheat and vote more than once, while others like &lt;a href="http://treehugger.com/"&gt;Treehugger&lt;/a&gt; seemed to imply that Mister Splashy Pants wasn't a proper name for a whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sure Treehugger didn't mean it that way but it resulted in a final wave of votes from their readers that took Splashy to an unreachable position at the top of the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who voted for Mister Splashy Pants, now that you've named him, it's time to save him - he might have a great name but he and his friends are still in danger. The only way to be 100 percent sure that 'Splashy' doesn't get harpooned is to stop killing all whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people who voted for a name other than Mister Splashy Pants, take heart. The scientists involved in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt; Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt; tagged 20 humpback whales in the South Pacific. The top 7 names will be used to name whales with a further 5 whales being named by our Whale Defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, a big thanks to YOU, the people who made the name-a-whale competition so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rushmore activists sentenced for civil disobedience</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/civil-disobedience-in-jail-050110/</url><text>
	Civil disobedience to stop climate change had its day in court in the US yesterday when activists pled guilty to climbing Mount Rushmore with their message demanding Obama take leadership on climate change. Four other climate activists who have spent three weeks in jail in Copenhagen for gate crashing a Head of State dinner still await their first hearing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/message-on-mt-rushmore.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what civil disobedience for the climate looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eleven climate activists who proudly staged an historic protest at Mount Rushmore last July appeared in court yesterday for sentencing. All eleven pled guilty to the charge of Climbing Mount Rushmore and received a fine of US$ 460 each. They will also perform 50-100 hours of community service in the National Park system depending on their individual sentences. The judge requested that some or all of that service be performed at Mt. Rushmore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three further charges against the activists were dismissed, as were all charges against Greenpeace.  In a civil decree, Greenpeace has agreed to pay a sum of US$ 30,866, most of which will go to conservation and public park programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single activist who has a history of peaceful civil disobedience was sentenced to 2 days of jail time, which he has already begun serving.&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all the activists, Jessica Miller delivered a statement on the steps of the courthouse: "We climbed Mount Rushmore because we wanted to send a message to President Obama that this is an issue that is important to us, and to the future generations who will face the increasing impacts of global warming, like drought, severe weather and the loss of millions of lives around the world. Global warming is the most important crisis our generation must tackle, and it is time for all of us to stand up to stop it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action at Rushmore sent loud call for climate leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 8th, 2009, Greenpeace activists draped an enormous banner to the right of Lincoln's head on Mt. Rushmore. The banner bore an image of President Obama and read, "America Honors Leaders, Not Politicians: Stop Global Warming" - a challenge to President Obama to take a strong stance on climate change in the leadup to December's UN climate summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Copenhagen, where leaders failed to take action to stop climate change, four Greenpeace activists are still &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-heroes-pay-231209/"&gt; held in jail without trial&lt;/a&gt; for taking action against climate change. By the time they can see a judge, they will have spent three weeks in jail without a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo, International Executive Director of Greenpeace and former apartheid resistant said: "This situation reminds me of the anti-apartheid movement time, when the police entered the houses to make preventive arrests. The arrests are actually a preventive detention without trial and that violates human rights, especially in this case with an arrest for so long."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the most important issue the world faces today. If our leaders do not act, individual citizens have the right to resort to civil disobedience to protect the future of our planet.  Actions designed to spur politicians to action against global warming are themselves a form of community service.&lt;/p&gt;

	Danish police today released from custody four Greenpeace climate protesters who have endured 20 days of pre-trial detention in Copenhagen prison following a harmless peaceful protest staged on the evening of 17 December. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Free at last! "Red Carpet Four" activists speak with journalists after their release from prison. They were held without trial for 20 days.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20 days in prison without trial, the four activists who became known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-heroes-pay-231209/"&gt; "Red Carpet Four"&lt;/a&gt; have been released from prison. Their "crime"? Impressing on world leaders the urgency of action on climate change at a State dinner during the Copenhagen climate summit. Their release comes a day in advance of their detention being reviewed by a Danish judge. However, the four activists still face trial in the Danish courts, and possible prison sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unnecessary detention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the arrests of the Four, Greenpeace guaranteed - as it does in cases where volunteers are involved in peaceful protests - that, if the activists were released, they would voluntarily return to Copenhagen to stand trial. To further facilitate the police investigation, Greenpeace consistently offered its full co-operation to Danish police and provided them with comprehensive details of the activity. A request from Greenpeace asking the Danish police to specify what additional information they needed to know in connection with the case was met with two weeks of silence on the part of the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such prolonged pre-trial detention appears to be a flagrant violation of key articles of international human rights &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;agreements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British human rights lawyer Richard Harvey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only on Tuesday 5 January, did Danish police finally request the names of other individuals who had been in the Greenpeace 'motorcade' on 17 December. Today, these individuals volunteered their details, removing the last conceivable reason for detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish police proved unco-operative in the face of honest efforts on our part to find compromise. As a result, the four activists spent Christmas and New Year in jail, far from their family and without visitation rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Necessary action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 17 December, three of the activists posed as the "Head of State of the Natural World", his "wife" and their security detail. They were waved through the security cordon surrounding the Danish Parliament. Arriving inside the venue for the State banquet they unfolded banners reading, "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of State met the next day for the final sessions of the Copenhagen climate summit. They came no further than producing an empty shell of a document - the 'Copenhagen Accord'. Only five pages in length - two of which contain only blank tables - it contains no legally binding targets for limiting emissions of global warming gases. The summit merely "noted" but did not adopt the Accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24934/delegation-from-earth-about-to.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 13,000 people gave their support to the Red Carpet Four in 24 hours, and announced their support for future civil disobedience. Action is needed and expected from true world leaders in the face of the grave threat of Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, world leaders let the opportunity for agreeing a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement slip through their fingers. We cannot let them fail again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as our 'leaders' behave like 'losers', and continue to drag their feet, they can expect more and more people to find creative ways of expressing their concern and building up pressure for change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Four of our activists face the prospect of Christmas in jail this year over charges relating to our crashing of the Head of State dinner at the Copenhagen climate summit, while the leaders who did practically nothing about the greatest threat to our planet got away scott free.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called for the immediate release of our people at a candle-lit vigil on Saturday night outside the Vestre Fængsel prison, in Copenhagen. Over 100 Greenpeace staff and supporters held banners reading "Freedom From Climate Injustice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/news/features/jail-for-action-to-save-our-pl/"&gt;Click here for short biographies of the activists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crime Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Copenhagen has become a 'climate crime scene' after over 120 Heads of State squandered an historic opportunity to agree a climate saving deal," said Kumi Naidoo, our International Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the perpetrators of the real crime fled the country on private jets, it is shocking that the Danish authorities have decided to detain, without trial, four peaceful protesters over Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Their families will spend a bleak festive season knowing that their loved ones will be languishing in isolation for acting to save the climate. For standing up in defense of the hundreds of millions of people and countless species which will be severely affected by catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kids around the Christmas tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the activists have children at home who will be missing a parent this Christmas. The activists - Juan Lopez de Uralde, Nora Christiansen and Christian Schmutz - are the climate heroes who brought home to world leaders attending last Thursday's banquet with Queen Margrethe the message that leaders were failing the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, police also arrested Joris Thijssen, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace International. He is being held under the same conditions as the other three activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists joined Heads of State from over 120 countries en route to the banquet at the Danish Parliament. Arriving in a three-vehicle convoy, immediately in front of Hilary Clinton, a Greenpeace 'Head of State' and his 'wife' stepped out onto the red carpet as representatives of the millions of people around the world who wanted a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty to head-off climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding up banners reading: "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act", the activists demanded action and not merely words from Presidents and Prime Ministers during their Friday session of the climate summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How far will you go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders have failed us. They have walked away from the global summit in Copenhagen without a treaty to save the climate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not done yet, and neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 15 million people joined in the call from Greenpeace and the other tcktcktck partners such as Avaaz, 350, Oxfam, and WWF, to demand a fair, ambitious, binding treaty to stop climate change. And until we have that, we're going to continue building the biggest mass movement the world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juantxo, Joris, Nora, and Christian were willing to risk jail time to do something about climate change. What are you going to do? You can start by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/getinvolved/become-a-climate-activist?appeal_id=000"&gt; signing up as a climate activist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/me2"&gt;Politicians have failed. It's up to us to ensure that the world gets real action on climate change. We'll send you action bulletins and a monthly newsletter with ways you can be a part of the solution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave up their freedom to get a message out calling for action against climate.

&lt;p&gt;Three of the Heroes from Norway, Spain and Switzerland were arrested after entering the banquet for world leaders, hosted by the Danish Queen Margrethe II. Two of them were dressed as a 'Head of State' and his 'wife', the third their security detail. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/xmas-in-jail-for-climate-activists201209/"&gt; They held up banners that read "Politicians Talk, Leaders Act"&lt;/a&gt; and were led away by police. Danish police later pulled in a fourth activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While real world leaders came to the summit, ate cake, and departed with an empty political agreement that leaves the future of the planet and millions of lives in peril, our four activists will be held in police custody without bail or trial until January 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-violent, creative action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace's Climate Heroes were willing to risk their freedom for a cause," said Mads Christensen, Executive Director of Greenpeace Nordic. "Preventing them from spending the festive season with their families and loved ones is effectively a punishment without trial and has the appearance of a vindictive act. It is unnecessary and totally out of proportion to what they did", said Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condemning the High Court's decision as a further "climate injustice" on top of the collossal political failure at the summit, we're is calling on the public to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwqGDF9IBKQ"&gt;help step up pressure&lt;/a&gt; for the activists' release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the High Court's ruling, their freedom remains at the discretion of Denmark's Chief of Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using only simple props, creativity and a little "audacity of hope" the activists arrived ahead of Hillary Clinton, carrying out an entirely peaceful call for action. Their message helped give voice to the hundreds of millions of people who rarely get the ear of politicians, even as their lives and ecosystems are progressively destroyed as politicians waffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24936/climate_shame.jpg" alt="Climate Shame protest after Copenhagen summit cop-out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Real Crime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historic climate summit which people around the world have been anticipating for the last year resulted in &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/copenhagen-wrap-up-191209/"&gt; what is called the 'Copenhagen Accord'&lt;/a&gt; - an empty document containing no legally binding commitments for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mads Christensen summed up the situation: "Over the past 20 years, our leaders have done virtually nothing to combat climate change. The Copenhagen climate summit was the moment for decisive action. But our leaders failed us. They failed to agree a legally binding treaty to prevent the Earth from warming beyond the crucial threshold of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond this, we can expect impacts to severely affect the survival and wellbeing of millions of people and countless species. Failure to take action to protect the climate is not an option."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act Now - Change the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt;It's time to put politicians on notice! Every email raised in protest about their failure is a step towards forcing them to act in all our interests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make a donation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace relies on individual donations to keep us going, since we don't take government or corporate funds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After four years of campaigning to bring an end to deep-sea bottom trawling, an international agreement has been made to protect just under 25 percent of the high seas from this incredibly destructive fishing method.

            Crewman on the New Zealand bottom trawler dump a large piece of 'Paragorgia' coral dredged from the deep sea in their net. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.southpacificrfmo.org/" target="blank"&gt;countries around the world gathered in Chile&lt;/a&gt; to carve out a fisheries agreement for the South Pacific region. Following a &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/general_assembly/general_assembly_resolutions.htm" target="blank"&gt;resolution made by the UN in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, the countries at the meeting responded strongly with measures to stop destruction of deep water corals, seamounts and other sensitive habitats by vessels that  are bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From September 2007 bottom trawling vessels in the South Pacific will not be able to fish in areas that have or are even likely to have vulnerable marine ecosystems, unless they've completed an assessment to show they won't do any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand fishing industry is responsible for 90 percent of bottom trawling in the region. New Zealand delegates told the meeting these measures would "severely constrain the ability of their fishing industry to continue bottom trawling on the high seas around New Zealand"  and suggested that it may even have the effect of putting an end to bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

	The following is a letter from Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, to our supporters at the conclusion of negotiations by heads of state at the Copenhagen climate summit.

            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International and chair of the TckTckTck campaign.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tens of millions of people around the world who have been working so long and so hard for a fair, ambitious and legally binding (FAB) treaty to come out of the Copenhagen climate summit, I held on to my hope until the very end. My hope our leaders would stop talking and start acting. That they would agree a treaty to avert the threat of climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope has been dashed. Despite a mandate from citizens around the world, and over 120 world leaders attending the Summit, the bickering continued. Our leaders did not lead, they did not act. The summit has failed to produce anything that could be called a FAB deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a chance to change the world. To seize the day, and put us on a path way to peace and prosperity. To embark on a path of climate justice. In doing so, they could have banished the spectre of catastrophic climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust went missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust between developed and developing countries played a large role in preventing any real progress. Leaders from industrialised countries have had plenty of time to commit to ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions and to find the billions of dollars needed to help developing countries both adapt to and mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries showed a willingness throughout the year to take on their share of the effort. Developed countries  failed to move far enough. Bringing up the rear has been the US. It must take the lion's share of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beating climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists around the world tell us we have to ensure global emissions peak by 2015 in order to avoid average global temperature rising more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, industrialised countries as a group - which have the greatest historic responsibility for the problem - must make the largest emission cuts. They also need to provide at least USD 140 billion a year to help developing countries get onto a clean energy pathway, to protect tropical forests, and to adapt to those climate change impacts that are unfortunately now inevitable.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any agreement must be enshrined in a legally binding treaty. This is the job the politicians did not do in Copenhagen.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make them finish what they started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now our job -  yours and mine - to make sure  our 'leaders' see sense, get back to work  get the job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, like many other groups around the world, will continue to peacefully pressure our leaders to do what must be done to save human lives and protect species which cannot speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people are recognising the urgency of climate change. We believe there is an historic inevitability of forcing nations to act. The question is, whether we can force them to take the necessary action soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The final rub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel irony I have just learned that the three Greenpeace activists who, posing as world leaders, entered the Danish Palace for the State Dinner on Thursday night to unfurl a banner calling for a real climate deal are to spend the next three weeks in jail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be away from their families over Christmas and the New Year. The real  leaders, who attempted to get real action are now in jail, while the alleged 'leaders' got clean away, and are fleeing the Copenhagen climate crime scene in private jets and 747s.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century.

            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace spectacularly crashes Queen's dinner party at Copenhagen Climate summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-spectacularly-crash/</url><text>
	We thought it unfair that among the Heads of State invited to the Queen's dinner in Copenhagen, that a representative of the whole planet wasn't invited. Earth needed a voice, it needed representation. So we sent two to crash the party.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Delegation from Earth about to be evicted from Danish Queen's dinner party with 100 heads of state at Copenhagen climate summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the Copenhagen climate summit comes to a close, the future of our planet lies in the hands of world leaders that have just breezed into town. And somehow, instead of getting down to the nitty gritty, they were dining with the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders might have been expecting just another photo opportunity in Copenhagen, but that was before we invited ourselves to dinner. We thought they might need a reminder it's time to step forward and steer these climate negotiations in the right direction on the final day of talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only precious hours left till the end of the summit, activists in a three-car convoy joined the motorcade, carrying our very own Head of State to the dinner at the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival, our distinguished representative and her husband entered the dinner and held up two banners reading "Politicians Talk Leaders Act." They were there to represent the 11 million of you that have demanded that world leaders take personal responsibility at the summit and deliver a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure they got the message loud and clear, 25 activists scaled lampposts outside of the security cordon with banners demanding action from the world leaders on their way to dinner.  "Don't betray our children's future" was projected onto the Parliament building itself, as well as the Prime Minister's office, in English, French and German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the industrialised world has failed to show anything like the leadership that is urgently needed to get a deal that will prevent climate change from spiraling out of control. Their lack of action will condemn millions of people to ever-increasing impacts of climate chaos. We can't let them get away with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, they promised us a real deal to save the climate and that deal would be agreed in Copenhagen, now. The time has come for world leaders to deliver on their promises and sign a deal with long term financing, ambitious emissions cuts and that is legally binding. They have the power to make it happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your voice heard and &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;join the 13 million people that have demanded action on climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/do-not-fail/"&gt;13 Million people have demanded a fair ambitious binding treaty to stop climate change. Let's make it 15 million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;Your contributions are what keep us in action. We don't let corporations or governments feed us, so we're free to bite their hands. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate negotiations kick off</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-copenhagen-kickoff071109/</url><text>
	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>McVictory</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Victory as fast food giant pledges to help protect the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In an historic deal that has impacts far beyond the golden arches and into the global agricultural market, McDonald's is now the leading company in the campaign to halt deforestation for the expansion of soya farming in the Amazon. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="McDonald's tree hugger" src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/7/treeclown.gif" alt="McDonald's tree hugger" width="600" height="450"&gt;After massive consumer pressure, McDonald's will no longer sell chicken fed on soya grown in deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to enormous pressure from the thousands of emails and letters sent to their European headquarters by you, our supporters, McDonald's has agreed to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Soya key driver of Amazon destruction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the seemingly unstoppable expansion of soya farming in the Amazon had become one of the main threats to the world's largest rainforest. The soya wasn't being used to feed the world; instead it was used to feed farm animals destined for fast food and supermarket chains across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our campaign exposing the food retailer's role in rainforest destruction. Our report, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="/international/en/publications/reports/eating-up-the-amazon/"&gt; Eating Up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, detailed how McDonald's and other companies were implicated in deforestation, land-grabbing, slavery and violence. Since then there has been a sea change in attitude among the food industry towards the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that McDonald's and other big food retailers have worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pressure for change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to the plan, the companies' massive buying power has created a huge demand for soya that hasn't been grown in the ashes of the rainforest. This put pressure on the 'big five' soya traders - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cargill, ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Amaggi &lt;/span&gt;to come to the negotiating table with the future of large areas of the Amazon rainforest at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pressure, the soya traders committed to a limited two year moratorium of buying soya from deforested areas. The two-year time frame of the soya traders moratorium risks being no more than a token gesture, unless the traders deliver real change to protect the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the moratorium stays until proper procedures for legality and governance are in place and until there is an agreement with the Brazilian Government and key stakeholders on long term protection for the Amazon rainforest. A working group will be established, made up of soya traders, producers, NGOs, and government to put in place an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Van Bergen, Vice President of McDonald's Europe said, "When we were first alerted to this issue by Greenpeace, we immediately reached out to our suppliers, other NGOs and other companies to resolve this issue and take action. We are determined to do the right thing together with our suppliers and the Brazilian government, to protect the Amazon from further destruction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The two-year time frame set for the initiative is, we hope, indicative of the sense of urgency with which the soya traders wish to implement the governance programme and all of its conditions. We expect that should some of the measures take longer than the stated two years to implement, the moratorium would remain in existence until all commitments have been fulfilled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies, however, who refuse to play ball. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/kfc-180506/"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; (KFC), have point-blank refused to discuss their role in Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior has returned to Larnaca, Cyprus, after its second trip to Beirut delivering a total of 60 tonnes of urgently needed humanitarian supplies on behalf of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). A further hundred tonnes are still scheduled to be transported.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/8/rw-beirut.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior arrives in Beirut with supplies for the MSF humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF was planning to ship some 180 tonnes from Larnaca to Lebanon, butwas experiencing serious difficulties in finding reliabletransportation since very few boats are willing to sail to Lebanongiven the conflict. This why we offered the use of the Rainbow Warrior,which was already in the Mediterranean. However, delivery to Beirut isonly the first step in an arduous journey to those in need. (For moreabout the work of MSF in Lebanon and other parts of the worldgo to &lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;www.msf.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MSF is pleased to have drugs, medical supplies, baby milk and reliefgoods transported to Beirut by the Rainbow Warrior, however, this isonly the first step", said Bart Rijs, of MSF in Beirut. "Our teams willhave to get these supplies from the harbour to the people who need themmost: to the displaced, but also to those who remain in the south.MSF's teams will try to bring supplies to the hospitals and to thepeople in the areas were the bombardment and the fighting are theworst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not designed for cargo transport, the Rainbow Warrior has capacity fortransporting 40 tonnes, equivalent to 105 pallets. The trip fromLarnaca to Beirut takes around 16 hours. In total each trip takes some35 hours, including up to 3 hours to off load in Beirut. To minimizesecurity risk the Israeli and the Lebanese authorities are informed ofeach crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how many more rotations the Rainbow Warrior will make for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières has over 40 international staff running fixedand mobile clinics, supplying hospitals and clinics with drugs, anddelivering relief goods in areas that are severely affected by theconflict.

	We don’t think the Amazon should be cut down for chicken feed. And from Brazil to Europe, our activists have faced violence and arrest to protest this environmental crime.

            KFC is implicated in Amazon destruction
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our investigative report, 'Eating up the Amazon' showed how soya beans grown in the Amazon were going into many fast-food items in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among them, soy grown by clearing the Amazon is going into the making of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). And some people don’t want us to do anything about that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists attacked, arrested:&lt;/span&gt; Violence erupted at an illegal soy export facility in the Amazon as employees and associates of Cargill, owner and operator of the port, targeted Greenpeace activists who were protesting the continued destruction of the Amazon rainforest for growing soy. Despite the Cargill port being built in violation of Brazilian law, it continues to operate. Soy exported from this port go to many parts of the world including Europe where it is used to feed animals destined to be fried-up in fast food outlets like KFC.  Activists in Europe have &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2006/greenpeace-slams-us-commoditie/"&gt; shut down Cargill plants in France and the UK&lt;/a&gt; in solidarity with their Brazilian colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a report from Gavin Edwards, our international forest campaigner, about his arrival in Brazil:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been in the Amazon almost a week now and from the moment I arrived I stepped into a very polarized battle over the future of the Amazon. My first indication of the tension was a bumper sticker on a truck outside the airport with the words 'Fora Greenpeace', meaning 'Greenpeace Out'. Many more of these stickers were on trucks around the town of Santarem. It turns out that by showing this sticker on your car or truck, you receive a discount on petrol at a local gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An editorial in the local newspaper Journal de Santarem was also quite damning of Greenpeace, attempting to link us to everything from hunger to abortion, but of course failed to discuss the real issue, the ongoing and rampant deforestation and unsustainable development in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first protest involved simply parachuting an activist into a soy field with a message written on the parachute, and even this was enough to bring out a small group of angry farmers -- the parachutist had a narrow escape. Our next attempt to protest at the forest destruction over the weekend was to have 80 people in a deforested area to make a human banner, arranging the people's bodies to spell out the protest message. This activity was cancelled due to the strong possibility of violence from the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="KFC banner" src="/international/PageFiles/25551/kfcbanner.jpg" alt="KFC banner" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the violence directed towards us, a team of activists on boats projected a video on soy and deforestation in front of the town of Santarem on Saturday night. Many of the local &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos &lt;/span&gt;are actually farmers from the south of Brazil who have recently moved to Santarem in pursuit of land grabbing and profits from deforestation and farming.  Their reaction was swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes a mob assembled and began firing fireworks at our volunteers. They assaulted one of our photographers, and the photographer of a local newspaper as well. This time it seems the local hooligans (who are a small minority) went too far, and the mood in Santarem has swung against them. The subsequent editorial in the Gazeta de Santarem is quite different from earlier criticisms. It deplores the use of violence by the farmers, questions why the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gauchos&lt;/span&gt; are being violent towards Greenpeace, and wonders if the&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; gauchos &lt;/span&gt;will next turn on the people of Santarem with their tactics of fear and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gazeta de Santarem has front-page headlines and photos of the soy producers attacking the photographer, and a quote from one soy producer saying that Santarem is only full of Indians and lazy people. Now the bumper stickers on trucks seem to be fewer and fewer. The tide may well be turning against the soy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're keeping up the pressure on the big soy producers like Cargill over the next few days, including unfurling a protest banner in a deforested area today with the words '&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken – Amazon Criminal&lt;/span&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more activities planned in the Amazon, and we're sure those with an economic interest in forest destruction will continue with their violent tactics. For now however, it seems that peace is beginning to win over violence in Santarem, and it looks like there is a real chance that the Amazon may remain mostly green, if our supporters keep up the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

	Perhaps more than anyone else, Bob Hunter invented Greenpeace.  His death on May 2nd 2005, of cancer, marks the passing of a true original, one of the heroes of the environmental movement. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/2/bob-hunter-on-phyllis-cormack.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bob Hunter (left) with Ben Metcalfe, aboard the first Greenpeace voyage to oppose nuclear weapons testing in Amchitka.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the word "Greenpeace" hadn't yet been coined. Bob was a hippy journalist in Vancouver, a town which he described as having "the biggest concentration of tree-huggers, radicalized students, garbage-dump stoppers, shit-disturbing unionists, freeway fighters, pot smokers and growers, aging Trotskyites, condo killers, farmland savers, fish preservationists, animal rights activists, back-to-the-landers, vegetarians, nudists, Buddhists, and anti-spraying, anti-pollution marchers and picketers in the country, per capita, in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind bombs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student of Marshall McLuhan, he was bent on changing the world with what he termed "media mindbombs" -- consciousness-changing sounds and images to blast around the world in the guise of news. He got involved with a few folks in a church basement who wanted to stop a US nuclear weapons test off Amchitka, which he called the "Don't Make a Wave Committee".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sailing into the bomb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their plans were going nowhere until Marie Bohlen suggested that the group simply sail a ship into the test site. Bob thought it was a perfect "mindbomb," and on September 15, 1971, he and 11 other rag-tag activists would sail out to challenge the greatest military force on Earth in a rusting fishing boat they called "The Greenpeace." In doing so, they set off a wave of public support and protest which closed the US-Canadian border for the first time since 1812, ultimately shut the testing programme down, and created a new force for environmental and peace activism which continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace bears his mark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, Bob's madcap creativity, strategic smarts, and hard-nosed journalistic sense of story would indelibly mark the Greenpeace brand of action. From the pack ice of Newfoundland, where he dyed the whitecoats of Harp Seal pups to make them commercially worthless, to the Pacific Ocean where he stood between Russian harpoons and the whales they were hunting, he inspired a new brand of personal environmental activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaman, mystic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bob was a storyteller, a shaman, a word-magician, a Machiavellian mystic, and he dared to inject a sense of humour into the often shrill and sanctimonious job of changing the world," says Greenpeace Executive Director Gerd Leipold. "He was funny and brave and audacious, inspiring in his refusal to accept the limits of the practical or the probable. He revelled in life's ability to deliver little miracles in the form of impossibilities achieved, and Greenpeace will forever bear the mark of his crazy, super-optimistic faith in the wisdom of tilting at windmills."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warriors of the Rainbow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Hunter chronicled the birth of Greenpeace in his book "Warriors of the Rainbow." It was a masterful feat of storytelling, one which attracted a further generation of young people into the ranks of the organisation. In its introduction he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We fought... an unequal battle against American and French nuclear weapons makers; Russian, Japanese, and Australian whalers; Norwegian and Canadian seal hunters; multinational oil consortiums and pesticide manufactures; cynical politicians; angry workers; and, again and again, ourselves. The people involved were men and women, young and old, not all of them brave or wise, who found themselves face-to-face with the fullest ecological horrors of the century..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storymaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Hunter's stock stories was the tale of how he'd stumbled on to the Cree Indian myth of the "Warriors of the Rainbow" -- a legendary tribe of spirits who would rescue nature when the Earth became sick. The story involved a gypsy dulcimer maker, an old set of fenceposts, and the gift of a book which Hunter claimed leapt into his hands -- quite literally -- when The Greenpeace dropped down a steep swell on its way to Amchitka. The story itself was magical and mythological, and over the years Hunter would embellish and polish it into a hilarious and inspirational piece of campfire folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awful child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1941. In his own words "I was an awful, rebellious, early attention-defficient kid who was loved by my art and English teachers, but hated by the rest. I cheated by scribbling novels when I was supposed to be doing schoolwork." He became a journalist for the Winnipeg Tribune and later wrote a column for the Vancouver Sun in which he featured environmental subjects. He quit writing the column when he joined the first Greenpeace voyage to save the whales, becoming a reporter explicitly to ensure his somewhat less than objective "message" would reach a global audience, because "the subjective stuff written by columnists [was] never picked up by the wire services."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalism as opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He readily confessed that this made him "a traitor to my profession," but believed he had a higher calling: "If we ignore [the] laws of ecology we will continue to be guilty of crimes against the earth. We will not be judged by men for these crimes, but with a justice meeted out by the earth itself. The destruction of the earth will lead, inevitably, to the destruction of ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter became president of the Greenpeace Foundation in 1973, and served in that post until 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Toronto's City TV as an ecology specialist in 1988, and for years hosted a highly successful morning TV spot for Breakfast TV in his bathrobe, in which he read the day's newspaper headlines and sputtered scandalously witty commentaries in a form of rapid-fire stand-up journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisor, speaker, comedian-in-chief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years he continued to contribute to Greenpeace as an advisor and occasional speaker, and kept up good relations with the organisation's original luminaries, including many who were no longer on speaking terms with one other. He authored several books and founded a tongue-in-cheek religion, the Whole Earth Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent book, Rex Weyler writes about reflecting with Hunter on their experiences in the early days of Greenpeace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ironies and tension of history simultaneously provided the gift of history: that we got to live, to see the flourishing Earth, the flying fish, dolphins, caribou, seal pups, the raging sea, the blue light of morning, the miracle and terror of survival all rolled into one; and that we were blessed with an opportunity to serve it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Hunter made much of his opportunity to serve the Earth, and Greenpeace will always be blessed with his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

	We have offered Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) the use of the Rainbow Warrior for transporting much-needed supplies to Lebanon. The vessel was already in the Mediterranean and has now docked in Larnaca, Cyprus for loading medical supplies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/rainbow-warrior-ii-sailing-thr.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/rainbow-warrior-ii-sailing-thr.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rainbow Warrior will help MSF deliver vital medical supplies to Lebanon.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We understood that there were major difficulties for humanitarianorganisations such as MSF in getting bulk supplies quickly from Cyprusto Beirut," says Bruno Rebelle, programme director of GreenpeaceInternational. "We are very happy that we can contribute to a temporarysolution to these problems as we are, like everyone else, deeplyconcerned about the consequences of the fighting in the Middle-East forthe civilian population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF currently has almost 100 tonnes of medical materials and otherrelief supplies waiting for transport in a warehouse in Larnaca, withanother 80 tonnes scheduled to arrive there soon. Though some of thesupplies get through to Beirut, the bulk of them are stuck in theabsence of sufficient transport capacity. Very few boats are availablefor sailing to Lebanon as there is little guarantee for safe passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have two major transportation problems," says Jerome Oberreit,operational director for MSF in Brussels. "To date it has been verydifficult to move large volumes of relief goods from Beirut to southernLebanon by road. We rely on cars which we stack with boxes to drivealong the severely damaged and insecure road to Tyre; trucks have beenhit by missiles so truck drivers are reluctant to move into thesouthern region. On top of that, we have major problems in getting ourmaterials to Beirut quickly enough. In the short term, the offer fromGreenpeace means a partial solution of one of our two problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has capacity for transporting 40 tonnes, equivalentto 105 pallets. It is not clear yet how many rotations the vessel willmake for MSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msf.org/"&gt;Medecins Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt; has around30 international staff working in areas in Lebanon that are severelyaffected by the conflict. The emphasis in MSF's activities is onsupporting Lebanese health workers, setting up additional health postsand mobile clinics where necessary, and distributing basic materials(shelter, hygiene kits, cooking utensils, baby powder milk) todisplaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

	"It is 8:30 am and I and 30 activists have been sitting on drilling platform #4 for an hour and a half. We can see workers from the Defense Construction Agency gathering on the beach of Camp Schwab, the US Marine Corp base at Henoko, Okinawa. They are about to board a chartered fishing boat and come out and try to drill the first of 64 holes into the life sustaining coral reef. But for the 300th consecutive day, we are not going to let them." - Yuka Ozaki, 500m off the coast of Japan.

            A gentle dugong near Okinawa, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, construction of a US Marine Corps airbase for helicopters at Henoko, Okinawa, off the coast of Japan was agreed. The planned 2,600-meter runway complete with hangers, control towers and fuel storage was even being funded by Japanese taxpayers to the tune of US$10 billion. That US$10 billion is set to pay for the destruction of the habitat of sea life such as the gentle dugong - only 12 of which are confirmed to remain in Japanese waters. The beautiful Okinawa reef is home to Japan's last remaining population of critically endangered dugong, as well as other marine mammals and sea turtles. The UN Environment Programme has called for the creation of a marine reserve to protect the dugong. Instead the plan is to dynamite the reef and build the runway through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local opposition has been so strong that construction was not started until late 2004. In 1997, local people voted overwhelmingly to reject the base, but the local mayor was forced by the central government to agree to the project. He resigned in disgrace after signing the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.or.jp/dugong/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25875/okinawa_action.jpg" alt="" align="middle" border="0"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org/henoko" target="_blank"&gt;Make the virtual airbase disappear in the online protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courageous local residents, however, have so far been successful in preventing the drilling of test holes into the sensitive coral reef. Every day for the last 300 days they have occupied the drilling towers about half a kilometre offshore, preventing any further construction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 84-year-old local man said, "We know for sure, that building the airbase is not the right thing to do. There are a plenty of sea creatures which are supporting our life here. We always appreciate the richness of ocean life: we have top shell, octopus, magaki-shell and seaweed. Once the base is built, there will be no future for our children. I can't let it disappear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Rainbow Warrior arrives to support these local residents and try to ensure a US military base doesn't mean the demise of the Okinawa dugong.&lt;/p&gt;

	A container ship currently heading from southern India to the US represents a small victory in the fight against corporate crime across the globe. The ship is carrying 320 tonnes of toxic mercury contaminated waste which comes from a closed plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of consumer products giant Unilever.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unilever agrees to clean up its toxic mercury mess in south India.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unilever mercury thermometer production plant was set up in TamilNadu, India in 1983 after being shipped wholesale from it previous location in New York State in the US. It is a classic tactic of the chemical industry to ship plants that are too dirty or inefficient for the US or Europe to areas such as India and extend their life where environmental and safety standards are lower. Hence the industry can continue to make profits from pollution for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Moving the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant at Kodaikanal imported mercury from the US and re-exported the thermometers back to the US. Mercury is a potent toxin affecting the nervous system of people and animals and a highly dangerous pollutant. Lax safety standards at the plant left workers with mercury poisoning and large amounts of mercury contaminated waste were dumped in the surrounding areas in complete disregard for the local communities by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local environmental groups and Greenpeace first exposed the mercury dumping scandal in May 2001. Subsequent protests by locals forced the closure of the plant but the contaminated waste was left littering the site and surrounding area. Investigations by the pollution control authorities revealed the pollution to be far worse than the company had admitted with soil contamination 600-800 the legal levels and approximately 17 times more mercury was unaccounted for than the company estimates. The authorities ordered the company to clean up the site and safely treat the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananthapadmanabhan, one of our campaigners in India, is studying the clean up: "We will be keeping a close watch on all future remedial actions by the company. Several thousand tonnes of toxic wastes and contaminated soil are still to be properly identified and contained. Now that the clean up has begun in earnest, compensation and health care for affected ex-workers should be immediately brought on to the agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste will be treated at a special plant in the US. The start of the clean up is a big victory for campaigners in India where other polluted hotspots cause by irresponsible companies, like Bhopal, abound.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mad Max is here</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Mad-Max-is-here/</url><text>
	We went on an expedition to see up close — and from above, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) — the real situation of the main reservoirs of the south-eastern Brazil. What we saw shows that the worst of the water crisis is yet to come.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" src="/international/Global/international/photos/forests/2015/mad-max-is-here.jpg" alt="Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: &amp;quot;Without Forests, There's No Water&amp;quot; © Greenpeace" width="800" height="532"&gt;Greenpeace activists hold a banner that reads: "Without Forests, There's No Water" © Greenpeace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out onto the "craquelure" bottom of a bone dry reservoir gives one a sinking feeling. Actually, the realization that we were not on the set of a post-apocalyptic film, like "Mad Max", but rather in the middle of an enormous reservoir that until just recently supplied millions of people with water, is enough to send anyone into despair. We were at the Serra Azul reservoir, in Minas Gerais, one of the main parts of the Paraopeba System, which ensures – or ensured – water for most of Greater Belo Horizonte and its 5.7 million inhabitants. Throughout the entire Paraopeba water basin, only 12% of the native forest remains. "Without vegetation on its banks, the reservoirs have a much more difficult time holding water since they suffer from erosion, pollution and silting," said Cristiane Mazzetti, a member of the Greenpeace Forest Campaign. "It's high time that our political leaders understood that, without the forest, there is no water."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot sun makes the thousands of cracks in the soil even more dramatic. After decades of being submerged, a bridge surfaces in the middle of the reservoir. The water that is left is concentrated at the bottom of the river channel. Way down at the bottom. At the moment, at the end of the rainy season in 2015, the Serra Azul is at around 9.10% of its capacity. In 2014, the average for the reservoir for the month of March was 44.3%. In other words, we are recording the lowest level in history for this reservoir for this time of the year. Our throats parched, we realized that we were witnessing an environmental collapse of enormous proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Serra Azul reservoir was the last stop on a six-day expedition to see some of the main reservoirs in Brazil's south-eastern region. Completed by Greenpeace at the beginning of April in partnership with the monitoring company Terra Sense, the objective of the expedition was to launch UAVs from different points along the reservoirs to record the level of water and the soil use of the surrounding areas. In all we traveled a thousand kilometers. We walked up hills, entered thickets, swampy plains and remote trails to access points that had been previously mapped as favourable for launching the UAV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="600" height="450" data="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgreenpeacebrasil%2Fsets%2F72157652279348729%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157652279348729&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAVs, with their ability to capture aerial images precisely and quickly, make them an agile technological tool for research and other purposes. Without flying over any urban areas, our expedition was able to conduct 14 flights, with over four hours in the air, mapping 607 hectares in and around three reservoirs. Our efforts resulted in 668 photographs of the reservoirs and the surrounding area. When our expedition set off, we knew we would be the first to use UAV technology to monitor the state of reservoirs in Brazil. What we did not know was what we would witness with our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the Paraibuna reservoir, in Vale do Paraíba do Sul, at less than 5% of its capacity. This is at the end of the rainy season. In other words, it's not going to get any better. Just the opposite, the outlook for this year is frightening. During this same period last year (the beginning of April 2014), the Paraibuna was at 40% of its capacity. The Paraibuna, one of the most important for a system that supplies over eight million people in Rio de Janeiro, has less than 13% of the original forest in its water basin. Only 26% of its Permanent Preservation Areas, including hilltops and riversides, have been preserved. What one finds there is a lot of barren hillsides, pastures, silted riverbanks and, primarily in the region of the sources of the Paraibuna, in the upper Serra do Mar, rivers and springs that have run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Son, you see my cattle grazing over there? It was all water less than two years ago. Suddenly everything dried out," recalled Paulo Ribeiro da Silva, a milk producer who lives near the reservoir. Mr. da Silva explains that he grew up in the region and has never seen the water surface shrink this much. "If the government helped us to maintain the riverside forests and protect the springs, the situation would be different," he said. Even milk producers know that without the forest, there is no water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="A map of the Brazilian south-east" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/Global/brasil/image/2015/Maio/mapa_bg.jpg" alt="A map of the Brazilian south-east" width="600" height="609"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Paraíba do Sul basin the expedition traveled to the region that has become emblematic of the water crisis that affects the entire Brazilian south-east: the Cantareira System, the most important supply system for the largest metropolis in South America. Since mid-2014 pumping water from the so-called "dead volume," the Cantareira is a system of interlinked reservoirs that supply over five million people in Greater São Paulo. Or should we say supplied, since the state government has transferred part of that previously serviced by the Cantareira to other reservoirs in the wake of its collapse. From the edge of the reservoir or the top of the hills, we observed the Cantareira which is under capacity by 11% (without counting the "dead volume," which entered into use in May 2014). That's right, the level of the Cantareira stands at -11%. A year ago, this figure was around 14%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched the UAV from three different points at the Jaguari-Jacareí reservoir. For those who are concerned about the future of São Paulo, a warning: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/S0uUYiP1cLY"&gt;the images captured from above are dire.&lt;/a&gt; Only 15% of the forests of the basin are standing. Of the rivers that make up the basin, 76.5% are without their riparian forests. If the vegetation in the basin contributes to the water cycle on a regional scale and the riparian forests, in turn, protect rivers and springs from impacts like erosion and silting, our system is seriously degraded. "The economy of the region is already feeling the effects of the depletion of the reservoirs," said Marcelo Delduque, owner of the farm Fazenda Serrinha, located along the edge of the Jaguari-Jacareí. "A lot of people who depended on tourism and leisure activities have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0uUYiP1cLY?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the consequences of the water crisis go far beyond the economy. The collapse of the main reservoirs that supply the major cities of the south-east compromise the sustainability of the region, affecting the health, quality of life and survival of its population. The expedition increased the awareness that the south-east and other Brazilian regions have worked themselves into a corner and there is no magic solution. A fundamental step forward would be to stop deforestation now. "And begin to reforest, because this is the only way to recover the ability of the water basins to produce and store water," said Cristiane Mazzetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of millions of Brazilians depends on the recuperation of these reservoirs and on all of us to establish a new relationship with water resources and the forests. On a daily basis the Amazon releases 20 billion tons of water vapor into the atmosphere, forming flying rivers that flow to the south, south-east and mid-west regions of Brazil, irrigating fields and filling reservoirs. By continuing to deforest the Amazon and not recuperating the vegetation and the water basins that supply the country's major cities, Brazil is flirting with unprecedented socio-environmental disaster and compromising the future of new generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 1.1 million Brazilians have formed a movement to end deforestation in Brazil. We want to present the national congress with a bill that will prohibit new deforestation, protecting the forests that remain. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/amazon/"&gt;You can also join movement by signing the petition for Zero Deforestation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Asian Tsunami: environmental and humanitarian disaster</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tsunami-and-the-environment/</url><text>
	On December 26 a massive tsunami swept through the Indian Ocean region to become arguably the largest natural disaster in living memory. Questions are now being asked: what are the environmental impacts of this tragedy?  Did damaged environments contribute to the extent of the impact? And perhaps most importantly, what can be done to make sure that the long-term welfare of survivors is considered?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/humanitarian-and-medical-aid-o.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/humanitarian-and-medical-aid-o.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Humanitarian and medical aid organised by Medecins Sans Frontieres is being loaded onto the Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, is currently assisting the French organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in delivering emergency relief aid. Greenpeace activists have been involved in the relief effort in India, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere since December 26. Although we are not an aid organisation, we felt this was the best way we could contribute most effectively. The Rainbow Warrior was already in the region and access to many of the most remote and isolated areas is only possible by ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Environmental impacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are also beginning to explore the possibilities of contributing to assessments of the environmental impacts caused by the tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial reports indicate that natural ecological systems such as coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands have suffered extensive impacts. Important research facilities for studying and monitoring these environments are reportedly also severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tsunami has highlighted the vulnerability of the sensitive marine environments, such as mangroves, that are the breeding grounds for many marine species and that represent the livelihood of thousands of communities that depend on them for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is undertaking a full environmental impact assessment of this natural disaster, and this, in conjunction with the various other initiatives underway, should lead to a good understanding of the scale and extent of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Redeveloping for the future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that healthy mangroves and coral reefs formed an essential defence against the tsunami. Damage appears to be much worse in areas where these natural defences were destroyed or degraded by shrimp farming and irresponsible coastal development for industry and tourism. Any recovery effort should ensure the conservation and restoration of these vital coastal ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the protection of human life in such an extreme event, but also considering the resilience of ecological systems, it is essential that redevelopment proceeds with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course right now we must give our efforts to those who have suffered in this tragedy. We have and will continue to offer support to MSF during the relief effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the most urgent needs are met, and the focus falls more clearly upon redevelopment and reconstruction, then we will contribute to recovery efforts to ensure that the approach to reconstruction addresses both short and longer term social and environmental needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s officially spring in the Northern Hemisphere but nobody seems to have told the weather gods in Lesbos. As 50-knot gusts of wind thump the island from the south, at least they bring welcome warm air and time to put some thoughts to paper.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHTX_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the prevailing north wind that raises our guard as it puts the Turkish beaches in the lee and gives refugees the wrong impression of sea conditions further out on their perilous journey. It's a colder wind that brought snow and countless cases of hypothermia in the past. Beware the northerlies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, Greenpeace is wrapping up its refugee rescue operation on the Greek island of Lesbos and handing over to Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) who are ready to take full charge of the operation for the longer term. The last few weeks have been quiet with only the odd refugee boat managing to break through the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ"&gt;new dictate from Brussels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen off the winter and should be proud of it. Nearly 100 Greenpeace staff and volunteers have donated their time, skill and energy over the past five months in a spirit that can only be described as "old school". MSF and Greenpeace have acted as one throughout, and much of the handover is in name only as many of the hardened crew continue their work under a different badge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summing up the last few months is a tricky task – no two days have been the same. It's easiest explained in numbers, but numbers fail dismally in this crisis of humanity, especially with politicians and media banding them around like a currency on the stock exchange. Numbers fail to describe the pictures etched into our minds: an outstretched hand, a semiconscious gaze or even the reassuring nod from a colleague as life and death decisions unfold amidst hysterical screams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSF and Greenpeace assisted 18,117 people at sea between November 28, 2015 and March 23, 2016 and conducted 361 operations on the north coast of Lesbos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main categories of refugee boats. Neither is fit for purpose. Inflatables carry up to 70 people and come in variable quality, occasionally with the glue still sticky. ‘Wooden boats' describe any type of boat that isn't a rubber duck, and these are the most dangerous: they tend to capsize and sink quickly when they take on too much water, or break up as they hit the shore. Both types of boat are filled with petrified souls, but when the term ‘wooden boat' rings out over the VHF radio it quickens the pulse and hand to the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPJNV_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Crew onboard a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) / Greenpeace inflatable boat during an operation assisting boats in distress off the northern coast of Lesvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team up on the hill (call signs Romeo &amp;amp; Juliette) perform a dizzying array of tasks, from spotting and guiding refugee boats to relaying information between officials and non-governmental agencies responding on water and land. Here's a glimpse of what goes on behind the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore – 171 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a calm day this can be a happy affair. When the people in boats realise we are friend not foe, the singing can start. After all the hardship endured (one can only imagine) they are about to make it! Smiles emerge as we exchange the thumbs up sign and cultural mediators and medics begin to assess the condition of the new arrivals from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the stretch of coastline we cover, there are about a dozen safe landing beaches. We know them well now and I no longer need to refer to GPS coordinates as I radio an estimated time of arrival to Romeo/Juliette: "send the medics to Yogi or Chapel" or "ground support required at Aphrodite or Sheep Farm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it's just a case of tweaking their course, as they are not accustomed to sailing. Before today, many had never seen the sea, so they are not to know that a lighthouse signifies danger – and lives have been lost on the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV9_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other kinds of assistance (such as solving an engine problem) – 141 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Check the fuel, check the fuel and check the fuel again" is the phrase I remember from the ‘Beginners Guide to Outboard Maintenance and Troubleshooting'. How true in this case. Outboards don't run for long if the air valve on the tank is closed, the choke is out and 10 people are sitting on the fuel line. The lucky ones break down after they have crossed the Greek/Turkish border where help awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not authorised to cross the red dotted line on the GPS that signifies the border, so unless there's a "mayday" case, boats here are left to the mercy of the Turkish coastguard (we have seen some shocking footage). And I very much doubt if the refugees  get a refund from the smugglers. Anything up to 3,000 euros is paid per person, making it the most expensive six-nautical mile journey on the planet. Anywhere else and you could charter your own helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dead boat in the water is also highly exposed to the weather. Waves lap over the sides and people stacked in the middle get soaked (usually the most vulnerable – children, women and elderly). Getting the engine going again quickly is the best solution. Our cultural mediators (many of whom were once refugees themselves) are now well versed in Outboard Troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHV8_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance to shore with towing – 24 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting fails but the boat is still in reasonable condition, towing is the best solution. But first we must secure permission of the Hellenic Coast Guard – we do not want to risk being accused of ‘people smuggling'. It's a complex political game out on the water! There are many players to navigate: the EU border agency Frontex has Norwegian, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Swedish boats out there. Add to that NATO warships, Spanish lifeguards and German, Greek and Dutch volunteer boats ... the Greek Coast Guard has the final say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the practicalities of towing a rubber boat. Most have no reliable anchor points and there's a danger that you can pull them apart at the seams. The solution we've found is to put a thick towrope down the middle of the boat and ask the stronger people on board to hold tight with their bare hands. You won't find this technique in any RYA Manual of Seamanship but then you won't find this situation either. It works pretty well and is quick to deploy with the help of our interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPHU4_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="MSF and Greenpeace Launch Life Saving Operations in the Aegean Sea" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass MOB (man overboard) / MOB / capsizing / swamped / evacuation / transfer – 25 boats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the statistic that haunts our dreams at night. On 25 occasions many lives would have been lost had we not been on the scene. As it was, a total of four people died during our operations. Each occasion was different and the statistic covers a wide range of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter occasions it may be a swamped inflatable with a broken engine, but that could mean the kids in the middle were up to their necks, babies being held precariously aloft and hypothermia and panic in equal measure. The transfer of people from their boat to ours was rarely a calm affair. We'd do a co-ordinated sandwich manoeuvre with our two boats and try to offload the kids and babies first. We soon realised that it was important to take some mothers too as there is not much you can do with a baby in each arm! Sometimes outright panic would engulf the boat and a mad scramble would ensue. Often a stern word was required to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other occasions brought medical emergencies. There is a limit to how much medical treatment can be done during a rescue although we did carry oxygen and medical supplies. On one occasion the MSF medic successfully resuscitated a baby that had been in the water and had stopped breathing. On another we lost a four-year-old boy to the elements. Many arrived in the first, second and third stages of hypothermia so we would pull space blankets from our pockets like magicians. We were usually only a few miles to the nearest port and a waiting MSF ambulance, so in most cases the best option was to scoop up shivering children and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." src="/international/Global/international/photos/other/2016/lesbos/GP0STPI1R_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Wednesday 16th December 2015. Two children and three people missing as boat carrying over 150 refugees from Iraq capsizes off the coast of Lesbvos, Greece." width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst incident was on December 16. Shortly after being threatened with arrest from Frontex (we are not allowed to patrol) a wooden boat capsized and sank. A total of 85 men, women, children and babies were in the water. We were the first responders to arrive, within 20 minutes. It was a scene from the Titanic. Death hung in the air. The Greenpeace boats were magnificent. Our crew grabbed, hauled and wrestled folks on-board, but still we lost two people that day. The Frontex boat couldn't do much as their freeboard was too high – they put out ropes instead! They don't threaten us with arrest any more and these days often request our assistance. I pray we never get another day like that, for everyone on the water it was traumatic, a day we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all these rescues it's the faces that we remember. Our contact with the refugees is intense, but it is over quickly. We check their pulses and breathing but there is no time for names or life stories. What happens to them after we deliver them ashore is not in our hands … I wish I knew more. Even if they make it to Germany or Sweden or wherever they want to go, I'm quite sure that many will grow up with a phobia of the sea, or perhaps it just blends into the multitude of horrific experiences they have had and continue to endure. Most are Syrians running from hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally as we start the process of packing for the journey home I find myself staring at my passport. How fortunate I am to have a bit of paper that allows me to fly over these man-made frontiers. An accident of birthplace. I feel privileged to have been the first face of Europe to many and hopefully a friendly one. &lt;/p&gt;

	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

	The countdown to Copenhagen is over and the time for excuses has run out. Next week, more than 100 heads of state will answer your call to come to Copenhagen and take personal responsibility for the future of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/30-nov-2009-kevin-rudd-adver.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We're looking to the future. What about our leaders?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government negotiators will spend the next 10 days laying the groundwork for the heads of state show, which begins next week. Their task is to reach a deal that is fair to all countries, ambitious in emissions cuts and legally binding. All of the pieces are in place to make this happen; success or failure is down to the level of political will the heads of state bring to the table. It's now up to the leaders to decide if we get a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the negotiations start, we will all watch to see who will take the lead in the shaping of the new climate treaty. In recent weeks, many of the larger developing countries have put new commitments on the table, and both India and China have pledged to reduce the carbon intensity linked to their economic growth. Rich nations, however, are still shirking  responsibility for their historical contribution to climate change or the greater resources they have available to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the US has offered a paltry 4 percent emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020, when the science calls for at least 40 percent by then. However, it's not all bad news, South Africa has emerged as a frontrunner in the 'COP15 conference star' stakes by announcing emissions reductions targets of 34% below business as usual over the next 10 years, and 42 percent by 2025 - a step up from their previous target. This directly challenges all industrialised countries to step it up and commit to ambitious targets needed to slow climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24945/kumi-naidoo-chair-of-tcktcktc-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million of you have called for our leaders to sign a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement. TckTckTck's petition was handed over to key figures at the climate talks today: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and COP 15 President and Danish Climate Minster Connie Hedegaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TckTckTck chair and Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the size of the petition demonstrated the huge groundswell of support for world leaders to deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Here are the four critical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from industrialised countries must be cut by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financing from industrialised countries to the tune of $140 billion a year for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of tropical deforestation by 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30% by 2020, again with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The road to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN climate summit is the culmination of a two-year negotiating process that began in Bali, Since then, the talks have been repeatedly stalled by a complete lack of ambition by the US, first under President Bush and then by President Obama's inability to lead on the climate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The crunch issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to progress in Copenhagen is resolution and agreement on the crunch issues -- those key elements that will put the world on a path to staying as far below a 2 degree C temperature as possible. That is what the science demands and what is required to ensure the survival of the world's most vulnerable countries and people and, ultimately, all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science says we must, technology says we can, it is time for politicians to say we will.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Barack to the future? Obama confuses key climate dates </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/emission-targets-us-china-021209/</url><text>
	As Barack Obama announced the US position for the Climate talks in Copenhagen, we felt a bit of an anti-climax between the buzz and the actual numbers. Maybe a time portal opened and Obama is living in an alternate reality? 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/acitivists-make-sure-president.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama first went to Copenhagen to support Chicago for the Olympics. How about going for a win this time around?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China leading, the US lagging - that's not quite the impression spin doctors from the White House were hoping to give when they finally released their numbers on emission reduction. Who is saying "Yes we can" now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of baselines and shallow commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin doctors were hard at work after the announcement - presenting this as a game changer. If you listened only to the White House, you could easily believe that Obama single-handedly saved the climate while everyone else stood around on the sidelines. The truth is, these are the numbers of the Waxman-Markey bill, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/strongmessage"&gt;which is not and has never been enough&lt;/a&gt; to really combat the devastating effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US keeps hiding behind weak numbers, made to appear stronger by shifting the "baseline" date to which they're compared. A reduction of 17 percent of 2005 levels is really a reduction of four or five percent of 1990 levels, the base year all other developed countries are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using 2005 as a base year is the kind of cheap math trick we expect from the Bush administration, not from a President who was elected promising he was going to get us out of the climate crisis. Moving the goal posts to pretend you're scoring is a nice way to spin your speeches, but science doesn't work that way. We can't change the science - we have to change the politics, which is not the way Obama is going right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep global temperature increases below two degrees, developed countries have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from the base year 1990. Anything less, and we face catastrophic climate change. The target of 40 percent emission reduction on a baseline of 1990 for industrialised countries is taken from the International Panel on Climate Change's scenario. This is not a political target, it is the minimum needed to keep the global average temperature at a safe level. You can't negotiate with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good efforts, but try harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, China, part of the group of developing country (the ones the Obama administration keeps insisting they're waiting for) offered targets that actually mean something to avoid catastrophic climate change - a reduction of carbon emissions relative to economic growth by 40 to 45 percent by 2020 also with a base year of 2005, though &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/news/china-carbon-intensity"&gt; those numbers are still not enough&lt;/a&gt;. "Given the urgency and magnitude of the climate change crisis, China needs stronger measures to tackle climate change," said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace China. "This is a significant announcement at a very important point in time. But China could do more."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By taking on a 40-45 percent carbon intensity target, China will have to take considerable efforts to decouple its economic growth from the increase in its carbon emissions. However, given the urgency of climate change, this target is not likely to accelerate China's clean energy revolution as quickly as it should be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barack to the future &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major announcement was made last week: &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/president_obama_will_go_to_cop.html"&gt; Barack Obama is planning on attending the Copenhagen summit... on December 9th&lt;/a&gt;. Last time he &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-shows-up-in-copenhagen021009/"&gt; showed up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, it was also a bit early, but as he is getting closer to the right date, we're keeping our fingers crossed for third time lucky. Otherwise we might start to worry about a possible break in the space-time continuum which could explain why Obama seems to be confusing 2005 with 1990, December 9th with December 17th and Washington, DC with Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Royal State dinner is organised in Copenhagen on the 17th, and it'd be such a shame for Obama to miss it.  Many heads of State have announced they will come already, and it hardly makes sense for Obama to miss the party. The last one to announce his presence was Silvio Berlusconi, adding to the long list of heads of state who have proved they take the threat of climate change remotely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wanted: Climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this, it appears that the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/our_work/guide-to-climate-politics/"&gt; climate leaders are not where you expect them to be&lt;/a&gt;. Obama, who had brought hope last year, is bringing nothing but disappointment in matters climatic. In the developed countries group, the EU has the best position, but it's still not enough. To find anyone leading the way, we have to look towards developing countries like Brazil, China, India, South Africa or Indonesia - or even better, towards the Maldives, the only country so far to pledge to go truly carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in the Obama camp now. Time to rise up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message with your Facebook profile picture or other image of your choice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Our independence is our most expensive principle. We take no money from governments or corporations. Our funding base is people-powered.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Facebook update: Switch to renewable energy now</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/facebook-dump-coal190210/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greening Facebook from within&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Facebook recently announced it will build a massive data centre in Oregon, U.S., packed full of the latest energy efficient computers to serve the hundreds of millions of friends connecting on their near-addictive social networking website. But the company plans to run the place on electricity made by burning coal--Yes, the dirtiest source of energy and largest single source of global warming pollution in the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Facebook.com shouldn't run on coal. Facebook should commit to renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should be run on 100 percent renewable energy. That clear demand started spreading &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coalfacebook"&gt;on the social network&lt;/a&gt; website this week, and will grow until the company announces a decision to really go green. The new data centre won't be ready until 2011, and people power has moved the company before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Facebook members have spoken strongly in the past on privacy and other changes that impact their profile pages, the company has been forced to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping coal from powering your profile page, big electricity consumers like Facebook can also play an important role by using its influence to demand policies that dramatically increase the supply of renewable electricity being put on the grid, so we can all use renewable energy--and not coal--to power the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook's relationship to coal: "It's not complicated"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PacifiCorp is the power company which Facebook chose to supply their new US$ 180 million data centre in Prineville, Oregon. &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.pacificorp.com/es/thermal.html" target="_new"&gt;PacifiCorp's website&lt;/a&gt;, over 83 percent of the utility's generation capabilities come from coal, geothermal, and natural gas resources.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; Pacific Power, whose parent company is PacifiCorp, gets almost 60 percent of its energy from burning coal.  Facebook also went to a state, Oregon, with only one existing in-state coal plant (that's shutting down within the decade) and instead decided to throw its lot with a utility that imports dirty coal from Wyoming, two states over.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Facebook says that the new building and all the technology within it will be state of the art, energy efficient stuff. Saving energy makes good business sense, and it's good for the environment too. But data centres still consume massive amounts of energy to run computers, backup power, and related cooling equipment. If Facebook's data centre runs on fossil fuels, then it's contributing to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook should commit to stop using coal and choose renewable power for all its servers as soon as possible. What's more, to be a climate leader Facebook should also push for strong clean energy and climate policies in the U.S. and globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which side are you on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data centres are heavy users of electricity. It's been a while since Facebook was run on a small computer in a Harvard University dorm. As the popularity of facebook.com continues to grow, so too will Facebook's need for more data centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies who run their data centres on energy from burning coal are supporting &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/"&gt; the biggest source of man made CO2 emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Our activists will continue to protest against coal-fired power plants. But getting companies like Facebook to switch to renewables is necessary for the energy revolution too -- reducing demand for coal, and investing in a green future instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	Our activists at the Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia have had an tough time lately. Many of them have been arrested, interrogated and deported - along with independent journalists.

            Climate polluter gets suspended on the Kampar Peninsula 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point police even tried to shut down the entire camp. Yet thanks to local support, our camp continues, in the heart of the rainforest, with the spirit and resolve of those remaining now stronger than ever as we celebrate a first positive step resulting from our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Ministry of Forestry has suspended the operation of Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL) on the Kampar Peninsula- pending an investigation into their permits. &lt;a id="lg:w" title="This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;This is the pulp and paper giant that our activists shutdown earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. And as local authorities do their best to silence us we're witnessing adramatic growth in both local and international support to protect forests for the climate in Indonesia - and across the globe &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/18/AR2009111804162_2.html?sid=ST2009111804211"&gt; Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CA8QFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F93fbcc6e-d467-11de-a935-00144feabdc0.html&amp;amp;ei=r1kFS5TiKt6TjAeTtJC8Cw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEPQqb_lclJBLo0Nj5JTKdlEisBCg&amp;amp;sig2=mpO8ZC6yVXD5KWueKZpWyQ"&gt; Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1940544,00.html"&gt; TIME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/11/indonesia-deports-palm-oil-activists-journalists.php"&gt; Treehugger&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct action to defend the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="nbz_" title="50 brave activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula" href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt;50 activists shut down APRIL's operations on the Kampar Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; - and as a result many were arrested, intensively interrogated and 11 foreigners were deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the Indonesian police gave the camp an eviction order. After a 24 hour reprieve, secured by our team on the ground, 300 members of the local community arrived at the camp to show us their overwhelming support - forcing the Chief of Police to reverse his decision to close us down. &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/11/here_is_an_update_from.html"&gt; Our Deputy Program Director, Sarah Burton, was at the camp&lt;/a&gt; to express our global commitment to stop deforestation and thank the local community members for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the police have arrested, detained and deported two more campaigners from Italy and Belgium and two journalists who were on their way to the camp with us from India and Italy. But the local community have demonstrated their support once again and our camp remains active thanks to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;National support culminates in Jakarta rally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a id="me-q" title="more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/en/news/callsby-climateaction"&gt;more than 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters from several of Java's main cities rallied in support of President Yudhoyono's international commitment to reduce carbon emissions from Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. They unfolded a banner reading, "Stop talking, start acting - save the forests for our future".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Pittsburgh G20 Summit earlier this year, President Yudhoyono made an international commitment to a 41 percent reduction in carbon emissions if this was supported with international money. This commitment also needs to be matched by developed countries making deep emissions cuts at home. And they need to support forested countries like Indonesia by committing to a fund to protect tropical forests. &lt;a id="v2kc" title="Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Click here to read more about our Forests for Climate solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Worldwide support for forest protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the detainment and deportation of our Italian campaigner and an independent Italian journalist, Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs put out its strongest ever statement on the importance of tackling forest destruction, responsible for about a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions. That led to Italian supermarket chain, the Co-Op, writing toits suppliers demanding that they stop any dealings with companies linked to Indonesian rainforest destruction. Meanwhile - &lt;a href="http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/09_novembre_20/greenpeace_oranghi_berlusconi-1602036849795.shtml"&gt; in Rome an orangutan family of climate refugees sent a message to President Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; asking him to "Cut CO2 not forests". Back in Indonesia, our team unfurled a banner in a deforested area in Indonesia to send the same message to the President from the frontline of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.ch/index.php?id=1335"&gt;Switzerland - homeless orang-utans stole the show outside key Government ministries&lt;/a&gt;in the capital - they camped out in trees outside government buildings all night to bring the issue to the attention of the Swiss Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, was urged to seek a strong agreement in Copenhagen next month as wishes were placed in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeace_nederland/sets/72157622710110113/show/"&gt; thousands of shoes which were positioned in The Hague's center square by Dutch Greenpeace volunteers&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, children throughout The Netherlands leave shoes out for Sinterklaas (The Dutch version of Santa Claus) and expect something in return. This year - we're asking for a good deal in Copenhagen, including a forest fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;All roads lead to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, making it one of the roots of the climate crisis. We will only avert this crisis if Obama, Merkel, Sarkozy, Brown and other world leaders commit to much deeper cuts in emissions from fossil fuels and to provide the critical funds needed so that countries like Indonesia can end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they fail, we will face mass extinctions, floods, droughts and famine before the end of the century. The climate deal is expected to include a new scheme to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), which will provide the funds needed for nations such as Brazil and Indonesia to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a million hectares of forest, mostly tropical rainforest, are destroyed every month - that is an area of forest the size of a football pitch every two seconds. Indonesia has become the world's third largest climate polluter, after China and the US, since it emits such huge quantities of CO2 - mostly from forest and peatland destruction. The peatland forest on the Kampar Peninsula forms part of one of the largest natural carbon "sinks" in the world and is home to rare species including orangutan and the Sumatran tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up our Climate Defenders Camp in Indonesia last month to bring urgent attention to the role that rainforest and peatland destruction play in driving dangerous climate change in the run-up to the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) and its main rival APRIL are key drivers of rainforest and peatland destruction on the Kampar Peninsula. We hope the Indonesian authorities stop intimidating peaceful protestors who are trying to help President Yudhoyono fulfill the commitment he has made to cut Indonesia's massive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions - and instead continue to investigate companies like APRIL that are destroying the forest and driving global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

	Industries pumping out poisonous substances day after day into rivers that entire communities rely on for their basic water needs - the reality of water pollution in China is one of the country's biggest tragedies. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/outflow-pipe-in-pearl-river-de.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/2/outflow-pipe-in-pearl-river-de.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace campaigner takes a waste water sample directly from the outflow pipe of the Qingyuan Top Dragon Textile company.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context even a seemingly small step by the Government to blacklist 20 factories in the Guangdong province for failing to meet water discharge standards, is of great significance. Three of the factories on the blacklist were amongst those found to be releasing hazardous chemicals as part of their wastewater discharge in our &lt;a title="poisoning the pearl" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Greenpeace collected and analysed samples of wastewater discharges and sediments from five industrial sites located throughout the Guangdong province that has the Pearl River running through it and is known as the "world's factory floor", accounting for nearly 30 percent of China's exports in 2007. The subsequent results of the sampling and analysis were released in a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/hazardous-chemical-pollution-o/"&gt; scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Warning for blacklisted companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the five factories that we sampled, three have been put on the government blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true extent of this pollution is still an unknown. A problem further exacerbated by inadequate water pollution regulation, allowing factories to discharge wastewaters containing complex cocktails of chemicals capable of causing serious damage to China's rivers and the life in and around them. Detailed report on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-report-2"&gt; Poisoning the Pearl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being blacklisted means greater scrutiny on these companies and their industrial discharges which could in the future translate to deadlines by the government for the companies to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/water/"&gt; stop polluting the Pearl River Delta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a warning to the factories and it may also affect the company's financial status in terms of ability to launch a stock market listing or apply for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;We welcome the decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government started publishing these lists in 2006 and the important thing to notice is that factories previously blacklisted have improved their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome both the list and the fact that three of the companies we highlighted to the government last year have been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those three companies are Qingyuan Top Dragon, Wing Fung P.C. Board, and Techwise Qingyuan Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;However a final note of caution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since China's pollution regulations focus largely on conventional pollutants and not toxic chemicals, Greenpeace is urging the government to urgently rework this legislation. The blacklisting is a positive first step, but to seriously combat pollution that causes cancer and sickness, China needs to start monitoring and eliminating hazardous chemical discharges into its rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Dr Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 12th, 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister Hatoyama,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your election has presented Japan with a-once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change. Internationally, your support for ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions has challenged the world to put our climate before corporate profits, the stance of a true leader. At home, your election commitment to build a strong economy and end corruption within the government has given you much support with the people of Japan, but also presents a hard road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us came to our new roles around the same time last year and I believe we have much common ground on which to build a new relationship between government and non-government organisations in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Greenpeace I worked for many years to end corruption in my home country of South Africa, to end poverty worldwide and to ensure that all human rights are respected. When our voices were in the minority, change was hard won. I can imagine that you must have felt the same, fighting to change the political landscape of a generation.  It is an incredible achievement to have turned the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accepted the role of International Executive Director at Greenpeace, because I believe that ensuring a green and peaceful planet is also a basic human right. For both of us, it is not enough to say we want change, we must ensure it happens and now we are both in a position to do so.  Turning the tide is not enough, a new  course must also be set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has operated in Japan for twenty years. In that time our actions stopped the dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan; we have worked with local communities to stop the expansion of US airbases that risked the habitat of the threatened dugong; developed long term working relationships with the technology industry in Japan to remove dangerous substances from products such as mobile phones and computers. We have contributed to government debates to ensure that corporations promoting genetically engineered food do not gain a foothold in Japan and we have not only raised concerns and debate about the nuclear threat in Japan, but assisted in monitoring for radiation following the 2007 fire at the Kashiwazaki nuclear reactor, after a major earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long, positive, peaceful history in your country. However, as a new member of Greenpeace, I can say that I suspect all we are recognised for is our opposition to whaling. Greenpeace in Japan and the Liberal Democratic Party have been at loggerheads on this one issue for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 15th in Aomori, the trial begins of Greenpeace Japan's senior executive Junichi Sato and his colleague Toru Suzuki, following their exposure of large scale corruption within the government whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has garnered a large amount of international attention and condemnation. More than a quarter of a million people sent emails requesting that the government investigate the allegations of corruption and not prosecute the activists. Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams have also signed on to a letter calling on Japan to adhere to strict international standards on human rights. Many international organisations including Transparency International and Amnesty International registered their concern about the manner of detention and prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, just last week, Greenpeace received notification that the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that, in pursuing the detention and prosecution of Junichi and Toru, the previous Administration in Japan had breached numerous articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are decisions made not on your watch. The many years of claim and counter claim were with another party. The United Nations ruling was against the decisions of the previous Administration. You were swept to power on a wave of hope because the people of Japan were tired of corruption. I believe in the same way that you have shown strength in challenging other governments to reach further in the climate negotiations, that you will also take the lead in showing other governments that the civil and political rights of its citizens are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is watching this trial, I urge you to show that it will both be fair and conducted in full accordance with you international obligations to protecting human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are rights that I have held in my heart since I was a child growing up in South Africa under Apartheid, and ones that I will always strive for, but in my new life at Greenpeace there is an equally compelling need to act to stop climate change and I believe we can also work together to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the biggest threat our planet and people face and demands immediate, dramatic action. I know that Japan can go even further if other nations will make similarly strong commitments and I welcome the chance to discuss how we can face this challenge together, and in particular exchange opinion on how Japan can continue to take a leadership role regarding climate finance. I also know that nuclear is not the answer - we have only to look at the dangers of the technology, the needless expense and most tangibly, the radiation leaks at Kashiwazaki after the earthquake to know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are solutions. Greenpeace has already mapped out and had accepted by scientists a plan for an Energy [R]evolution which outlines a global plan for a sustainable renewable economic future. It shows us how we can get from where we are now, to where we need to be to avoid a climate change disaster. It was developed with specialists from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Centre and more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that together we can forge a new relationship in Japan. That you will ensure human rights are respected and the environment protected and it is my strongest hope that the opportunities presented to both of us will be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/08be9eab86664205b6c2569cb5b36d0a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join Kumi. Tell the Japanese government that you stand beside Junichi and Toru.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>GUILTY! Japan's justice system "breached human rights of Greenpeace anti-whaling activists"</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/japan-guilty-whaling080210/</url><text>
	When two of our activists were detained after exposing major corruption in the Japanese whaling industry -- we knew the Japanese authorities breached internationally guaranteed human rights. Now, as these two activists prepare to take the stand and have their day, or more in court, the violation of their human rights has been confirmed by a UN working group.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/greenpeace-heeft-geprotesteerd.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/greenpeace-heeft-geprotesteerd.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Over 300,000 people have demanded justice for the Tokyo Two. Have you?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/meet-the-tokyo-two/"&gt;"Tokyo Two"&lt;/a&gt;, are due to stand trial on February 15th -- charged for theft and trespass. But over the past two years it has become clear that &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/timeline/"&gt;much more is now under the legal spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. Corrupt government practices, censoring public information, Japan'sadherence to international law, freedom of speech and the right ofindividual protest together with the commercial killing of thousands of whales are all under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before the verdict has evenbeen rendered, a working group of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has already ruled that, in the defendants' attempts to expose a scandal in the public interest, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two/wgad-opinion"&gt;their human rights have been breached by the Japanese justice system&lt;/a&gt;. The Working Group's opinion is the first of its kind for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/End-whaling-NOW/"&gt;Take Action: Stand beside Junichi and Toru as co-defendants and show theJapanese government that it cannot silence the opposition to whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; February 12th, Nobel Peace Prize winners Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Betty Williams, along with several top celebrties, have added their support for Junichi and Toru. And our Executive Director Kumi Naidoo has written &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt;an open letter to Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Box green"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/the-japanese-whaling-ship-niss.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="151"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Junichi and Toru exposed a scandal involving government corruption entrenched within the tax-payer funded whaling industry. Their findings included the embezzlement of whale meat. The Tokyo District Prosecutor began an investigation but then shut it down the same day that &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/activists-arrested-200608/"&gt;Junichi and Toru were arrested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were held for 26 days, 23 of them without charge - often tied to chairs while they were interrogated, without a lawyer present. They face up to ten years in jail for doing what any honorable citizen should do -- expose corruption. But it is not just Junichi and Toru's liberty that is at stake here -- it is the fundamental right to peacefully investigate and expose corruption, to challenge authority and to do so without fear of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their initial arrest in June 2008, more than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition to demand justice for the Tokyo Two, and legal experts including Supreme Court advocates worldwide have expressed concern about the prosecution. &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/tokyo-two-statement-of-concer/"&gt;International human rights and advocacy groups such as Amnesty International have questioned the legitimacy of the prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A hugely significant UN ruling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNHRC's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention informed the Japanese government in December that its treatment of Junichi and Toru breached no fewer than five articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The working group also recognised the following facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Sato and Suzuki acted considering that their actions were in the greater public interest as they sought to expose criminal embezzlement within the taxpayer-funded whaling industry."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Junichi and Toru willingly cooperated with the police and the Public Prosecutor but that this cooperation was not acknowledged."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The Government did not submit any essential information, such as details of Junichi ans Toru's activities as environmental activists, the investigation they carried out, the evidence they gathered or the help they gave to authorities to formally investigate their allegations."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time anyone has been found to be arbitrarily detained in Japan, so even before it has officially begun this case has become a landmark," said Dr Naidoo. "Prime Minister Hatoyama's government has shown itself to be a leader when it comes to climate change, now it is time for it to show its commitment to human rightsand ensure this case is remembered as a progressive turning point for justice in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;--&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/open-letter-hatoyama120210/"&gt; Open letter to Prime Minister Hatoyama&lt;/a&gt; from Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr. Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Working Group concluded: "The right of these two environmental activists not to be arbitrarily deprived of their liberty; their rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to exercise legitimate activities, as well as their right to engage in peaceful activities without intimidation or harassment has not been respected by the Justice system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the Working Group found that the government has contravened articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also took the view that Sato and Suzuki had been denied the right to challenge their detention before an independent and impartial tribunal in fair proceedings, and requested that the remainder of the trial be conducted fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24926/greenpeace-staff-junichi-sato.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="244"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was made by the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedy the shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will be fair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it should re-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt;the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen he stood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Now he has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, by ensuring that corruption is put on trial -- rather than the honourable men who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

	Since December there has been a glut of stories challenging the science of climate change as represented by the IPCC. Should we be concerned? Only about climate change.
&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Arctic sea ice: still melting. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately there's been a rash of stories all ending with the word "gate" and all questioning the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the IPCC. Here's our handy guide to the truth behind the gates, but first -- why are they all called 'gate' anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Watergate" scandal of the early 1970s brought down US President Nixon, and was so named because it began with a break-in at the Watergate Hotel, Washington DC. After Nixon's resignation the conservative columnist and former Nixon speechwriter William Safire began attaching the word ''gate'' to all kinds of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactic worked, and pretty soon you could make anything sound like a scandal by adding the word "gate". Why did he do it? Partly to make his former boss's crimes look less serious and partly to make the small stories he was writing about look bigger than they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what's been going on in the last two months. The recipe is simple. Take a small story, add the word "gate", a dash of alarmism, and pinch of exaggeration and voila, instant scandal. Oh, and repeat as frequently as you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the breakdown on what's been happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Hackergate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate began with the release onto the internet of around one thousand e-mails and three thousand documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, home to some well respected climate scientists. With a thousand e-mails to choose from, a handful of sentences were selected to try and make the case that something dodgy was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video spells out quite nicely how much substance there was to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; 
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nnVQ2fROOg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;
&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nnVQ2fROOg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Himalayagate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackergate was followed by Himalayagate. In its Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, the IPCC reported that Himalayan Glaciers could be gone as soon as 2035. That claim turned out to be incorrect, and not to have been based on a scientific study. The IPCC subsequently withdrew the claim, it was an error, not a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean the glaciers aren't retreating, just that the rate of retreat isn't as high as the IPCC stated. On the graph below from the World Glacier Monitoring Service the red bars are years where, on average, the world's glaciers shrank, blue are years where they grew. Are the world's glaciers in trouble? It's an easy question. Is there more red or blue on the graph below?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/sum08.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24928/graph-showing-the-mean-annual.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Amazongate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Himalayagate we had Amazongate. Here the charge was that the footnote to the claim that 40% of the Amazon could die off was wrong. Not that the claim was wrong, just that the footnote was wrong. And it was. The report  the footnote pointed to didn't back up the claim directly itself. But  another scientific paper did [1]. Since then two more papers [2, 3] have confirmed the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's bad footnoting, but it's not bad science, and that's all there was to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;The Mini Ice Age Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Northern Europe, or North East America you've had a cold start to 2010. And since that's where a lot of journalists live several of them have taken the opportunity to join up the collection of 'gates' with the cold weather to claim that there's a mini ice age coming. If that sounds a little hysterical to you, well, you'd be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story didn't really run in Australia though, because they're suffering from near record high summer temperatures. The West coast of Canada didn't pick it up either, because things are so warm that they're having to move snow by hand to make sure the Winter Olympics can go ahead as planned. Meanwhile in the high Arctic the weather seems warmer than usual. Indeed, it's the warm Arctic that's causing the current cold weather in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most newspapers provide their journalists with access to the internet. Why so few of them used it when compiling their 'mini ice age' stories is something we may never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;So what drives this debate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From reading the mainstream media, you might think there's a battle of opinion going on in the scientific community. Nothing could be further from the truth. The scientific consensus represented by the IPCC's reports is robust. Scientists who are sceptical about 'anthropogenic global warming' (AGW) are so thin on the ground, for instance, that the BBC's environmental analyst, Roger Harrabin, &lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/02/03/bbc-asks-wuwt-for-help/#more-15999"&gt; e-mailed a climate-denier blog&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February, for help in finding one! He wrote, "I am trying to talk to UK scientists in current academic posts who are sceptical about AGW. I'm struggling to find anyone..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inaccurate claim recently going around was that the IPCC's conclusion that coral reef degradation is linked to climate change was solely based on a report by Greenpeace. In fact, the IPCC's findings are solidly underpinned by peer-reviewed science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recurring story over the past 20 years of the IPCC. Attacks against the IPCC have originated from hired guns of the fossil fuel industry or disgruntled individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What this means for the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPCC scientific assessment is a rigorous and robust process, probably the biggest ever organised scientific endeavour, with thousands of scientists in many different research institutes around the world, backed up with masses of data. It is also a human endeavour and therefore not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment report in question is 3,000 pages long, and so far two years of effort by the world's denialists and journalists have found, well, one bad footnote. The story about the Himalayas was pointed out by a scientist - just the way it was supposed to be, and since we, like many others, relied on the IPCC report and repeated it we're now correcting it across our websites. If you spot any examples we've missed, &lt;a href="/international/en/about/contactus/"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has, and continues to have confidence in the IPCC. There is no more reliable guide to the world's climate science than the IPCC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7014203.ece"&gt; reported in the Times&lt;/a&gt; that the Executive Director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, has called for the resignation of the IPCC chair, Dr Rejendra Pachauri. His comments were taken from a much longer conversation with the Times journalist at a reception and do not reflect the full conversation. Greenpeace is not calling for Pachuari to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is clear, climate change is real, is happening now, and is caused by people. The solution is still in our hands, with clean energy, smart use of our power, and forest protection. If you want to be part of that solution, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/changethefuture/"&gt; become a climate defender today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Toxics Action Delivering E-Waste to Wipro 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of India's relatively small PC manufacturing companies, &lt;a href="http://www.wipro.com/corporate/media/newsdetail.aspx?id=1562" target="_blank"&gt;Wipro, has beaten giants like Dell, Samsung and Lenovo to the finish line&lt;/a&gt; in producing a computer free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major first in India, the announcement marks another success for our green electronics campaign in driving tech companies around the world to clean up their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new computer, named "Greenware" is free of both hazardous PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and BFRs (brominated flame retardants). This meets a long-time demand of Greenpeace. Since 2005, we have been encouraging a greener electronics race by ranking company performance. Wipro joins companies like &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Apple, HP and Nokia who are leading the way on eliminating toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.  Years of pressure from Greenpeace, and attention to our ranking from green consumers, are driving more and more companies to clean up their act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 is the year many electronics companies pledged to remove toxic chemicals like PVC and BFRs. Those that took this pledge seriously are now delivering. Other companies that are far bigger than Wipro in the global market -- such as Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung -- are failing to come up with the green goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our latest ranking, Samsung lost points for failing to give a clear timeline for removing toxic chemicals, as did Dell and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;E-waste in Asia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste are exposed to significant health risks, as are nearby communities. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources can form dangerous dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic waste is a particular concern in Asia, as a lot of the waste produced in developed countries ends up there for crude recycling, though a better word for it would probably be "dumping." Poor regulations and control enable a traffic that is essentially illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste exposes unprotected workers, many of them children, to toxic chemicals. It is time for all tech companies to follow the example set by Wipro and other leaders and produce electronics free of the worst toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s been almost two years since the wrongful arrest of Junichi and Toru for their roles in exposing the corruption and lies woven in the fabric that holds the whaling industry together. As the trial for those charges began, it seemed obvious to all in attendance that the case the prosecution put together is cut from the same cloth.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Tokyo Two on the opening day of the trial where whaling will also be judged in Aomori, Japan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial opened up with the prosecution struggling to prove its own arguments and their witnesses being forced to agree with the defence on key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Japan maintains that whaling is conducted as "scientific research" and paid for with Japanese taxes, the everyday business of killing and processing whales falls to one commercial company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness from this company and from the courier company used to ferry the embezzled meat around the country  were in court to testify about what it looks like when whale meat and money change hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the story seemed to change quite a bit from original claims, one thing was for sure - it had nothing to do with research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not so "official" business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of sales for Kyodo Senpaku - the company contracted by the government's Institute for Cetacean Research, to run the whaling fleet - admitted under cross examination that "souvenirs" of whale meat were given to crew, but the cost was never accounted for in financial statements, despite the whaling programme being a government funded project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same official that previously made public statements where he insisted that there was no practice of giving out souvenir meat. He also admitted under oath that following the Greenpeace allegations in 2008, souvenirs are no longer given to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prosecution also called the manager of the Seino Transport courier company, which shipped the boxes of embezzled whale meat around Japan in April 2008 after the fleet returned from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. In his testimony he confirmed that he had paid the owner of the box about 30,000 yen (US$300) out of his own pocket, and never registered this payment. He also admitted that the owner had told him the box contained food and not the "cardboard" listed on the contents sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to engage in this politically motivated prosecution was madeby the previous government in Japan. The new administration can remedythe shame of this damning UN opinion by ensuring that the trial will befair, adhering to international legal standards. Further, it shouldre-examine &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier/"&gt; the original allegations made by Junichi and Toru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama has already shown leadership. In Copenhagen hestood out with his support for ambitious action on climate change. Nowhe has the opportunity to be seen as a world leader in human rights, byensuring that corruption is put on trial - rather than the honourablemen who exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;

Their mission: To cut through the greenwash, and highlight product ranges on the market which really are free of hazardous chemicals like PVC (vinyl) plastic and brominated flame retardants (BFR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CES is a major trade show where electronics companies come to demonstrate new products and jostle for industry media attention (which these days includes many technology blogs like &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;). Though it is not open to the public, CES say they expect over 140,000 attendees -- that's a lot of consumer electronics industry people in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

Any company failing to achieve this goal is taking a big gamble with its green reputation. On a positive note, it's good to see non-ranked companies beyond the PC and TV sectors, like Cisco, committing to eliminate these harmful &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/dell-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and LG Electronics (&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-14"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;pick up penalty points in the Guide&lt;/a&gt; for failing to follow through on a promised phase-out of toxics in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies in our ranking guide had pledged to remove &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/" target="_blank"&gt;toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic and BFRs&lt;/a&gt; from their product range by the end of 2009, which would have meant a greater show of greener, toxic-free products for visitors to see at the CES. But, for now, it's a no show for these companies, who have delayed their phase-out to 2011 or beyond. No doubt they won't mention their backtracking to journalists and bloggers they meet at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's all the concern about toxic chemicals and e-waste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC contaminates humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle; during its production, use, and disposal it is the single most environmentally damaging of all plastics, and can form dioxin, a known carcinogen, when burned. Some BFRs are highly resistant to degradation in the environment and are able to build up in animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the growth of electronic waste, workers who deal with e-waste and the wider community are exposed to significant health risks. Burning of e-waste to recover valuable resources, as routinely takes place in the backyards of China, India and much of the global South, can form dioxins. Eliminating the substances will decrease exposure and increase the recyclability and reusability of electronic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumers want green, not greenwash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronics companies have been moving their "environmental information" links higher and higher on product information webpages in the four years since our first &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/rankingguide" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Green Electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is only greenwash though, and &lt;a href="~/link/3d5ecf03f1544b4197a46b69f9a9e57b.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; informed consumers can tell the difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/news/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple cleared the final hurdle&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating toxic PVC (vinyl) plastic, making it the first company to completely eliminate hazardous BFRs and PVC in its computer systems. Pressure from thousands of Apple lovers and advocates turned thecompany green in the time it took to go from iMac G5 (2006) to iMac Aluminum (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's time for a little less conversation and a lot more action on removing toxic chemicals." That's what our electronics campaigner, CaseyHarrell, is saying at CES. Apple, Sony Ericsson and Nokia are winning this game and HP is catching up, but the lack of action from other companies is ensuring that customers and the environment are still losing out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ban the toxic stuff for good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies see their scores reduced in this edition of the Guide with the bar being raised on hazardous substances. Having endorsed the precautionary principle, companies now need to actively support bans on PVC, BFRs and chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs) during the revision of the European Union's &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electronics Directive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Companies need to support legislative bans to ensure a consistent phase out of PVC and BFRs across all electronic products," said Iza Kruszewska Greenpeace International toxics campaigner. "Sony Ericsson and Apple are already calling on EU institutions to support such a ban. Other big players like HP and Dell, who have remained silent so far, and Acer need to ensure the ban is passed in the European Union parliament."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia leads the ranking, with a score of 7.3 out of 10. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; follows closely, and is the only company to score full marks on all the toxic chemicals criteria. In third place is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/toshiba-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, but it risks losing points if it fails to meet its commitment to market new models of all its consumer electronics products that are free of PVC and BFRs by 1 April 2010. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; comes in fourth place, while Apple rises from ninth place to fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nintendo-guide-to-greener-electronics-14/"&gt; Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; continues to languish at the bottom of theranking. Sony is rewarded for its reported 17 percent reduction ingreenhouse gas emissions over the period 2000-2008, with renewableenergy now accounting for 8 percent of the total energy purchasedglobally each year by the company, up from 2.5 percent a year ago. Italso gains for the reported use of 17,000 tons of recycled plasticsannually in various products, representing 10 percent of all plasticsused in the 2008 financial year. Almost 90 percent of this recycledplastic was post-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung twitter petition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung drops dramatically from second place to a tied seventh place for failing to eliminate BFRs in all its products by January 2010. With only its latest models of mobile phones free of toxic substances, it has set January 2011 as the deadline for eliminating them from new models of its notebooks and still has no definitive timeline for removing them from its TVs and household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Samsung's marketing people are touting their wares at CES, we'll be calling them out &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;on twitter with this petition&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;petition @Samsungtweets to follow Apple SonyEricsson and HP, and eliminate harmful chemicals like PVC &lt;a href="http://act.ly/1l1" target="_blank"&gt;http://act.ly/1l1&lt;/a&gt; RT to sign #actly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 04 May 07 - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPCC's Working Group III has released it's 4th Assessment Report detailing options for mitigating climate change.  The IPCC's summary for policy makers is available on their website &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg3-spm-1.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (pdf, 35 pages). Our briefing on the report's key findings is available &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/IPCC-bangkok-outcomes"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; (MS Word, 5 pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update - 30 May 07 -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the opening the meeting this morning Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, Chair of the IPCC, visited the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/solargen/"&gt;Solar Generation&lt;/a&gt;renewable energy container outside the UN building.  The youngactivists got a chance to talk with him about the potential for aglobal energy revolution to deal with climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studentsfrom Thailand, India, Indonesia, Philippines, China, Germany and Franceare reminding delegates at the meeting that decisions taken now aboutfuture energy supply will determine how much climate chaos futuregenerations are forced to live with.  Read more on the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/solargen/solargen-achievements/solargeneration-challege-gove"&gt; Solar Generation blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What we're saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now stand at a 'climate crossroads'. We can go down the road of renewable energy and smart efficient use of energy, keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change or we can keep blundering on in the same direction into a fossil-fuelled future of extreme weather, drastic water shortages and desperate climate refugees. We cannot afford to take a wrong turn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this while phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear and without the use of unproven 'techno-fixes' like carbon capture and storage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Tara Buakamsri, Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our global energy concept means, that the investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a range of 300-350 billion dollars per year - almost equal to the amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To shift this money and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030, which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- SvenTeske, Greenpeace International climate and energy campaigner about the economic advantages of the energy [r]evolution scenario&lt;/p&gt;

	The first milestone of the Copenhagen Accord came and went, and with it no sign of the kind of targets for cutting global warming pollution needed to steer the world off the path towards catastrophic climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/climate_shame.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists called "Climate Shame" on Heads of State in as they fail to deliver a Real Deal in Copenhagen
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the Copenhagen Accord could possibly be a useful political declaration was if its January 31st deadline had been met with tougher new greenhouse gas emission targets. After all, its stated goal is supposed to be to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But governments tried to greenwash their failure at the UN Copenhagen climate summit by merely repeating existing targets and dressing them up as action. So far, these targets will fail to hold global warming to below 3 degrees C; an increase which threatens to have horrendous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it take for politicians to realise that time is running out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Masks off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious to everyone - even those who tried hard to pretend the world was saved after Copenhagen - that the Accord is a document barely worth the paper it is written on. It was put together quickly by politicians hoping to pass for leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving face - that was its purpose. Our climate was the least of politicians' concerns then, and obviously still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, Bernhard Obermayr, Head of the Climate and Energy Campaign, Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe said, "Today is the day for an obituary about the Copenhagen Accord's ability to protect the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where we stand now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do governments avoid the 2 degree C threshold from being breached?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret. By 2020, industrialised nations must cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels and developing countries need to reduce their projected growth in emissions by 15-30%. Further, the industrialised world needs to provide developing countries with new and additional funding of at least USD 140 billion annually to support clean energy and other mitigation activities, forest protection and adaptation. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; To give this package teeth, it must be set in a legally binding agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to Copenhagen, 15 million people called for a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty. We're still waiting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Associating' - since the Accord is not legally binding and was noted but not adopted by the UN Conference, associated is the best they can do - with the Accord, the European Union repeated its target of a 20 percent emissions cut against 1990 levels - old news, and only half of what is required. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/emission-targets-us-china-021209/"&gt; The US is sticking by the meagre 17 percent of 2005 levels&lt;/a&gt; but making that dependent of domestic legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the absence of leadership by the rich industrialised world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the lowest-lying Pacific island nations last week said it's going to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2020. Lying only 2 meters above sea level, the Marshall Islands is in danger of being washed off the map. In other words, the industrialised world has been shamed for its inaction by one of the most vulnerable nations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting the "dead" in "deadline"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 31st was a political deadline. We are approaching other deadlines though; ones that nature decides on and which politicians will not be able to talk their way out of. If global warming gets to the point where 'tipping points' are passed there will be no way for us to backtrack and undo the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-third-degree/"&gt; While three degrees of warming would likely be catastrophic.&lt;/a&gt; But even 2 degrees C risks possible partial, but irreversible deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet and even the West Antarctic ice sheet, that could eventually lead to sea level rise of several meters. Half-of-one degree more could lead to 20-80% loss of the Amazon rainforest and countless species that live in the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2010/2/climate-impacts.jpg" alt="" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the poorest and those least responsible for causing the problem who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The fight for survival of millions of people around the world and countless species of plants and animals is the brutal reality as permafrost melts, sea levels rise, tropical storms batter continents and once-fertile lands battle with floods or drought. But climate change knows no borders - we will all feel its impacts. It threatens economies, environments, human society and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

	The French nuclear industry seems to think it's fair to ship nuclear waste to Russia and then forget about it. They think that keeping the waste away from the French public will protect their glossy image. Not as long as Greenpeace is around.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists lock on to rails to stop nuclear waste.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night three teams of Greenpeace activists blocked a train transporting nuclear waste to Cherbourg, the heart of the French nuclear reprocessing industry. From Cherbourg it was due to be loaded onto the transport ship Kapitan Kuroptev, destination Russia. We've taken action to tell them that "Russia is not your dumping ground."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the railway, at two locations en route to the fuel reprocessing facility. A third team of Greenpeace activists placed a truck on the rails in the centre of Cherbourg, along with a banner saying "Russia is not a nuclear dumping ground". The train came to a halt just 50 meters short of our activists. For delaying the transport of the illegal nuclear waste they were taken into custody by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocked train was carrying 500 tonnes of depleted uranium, just a fraction of what has already been dumped in Russia. The French nuclear companies AREVA and EDF claim there is nothing wrong with these transports, that the material is not waste but a resource that will be processed in Russia, and returned to France as fuel. Unfortunately that's just not the case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog-s.greenpeace.fr/uploads/2010/01/nuke1.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="261"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, 33,000 tonnes of uranium have been exported to Russia (including 23,540 tonnes of depleted uranium), while only 3090 tonnes of uranium made the opposite trip. 30,000 tonnes of waste has been abandoned in Russia. This is in direct contradiction with both the French law and the European Union directive, which prohibits the export and import of hazardous wastes. If you read French there's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/france/presse/dossiers-documents/rapport-hctisn-france-russie.bin"&gt; a full report on this available here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this behavior sounds familiar, it should. AREVA is an expert in the business of running a dirty business and leaving the waste far away. Whether it's dumping uranium in Siberia or &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2009/11/areva_nuclear_scandal_greenpea.html"&gt; mining uranium in Niger&lt;/a&gt; they've made sure the problems of the nuclear industry are kept well away from France.&lt;/p&gt;

	The world's #1 sportswear brand, Nike, has accepted our Detox challenge: today it has officially committed to eliminating all hazardous chemicals across its entire supply chain, and the entire life-cycle of its products by 2020. This is a major win for our campaign to protect the planet’s precious water, and create a toxic-free future.

&lt;p&gt;Nike's announcement comes just five weeks into our&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/detox"&gt; Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which began when we launched the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;" report, revealing commercial links between major clothing brands - including Nike, Puma and Adidas - and suppliers responsible for releasing hazardous chemicals into Chinese rivers. We challenged these brands to champion a toxic-free future by committing to work with their suppliers and remove these toxic chemicals from their clothes and China's rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nike sets a new pace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma was first&lt;/a&gt; to break away from the pack, opening up an impressive lead by announcing that it would go toxic-free. Puma's commitment to remove all hazardous chemicals from its entire product-portfolio must have left their competition wondering how they were going to raise their game. Now, Nike and Puma are the front-runners, and Adidas is far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike also agreed (&lt;a href="http://www.nikebiz.com/media/pr/2011/08/17_zero_discharge.html" target="_blank"&gt;their full statement&lt;/a&gt;) to address the issue of the public's "right to know" by ensuring full transparency about the chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The more the public knows about the toxic chemicals spilling out of these factories, the more the pressure to stop them polluting will increase. The importance of this cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sportswear giant has also promised to use its influence, knowledge and experience to bring about widespread elimination of hazardous chemicals from the clothing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tonight projected messages including, “Water Pollution Is Not Fair Play” and "The World Needs More Champions. Is Adidas All In?" to the almost 100,000 fans attending the Spanish Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (sponsored by Adidas) at the Nou Camp Stadium, in Barcelona, Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can Adidas top that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to clean up its act, Nike is showing hints of greatness - but we will be closely monitoring the company’s implementation plan, due to be published by 18 October. And just because Nike’s taking the lead shouldn’t mean Adidas or other clothing companies can simply throw in the towel. The game is still on and they should be hot on Nike's heels to become champions of a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas have a lot of ground to make up. If they want to be considered contenders, they need to get in the game by committing to zero discharge and really take the lead by developing a new culture of transparency throughout the clothing industry and helping others stop the release of hazardous chemicals currently used during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's like Green My Apple again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind the Detox campaign comes from a year-long investigation into the textile industry's water pollution problem in China, where vital research helped us to connect the dots and link hazardous chemicals and their impacts in waterways like the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas to textile factories and international clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these brands, one group stood out as the most likely to become champions of a toxic-free future: Leading sports clothing companies like Nike and Adidas. Not only do they like to market themselves as leaders and innovators, they also have the size and influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate the use and release of these hazardous chemicals from the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="366" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkou6xAb6Rw" width="590"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enormous task of changing the toxic practices of an entire industry can be extremely daunting, so we went in search of a potential leader with the will to change itself and the influence to change others. Much as we did during &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;our Green My Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was vital to engage with innovative and proactive industry leaders - the sort of companies who are willing to put their slogans into action and &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that "impossible is nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much encouraging by Greenpeace and Apple aficionados, in March 2009 Apple become the first laptop maker to eliminate toxic poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). For now we have only commitments from Nike and Puma, though they are on the right track and deserve recognition for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then people really started to get involved and the game was well and truly on. Actions from &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/es/noticias/Greenpeace-desafia-a-Adidas-y-Nike-a-liderar-un-futuro-libre-de-toxicos---/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/Nieuws_2011/Reusachtig-actie-T-shirt-aan-hoofdkantoor-Nike/" target="_blank"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/photosvideos/photos/Activistas-de-Greenpeace-cuelgan-los-trapos-sucios-de-Nike-y-Adidas-en-la-plaza-de-Callao-de-Madrid/"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; – including a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/hundreds-strip-to-challenge-nike-and-adidas-t/blog/35853/"&gt;world wide striptease&lt;/a&gt; – made sure the world’s biggest brands couldn’t ignore the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further pressure to perform was piled on by world’s media as the story ran far and wide, from New York to China and Brazil to the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/environmentalists-raise-awareness-with-coordinated-striptease-2326010.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. In Hong Kong&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our exhibit helped bring the message to the street where passers-by took a moment to put their demands for Detox in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people signed our petition to the CEOs of Nike and Adidas, many thousands of people have tweeted and shared the campaign on social networks and blogs, submitted logo designs, or contributed campaign ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Adidas have a tough act to follow, and everybody's watching.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Blair nuclear announcement scuppered</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/blair-nuclear-announcement-scu/</url><text>
	Greenpeace climbers scuppered Tony Blair's nuclear announcement by delaying the UK Prime Minister's planned pro-nuclear speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The British Prime Minister gets a message from Greenpeace: no nukes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace climbers scaled the ceiling above the speaker'spodium holding banners saying 'nuclear - wrong answer' and thendropping down 'radioactive' confetti, preventing Blair from speaking inthe main gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech has been widely promoted by Blair'sspin doctors as being a vehicle for announcing a further energy review- and for Blair to indicate his personal support for more nuclear powerstations being built across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Tindale Director ofGreenpeace UK said, "Today Blair is trying to launch a new nuclear ageand we are here to stop him. Nuclear power is not the answer to climatechange - it's costly, dangerous and a terrorist target."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Justthree years ago Blair conducted the biggest energy review in 60 years -which concluded renewable energy and energy efficiency, not nuclear, isthe way forward. Today's new review is simply a smokescreen for pushinghis new-found enthusiasm for nuclear power. It's like Iraq all overagain Blair makes his mind up then tries to spin his decision to theBritish people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/banners/2005/11/nuclearwronganswer.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real solution to climate change and energysecurity is a mix of efficient, safe and clean energy technologies likewind, wave, and solar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded, "Nuclear power is simply adangerous red herring in this debate. Even if the UK replaced all 23 ofits operating reactors, we would only save 10 percent of our carbonemissions. In contrast the 56 billion pounds of tax-payers money beingused to fund the clean up of the UK's current nuclear sites could buyand install enough wind turbines to meet 20 percent of the UK'selectricity needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Nuclear power: wrong answer to climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclearpower has justifiably had a bad press in recent years. It's expensiveto the point of being uneconomic without massive government subsidies,produces dangerous radioactive wastes, and the consequences of aserious accident or terrorist attack on a nuclear plant could bedevastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry claims that nuclear reactors emit virtually no CO2 at the point of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delvea little deeper though, and the logic of this pro-nuclear argumentbegins to unravel. While it's true that most nuclear reactors do notemit carbon (although some nuclear plants actually do release CO2 gasbecause it is used for cooling), they are a small part of a nuclearfuel chain which most certainly does. The preparation of uranium forthe reactor involves a host of CO2 -emitting processes, including:mining and milling the ore; fuel enrichment and fuel-rod fabrication.Then there's the construction of the power station itself. At the otherend there's reactor decommissioning and the treatment, storage,transport and disposal of nuclear waste. All of this involves CO2emissions, which in some areas - such as fuel enrichment - aresignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this whole life-cycle is taken intoconsideration, the claim that nuclear power is a 'carbon-free'alternative to current fossil-fuelled power stations doesn't stand up.That's one of the reasons that the Kyoto treaty negotiations rejectedcarbon credits for nuclear power plants. The most recent studiesindicate that, for the richest uranium ores, CO2 emissions across thenuclear cycle are about 33 percent that of fossil-fuel plants. So farso good - but the fact is that very little uranium ore is of sufficientquality to produce such a result. Poor grades of ore have a content ofless than 0.02 percent uranium-235 (this is the uranium isotope whichis necessary to sustain the chain reaction in fuel in a nuclear powerplant). As the high grade ores are used up, the industry will becomeincreasingly dependent on lower grade ores - which will mean using moreand more energy to 'enrich' the level of uranium-235 in the fuel to alevel where it can be used in a reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Uranium is not a renewable resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knownuranium reserves will last for roughly 50 years at present consumptionrates, but the 438 plants operating world-wide produce only 16 percentof global requirements. If the world's entire electricity needs were tobe met by nuclear power, then reserves of high-grade uranium ore wouldbe used up within three to four years. Some estimates predict thatusing the remaining poorer ores in nuclear reactors could produce moreCO2 emissions than burning fossil fuels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a seriouslong-term energy source, nuclear power is a non-starter. But it haspowerful vested interests behind it which are sucking up funding thatwould be better spent on renewable solutions and energy conservation.As in the 1950s when the first generation of nuclear plants wereconceived, governments seem mesmerized by the glamour of nuclear power,and blinded to its obvious drawbacks. Any attempt to positionmainstream nuclear production as a solution to climate change would bea massive miscalculation, just at the time when we need to focus allour attention on the real solutions - energy conservation and renewablesources like wind, tidal and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	If you live in a developed country, you’re pretty well insulated from climate change. Shifts in weather patterns, heavier rainfall, gradually rising sea levels and temperature increases – at the moment western society absorbs these changes without us really noticing much difference. But for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, living on the front line of climate change, shifts in the planet’s behaviour are much more obvious.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/1/copy-of-nenet-mother-and-child.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2010/1/copy-of-nenet-mother-and-child.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nenet girl, Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nenet people of the Yamal peninsula are nomadic reindeer herders who live within the Arctic circle on the northern coast of Siberia. In summer they graze their herds on the tundra of the peninsula, and in winter as the ground freezes they move south to milder parts of the Siberian steppes. They use the frozen surface of the landscape to cross the numerous freshwater lakes and marshes of the peninsula, which in summer they catch fish in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things are changing. The Arctic is the most sensitive area of the planet to climate change. While global average temperature has risen by around 0.8 degrees, some parts of Siberia have warmed by as much as 5 or 6. And so the Nenet have noticed the ground is freezing later and later in the year - and in some places, not freezing at all. The reindeer herders have to wait longer and longer before they can move their animals south across frozen ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, on the frontiers of the world, the warming of Siberia is already threatening a way of life that has remained fairly constant for thousands of years. It's not only that the Nenet have to move later in the year - many of the freshwater lakes that dot the landscape are leaking away as the frozen walls of earth that contain the water melt, and collapse. And so the Nenet are also losing the fishing that provides one of their main sources of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/melting-permafrost-in-yamal-pe.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eternal ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siberia is a landscape that's underpinned by frozen ground, called 'permafrost', but this ground is beginning to thaw. Off the coast, whole islands made of permafrost are literally disappearing as the arctic sea washes away the rapidly melting land. Melting permafrost is causing roads, pipelines and foundations to collapse across the country. Every year, there's an increase in the area of ground that melts in summer and the area that doesn't refreeze in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a problem in the Arctic. This melt has global implications, because it's going to speed up climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permafrost is like a giant frozen compost heap - full of dead plants, animals, trees and other carbon-rich organic matter, and in places it reaches 1.5km (one mile) deep. While it stays frozen, that carbon is locked up in the ground. But as the Arctic warms and the permafrost thaws, microbes start to break down that organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9_Qn8UrxuE?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaming lakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - probably causing, tonne for tonne, around 25 times more global warming over a hundred years than carbon dioxide.  By lighting escaping methane, scientists can capture dramatic images of plumes of flame bubbling up through holes cut into Siberian lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are adding more and more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which is accelerating climate change. Permafrost contains massive amounts of carbon - probably about twice what's currently in the atmosphere, and about 5 times more than all the human-caused greenhouse gases we've released. While we don't have a really clear understanding of how much carbon might be released as the permafrost melts, it's fair to say that any extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from melting permafrost are bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24948/copy-of-nenet-girl-yamal-peni.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the melting permafrost, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. And so we need strong political action from world leaders at Copenhagen. We need to control the warming that's leading the Arctic to melt away. It's probably too late to stop climate change ending the Nenet's traditional way of life for good. But if we don't act now, that's going to be the case for pretty much everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

            Naked message: global warming could mean an end to the days of wine... and rosés.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Parental warning: the story below contains nudity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's an open letter to world leaders with a naked truth about climate change: their efforts so far have barely made a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Obama, Merkel, Jintao, Lula, Sarkozy, Zapatero, Tusk etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you willhave no doubt witnessed this year - tens of thousands of people are willing togo to some extraordinary lengths for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are even willing to taketheir clothes off! 700 people havestripped naked in a vineyard to warn the world of the effects climatechange will have on French wine. And a while ago, hundreds of otherswere prepared to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; pose nude on a glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people have made time to march, &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/10000_dance_for_a_climate_deal.html"&gt; dance&lt;/a&gt;, create artwork, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/"&gt; chainthemselves overnight to coal installations in Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; lock on toequipment in Canada's tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, get arrested for &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/danger-g20-climate230909/"&gt; suspending a messageto the G20 from a bridge in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, spend &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/urgent-action-needed-as-arctic/"&gt; four months at sea awayfrom their families to show again that the Arctic is melting&lt;/a&gt;, document&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvnqSvvHDGo"&gt; glacial melt at the top of the Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/countdown-copenhagen-100days280809/"&gt; carved a hundred icestatues in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to show the threat to Asia's water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lengths to which we're all willing to go to call for action on this issue, do you think you could make some time in your busy calendar this December to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; show up in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;? To date, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have said they will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not asking you to take your clothes off in Copenhagen - but &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt; we do expect you to be there - to sign a fair, ambitious and binding deal to save the future of our planet&lt;/a&gt;. A half-decent climate treaty simply wont do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Voila! Stop tar sands en Français</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tar-sands-france091009/</url><text>
	Our tar sands campaign just spread from Canada to France when 30 Greenpeace activists entered Total’s refinery site, in Normandy, to highlight the involvement of the French oil company with the climate-changing tar sands in Alberta. Activists unfurled one banner on a huge tank, and two others on the 75 meter-high chimney stacks of the site's power station. The banners read "climate crime" and "Total invests in sustainable destruction."
&lt;div&gt;

            Total: "Our energy is your mess"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a global problem -- and this action is part of a global response to one of the worst climate offenders.  The world doesn't want Canada's dirty oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian "tourist" was also there participating in this action. Greenpeace activist Eryn Wheatley from Toronto was inside the Total refinery and occupying a large tank. She wanted to take a strong message across the Atlantic to Sarkozy and Europe -- that not all Canadian's support dirty oil, and real climate leaders shouldn't buy or fund tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not Canada's dirty secret anymore," said Eryn, from inside the Total site. "We're here today to expose an international climate crime. Sarkozy and other European leaders can't keep exporting the climate crisis to Canada. We need real leadership at Copenhagen and that means no more tar sands."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Totally criminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total S.A. has already invested more than 8 billion Euros in Alberta, and is planning to invest 10 billion more in the next decade, in Alberta and Madagascar, in order to step up its oil production from tar sands to 10 per cent of its global production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning's action follows &lt;a href="~/link/a2588a5091ff4047b6d4e75fdb5af130.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; three weeks of intense actions in Alberta. Activists from France, Brazil, Germany and Australia descended on Canada's tar sands to draw attention to what they are calling a "global climate crime."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STOP tars sands, GO to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If production increases as planned, annual tar sands emissions are expected to quadruple to 126 million tonnes by 2015. In order to avoid runaway climate change we need to be drastically reducing these kinds of emissions - not increasing them. The best chance we have is coming up at the end of this year when the UN Climate Summit will be held in Copenhagen. World leaders must attend this meeting and agree to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will drastically reduce our emissions and prohibit projects like the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Apple makes a stand for climate. Who will join them?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a murmuring of discontent within the Chamber over its lobbying against &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-critical-of-draft-s"&gt; US climate legislation&lt;/a&gt;. It has rapidly gathered pace over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson publicly stated their opposition to the Chamber's stance earlier this year. The energy company PG&amp;amp;E left, closely followed by Excelon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple took the most radical step so far, announcing on Monday it was leaving immediately because it did not support the Chamber's position on Climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who will be next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies with high-profile climate positions must be shifting a little uneasily in the boardroom right now. Staying silent on this issue is definitely not showing the leadership Apple and others have shown by speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/coolit"&gt;Cool IT Challenge&lt;/a&gt; specifically calls on the IT industry leaders to show real climate leadership. &lt;a href="~/link/0f310e3ab69544948af86fa86ecccf59.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="~/link/097a1c87e2c04f7ea4812ee7cb3cb7e1.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; IBM&lt;/a&gt; sit on the &lt;a href="http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/all.htm"&gt;Chamber board&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, both have a financial interest in tough laws on emissions: they sell technologies and software which would be needed to cut emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for IBM and Microsoft to speak out against the position of the Chamber -- or do what Apple did, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisive moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might ask why is this a big deal? Many members of the Chamber have at least in words expressed support for legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they pay dues to the Chamber that uses this money to lobby for exactly the opposite. It's not a small amount either -- the Chamber spent US$488 million between 1998 to 2007 on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly object to the Chamber's recent comments opposing the EPA's effort to limit greenhouse gases... Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and it is frustrating to find the Chamber at odds with us in this effort... we have decided to end our membership &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of money buys a lot of influence in Washington's corridors of power. The Chamber hasn't been shy about its position either. In August it stated it wanted to put the science of climate change on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chamber &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/scienceandsociety/2009/10/green-apple-firm-is-latest-to-leave-us-chamber-of-commerce.html"&gt; questioned Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;' personal judgement in deciding to leave. Rather than lecturing Steve on innovation, the Chamber should be focussing the innovation needed to reduce emissions and the jobs this will create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the growing public spat between Apple and the Chamber we are definitely cheering for Steve. But he could do with some more heavyweight support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which other IT executives are going to match Apple's bold move? The stakes have never been higher for the climate. Apple's move will throw an uncomfortable spotlight on any company that stays on in the Chamber but doesn't act to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science says we need deep cuts in emissions and that means significant reductions in US emissions and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/copenhagen-greenpeace-demands/"&gt; a strong global deal in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December. The most progressive businesses know emissions cuts are inevitable and are gearing up to help lead the global economy to a prosperous, low-carbon future. The Chamber's current position represents the voices of the past that got us into the climate crisis. It is time the biggest US companies stepped up to consign this position to  the dustbin of history, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/10/climate_trashing_chamber_lashe.html"&gt; More on this story on our blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/4a75882fea2c4e36941400692ea057b0.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Sign our petition to Google, IBM and Microsoft to call out the US Chamber of Commerce for its opposition to climate change legislation, or follow Apple's lead and quit the lobby group altogether.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;The bottom line is: we can't stop runaway climate change without you. Whatever you can give today will help us ensure there's a decent planet left for us all tomorrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We are thrilled to announce that one of our staff members, René Ngongo, has today been named a recipient of the 2009 Right Livelihood award.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rene Ngongo in Brussels 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo has been working closely with Greenpeace to save the Congo Basin Forests (the second largest tropical forest after the Amazon) since 2004, first in his capacity as head of OCEAN and now as Political Advisor for Greenpeace Africa when he led the opening of our first office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life story is an inspiring one. He grew up in Congo, near the Virunga National Park - a truly unique area with outstanding biodiversity which is included on &lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63"&gt;UNESCO's list of World Heritage in Danger&lt;/a&gt;. It was in these forests that he started to dream about becoming a Conservationist. He studied biology in the Kinsagani University where he also worked for several years. René also founded the highly-regarded Congolese NGO "OCEAN" (Organisationconcertée des écologistes et amis de la nature), which often served asa mediator between forest communities and key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the Congo Forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his work to protect the Congo Basin Forest from industrial loggers, René actively developed grassroots solutions and local contacts in remote villages. This infrastructure soon became the basis for educational activities on deforestation/reforestation and general environmental awareness building. Between 1994 and 2002, René developed tools to fight "slash and burn" agriculture. Among these tools were demonstration fields in Kisangani that showed local people possible alternative agricultural techniques. These allowed to diminish the pressure on the forests and provide better income alternatives to local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René coordinated the creation of a seedling plantation (20,000 seedlings) of the most exploited tree species in the Eastern province. This plantation provided trees for several 'green city' events. During these 'green city' (Ville Verte) events, trees were planted in abandoned parks, along avenues and in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of staying when you can leave is one of the most powerful things a person can do. During the brutal war that tore through Congo between 1996 and 2002, René didn't stop his efforts. He was one of luckier people who could have simply left the country, because of his network of friends outside Congo. Instead, he chose to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He monitored the use of natural resources by the different waring groups. During one of his 'green city' tree planting events on the outskirts of Kisangani, the war between Ugandan and Rwandan troops started. René and his invited guests had to search for cover from the artillery battle that suddenly started in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting against destructive logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that the DRC has returned to "relative" peace, more than ever, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/africa/problem/"&gt; the country's intact forests are threatened by large scale industrial projects such as logging&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a World Bank sponsored "reform" and a moratorium on new logging concessions that has been launched 7 years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMLYNmRc_I"&gt;companies continue to exploit the forest with impunity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly - if at all - paid and unequipped local control agents are unable to protect the massive old trees that are being logged and shipped to Europe and other international markets. But people like René continue the struggle against ecological destruction and social injustice. In his own words "Our forests are our livelihoods. They cannot be reduced to a cheap export commodity. For millions of people, the forests are their supermarket, their pharmacy, and the foundation of spiritual and physical health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt; Forests are also vital for our global climate&lt;/a&gt;. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from deforestation. In January 2009, the government concluded a legal review of 156 logging titles, and deemed 91 of them illegal. Despite this, some of the companies who have been not been validated continue logging today. Rene insists: "We have alternatives. We don't need to sell our forests for meager short term profits. We know today that our forests are worth more standing then logged, this is why we need a strong agreement and support for a global financial mechanism to reduce emissions and to end deforestation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Nobel Prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/"&gt;Right Livelihood Award&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the alternative Nobel Prize. It honours those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today. Several winners are announced every year and receive the prize in early December. We are beyond happy that Rene is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René's entire work is recgonised by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation today: "Since 1994,including through the civil war from 1996-2002, René Ngongo has engaged, at great personalrisk, in popular campaigning, political advocacy and practical initiatives to confront thedestroyers of the rainforest and help create the political conditions that could halt itsdestruction and bring about its conservation and sustainable use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the award, Greenpeace International Executive Director Gerd Leipold said: "While we hope President Obama turns his Nobel Peace Prize into real action for climate protection at this December's United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, it is people like Rene Ngongo who have already started the heavy lifting. People like René are the real climate leaders and it is good to know that at the very least one climate hero will be honored in Scandinavia this December."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Be part of Rene's life work: ask for protection of the forests for the sake of the climate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Global cattle giants unite to ban Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/global-cattle-giants-unite051009/</url><text>
	Today we have good news from the Amazon. Four of the biggest players in the global cattle industry have joined forces to reduce their carbon hoofprint and back our call for zero deforestation. JBS-Friboi, Bertin, Minerva and Marfrig are going to stop buying cattle from newly deforested areas of the rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/smoke-from-man-made-forest-fir-3.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Brazil's cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country’s leading carbon polluter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a direct result of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;', which we published less than 4 months ago. Since then, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies, including Adidas, Nike and Timberland worked with us to develop a zero deforestation plan and committed to cancel contracts unless their products were guaranteed to be free from Amazon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's announcement was made at an event in Sao Paulo, where each of the companies adopted new environmental and social standards to clean up their act and to ensure their products do not come from cattle raised in newly deforested areas of the rainforest. The plan will also help bring an end to the land-grabbing and social injustice that is rife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Supermarkets (ABRAS), which includes Walmart and Carrefour, was at the announcement and supports the call for zero deforestation. Governor Blairo Maggi of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon and the largest cattle herd in Brazil was also there. Maggi announced that the state would support efforts to protect the Amazon and would provide high-resolution satellite images for monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making it work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures include the monitoring of supply chains and clear targets for the registration of farms that both directly and indirectly supply cattle as well as measures to end the purchase of cattle from indigenous and protected areas and from farms using slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian cattle sector, which occupies 80 percent of all deforested areas of the Amazon, is the country's leading carbon polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the United Nations General Assembly in September, President Lula announced a target of 80 percent reduction in deforestation by 2020 for Brazil. Deforestation accounts for around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world's trains, planes and cars put together. A good climate deal will only be effective if it successfully tackles emissions from both fossil fuels and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 62 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil is ready and committed to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders to attend this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and there agree to an effective deal to avert the impending climate crisis. To keep global temperatures at safe levels, the deal must include the funds needed to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US $140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, so that developing countries can prevent and adapt to climate change. Approximately US $40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2015 in Brazil and Indonesia and by 2020 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>World leaders block Arctic coal shipment </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/coal-arctic-svalbard021009/</url><text>
	Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and other world leaders took non-violent direct action today against a coal mine in Svalbard, denouncing the fossil fuel that is powering the meltdown of the Arctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/world-leaders-block-the-convey.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders know they need to quit coal to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now THAT's the kind of headline we want to see in newspapers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Obama, Merkel and their friends are not really in Svalbard. Activists, wearing face masks, are doing what world leaders should be doing: stopping coal, the single biggest man-made cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of world leaders, it was left to our activists once again to take action. We started blocking the conveyer belt of the Svea mine, which was bringing coal to the  transport ship &lt;em&gt;MV Pascha&lt;/em&gt;, early this morning. Activists stopped operations by occupying a loading crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 10AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists are being removed from the coal loading site by police now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8AM CET Saturday October 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked operations throughout the night in minus 15 temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're sending a message from one of the places most affected by climate change: a message of urgency to the real world leaders.Banners reading "Coal Climate Crime" and "Coal Powered Arctic Meltdown" are now hanging from the coal crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svea mine is located at 77 degrees North and is one of the closest mines to the North Pole. Coal is exported from here to Europe where it is used to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature outside is below freezing and polar bears are roaming around but our activists are determined to stay on the conveyer belt as long as they can - to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/22_activists_are_now_blocking.html"&gt;Check out the live feed of updates from Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal fired Arctic meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise has been in the Arctic since June, hosting top scientists to document the effects of climate change in the region. They have found that Greenland's glaciers are losing ice at an accelerated rate. In September, the Arctic sea ice reached the third lowest minimum extent on record. The Arctic is melting down faster than scientists have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea-level rise could impact the homes of one in ten people on the planet this century. This coal-fired madness must stop. Our Energy [R]evolution report presents a realistic scenario showing how we can phase out coal fired power plants by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: take action (for real this time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just 66 days, the countries of the world will come together to negotiate a new climate treaty. World leaders need to take real action by personally committing to attend the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, and to delivering a fair, ambitious and binding deal to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/call4copenhagen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;We need real leaders at the UN climate summit this December in Copenhagen. Join the global call for them to personally attend the meeting and ensure a fair, ambitious and binding treaty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Sending a ship to the Arctic isn't cheap. We've only been able to do it with support from people like you. Take the opportunity to make a difference for tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our jaws hit the deck and we all fell out of our inflatables when we got word that Presidents Obama, Lula, Zapatero and Prime Minister Hatoyama were going to show up in Copenhagen. And then we found out that instead of showing up in Copenhagen for the UN Climate Summit in December, world leaders were actually going to be there today, 2 months ahead of schedule, to lobby the Olympic Congress for their cities to host the 2016 Games.

            Acitivists make sure President Obama knows that his presence is required again in December at the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure the world leaders knew that their presence is required again in December, activists hung a huge reminder from the St Nicholas Church Tower reading "Obama: Right city, wrong date". The tower overlooks the church square where President Obama will be meeting with the Danish Prime Minister and Royal Family later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Olympic spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play is exactly what is missing from the current climate negotiations. Obama needs to help set a new pace in the climate negotiations, leading from the front instead of coasting at the back," said Jon Burgwald, Greenpeace Nordic climate campaigner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going for gold in December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to go for gold in December, and the big question is will Obama be a team player? Now that Obama, Lula and Zapatero all know where Copenhagen is they should have no problem making their way back in December, to lead the talks to a fair, ambitious and binding deal that averts a climate catastrophe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads of state have to show up to the climate summit in December if we want a fair and binding climate deal. The promises that are on the table need to improve significantly, and that can not be done by delegations or environmental ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country in the world takes part in the Olympics, every country aims to win. No country will be free from unchecked climate change. Unless world leaders agree to avert climate chaos, we are looking at mass starvation, mass migration and mass extinction. Without the required leadership we will all be losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; - 26 activists have been arrested placing other banners around Copenhagen reminding the world leaders they need to come back to Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;The UN Summit in Copenhagen is less than 9 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate and show up to Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We will continue to fight to get world leaders to take responsibility and show up at the UN Summit in Copenhagen. We don't accept money from governments or corporations so we rely on support from individuals like you. Please give what you can so we can continue to fight for a fair deal at the UN Climate Summit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Levi Strauss &amp; Co. today committed to go toxic-free. Why? Because you and hundreds of thousands of other people demanded that Levi’s “Go Forth and Detox”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox"&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" title="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/victory-LEVIS.jpg" alt="Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Levi's commits to Go Forth and Detox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest denim brand joins ten other clothing companies that have made &lt;a href="/detox"&gt;credible commitments to Detox&lt;/a&gt;, including the world's largest fashion retailer, Zara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi's commitment comes just eight days after we launched our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Toxics-reports/Toxic-Threads-Under-Wraps/"&gt;“Toxic Threads: Under Wraps” report&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, and screened a &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/because-we-fight-for-life/blog/43359/"&gt;documentary about a family&lt;/a&gt; struggling to hold factories in the region to account for the pollution they are causing, including suppliers of brands like Levi's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is living up to its claims of being a leader. Competitors that have so far failed to take responsibility for the pollution created along their entire supply chain are looking increasingly exposed. These include familiar big brands names such as Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A change of direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href="http://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Levi-Greenpeace-Detox-Solution-Commitment.pdf"&gt;commitment from Levi's&lt;/a&gt; is great news for people power and the environment. Levi's will begin requiring its largest suppliers (each with multiple facilities) in China, Mexico and elsewhere in the Global South to disclose pollution data as early as the end of June 2013. This means that's those living near all these facilities gain crucial access to information about discharges into their local environment – a basic right that up to this stage they had been denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than use hazardous chemicals in the first place, Levi's will look for non-hazardous alternatives. This is a bold move away from its previous position, which was focused on managing rather than eliminating hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition, the company has embraced the precautionary principle, which will be fundamental to shift the entire industry towards the adoption of non-hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toxic-free fashion is a trend to last the seasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 400,000 people have joined the Detox campaign since we re-launched in November, demanding toxic-free fashion and clean water. Fashionistas, activists, designers and bloggers took action on Twitter and Weibo, spreading news about the industry's toxic addiction and reaching many millions of friends and followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/buzz-screenshot.png" title="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted"&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl04_Image1" title="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2012/detox/buzz-screenshot.png" alt="The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;The Levi's hashtag #GoForth really took off this month, but not exactly as Levi's predicted&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Zara committed to Detox, then Mango and Esprit, as people around the world made their voices heard. Levi's was next on the shopping list, and in just eight days hundreds of thousands of people had called on the brand to match its bold proclamations with real actions. Activists and volunteers also took to the street in over 20 countries to take the message directly to the brand's customers and to speak with the staff working in their stores, who sent the message back to Levi's HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x173k1cRSzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has again shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while 11 top brands have now committed to Detox, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help spur on the next success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XxFWo4sCzCs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know brands like Calvin Klein, GAP and Victoria's Secret monitor social media as closely as they monitor traditional media, and every time you like, share, comment on, or promote this video, it increases the pressure on these companies to change their ways: to stop poisoning rivers in the countries where their products are made, and stop shipping hazardous chemicals all over the world in their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A toxic-free world is possible. Together we can help create it.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Green points for Hewlett Packard and Apple</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hp-gets-the-message-30-10-09/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;HP's penalty point lifted in latest Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Apple and Hewlett Packard get green points this month, as HP is rewarded in the latest edition of our Guide to Greener Electronics and Apple releases details of their greenhouse gas emissions. But the big points go to activist consumers for proving once again that public pressure creates positive change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When the gadgets we use go to Delhi for recycling, their toxic contents end up in acrid smoke.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; ranks the 18 top manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones, TVs and games consoles according to their policies and practice on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is published quarterly. We went to press before &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment" target="_blank"&gt;Apple's updated environmental information&lt;/a&gt; was published last week, but the welcome news of their transparency about greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental disclosures will be factored in to the next edition. Apple can justly pat itself on the back for listening to their customers who asked for greener gadgets. And all you Apple users should pat yourselves on the back for asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard had their penalty point lifted by putting a personal computer on the market that is virtually free of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic/"&gt; PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, or vinyl plastic) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs)&lt;/a&gt;. Only the power supply unit and cable still contain these hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP back on track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP made a commitment in 2007 to have all PC products toxic-free in 2009, but went soft on that commitment earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we painted a protest on Hewlett-Packard's roof saying that HP stoodfor "Hazardous Products," and organized a phone-in protest with thevoice talents of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/breaking-green-promises" target="_blank"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;.With the new &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090915xa.html" target="_blank"&gt;HP ProBook 5310m notebook&lt;/a&gt;, HP has made the first step incatching up with Apple, which eliminated these materials from itsentire product line almost a year ago, and now puts pressure squarelyon HP's competitors to put more products on the market that are cleanerand safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; are still ahead on toxics removal, having eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, partly as a result of our "Green my Apple" campaign which brought consumer pressure to bear from people who loved their Macs, but really wished they came in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow learners: Dell and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and Lenovo each retain a penalty point for delaying their phase-out commitments indefinitely. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/acer-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will still achieve its target for eliminating PVC and BFRs in all products by the end of this year. Meanwhile Toshiba has a timeline to phase out these toxic substances from all its products by the end of March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top of the class: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Philips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; remains at the top of the ranking, with a score of 7.5 out of 10, followed by &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; with 6.9, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; with 6.5 and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; -- which leaps from 7th to 4th place -- with 5.9 points. The other climber is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/sony-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt;, rising from 12th to 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow-footed: LGE, Fujitsu and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt; plummets from 4th to 11th position, weighed down by a penalty point for flip-flopping on its promise to get off the toxic sauce by the end of 2010 - now, only its mobile phones will be free of these PVC and BFRs by then, while phase-out in TVs and monitors has been delayed until 2012. At the bottom of the ranking, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fujitsu-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, with a score of 2.7, overtakes &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-13/"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from 16th to second-last place with a score of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world needs climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition of the guide -- which also ranks companies on climate and energy criteria -- is released just two months before crucial climate change talks take place in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these powerful tech companies to stand by their claims and set examples of strong leadership for other industries to follow. It's encouraging that Philips, Acer and Samsung support the levels of greenhouse emissions cuts required to stem dangerous climate change. However industry giants like Apple, Nokia and Microsoft are failing to show climate leadership by making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take a quick survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=5uAfaHmYlBd_2fqhPFvjeTnQ_3d_3d"&gt;We'd like to ask you a few questions to help make our next hi-tech climate campaign a success. Got a minute? Please take the survey!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/supportus"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we couldn't hold companies like these to account. Be part of a greener future -- donate now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Zara, the world’s largest clothing retailer, today announced a commitment to go toxic-free following nine days of intense public pressure. This win belongs to the fashion-lovers, activists, bloggers and denizens of social media. This is people power in action.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Volunteers dressed as 'revolting mannequins' at Zara stores around the world on Saturday.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigners began a dialogue with Zara (a brand within the Inditex group) in 2011 about eliminating releases of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and clothes. But it wasn't until this week that the fast-fashion giant caught on to the urgent need to solve its toxic pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara has now committed to eliminate all discharge of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. And they're going to get rid of some of the worst chemicals, such as PFCs, even sooner. As a significant user of PFCs, Zara's commitment to eliminate this chemical group by the end of 2015 is a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detox commitment announced today covers Zara and the seven other brands in the Inditex group: Pull &amp;amp; Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitment is good news for the environment, but also a breakthrough for the public's right to know what is being released into our waterways. Zara says that by the end of 2013 at least 100 of its suppliers in the Global South (including at least 40 in China) will publicly disclose data about their releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment. The open data will be chemical-by-chemical, facility-by-facility and at least year-by-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Climbers unfurled a giant banner at Zara's store and Swiss head office in Geneva, tweeting live from their phones to ZARA and supporters. 

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday we &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/the-toxic-tale-behind-your-clothing/blog/43044/"&gt;launched the Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt; globally with a fashion show and press conference in Beijing. Related images and comments began to rise like a spring tide on social networks within hours of the story breaking. Zara's Facebook Page quickly filled with comments from fans calling on the company to Detox. Thousands of people began to share their desire for “fashion without pollution!” and demands for Zara to Detox on Twitter and Sina Weibo, China's leading microblogging site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see who's commenting about the campaign &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/zara/Detox-ZARA-Social-Media-Buzz/"&gt;on Twitter and Weibo in one place&lt;/a&gt; – people around the world speaking out in a dozen languages to a combined reach of more than 7.1m followers. On Twitter alone there were at least 43,800 mentions of Zara and the Detox campaign this week. More than 300,000 people signed up to join the campaign to Detox Zara, and many tens of thousands of people emailed and tweeted directly to the company for an ambitious Detox commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- *** VIDEO *** --&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jWhLN0Ag_Dg" width="601" height="338" border="0" style="border:0px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/fashion-without-pollution-so-hot-right-now/blog/43128/"&gt;700 Greenpeace volunteers in 20 countries&lt;/a&gt; were out at Zara stores on Saturday. In the days before, climbers and other activists delivered the Detox message at Zara flagship stores and HQ buildings in Hong Kong, Budapest, Geneva, Hamburg and Madrid. Photos and videos of the actions have been trending on Twitter for days for searches like “Zara” and “Fashion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara's commitment to act more transparently is a milestone in the way clothing is manufactured. It's an important step in providing local communities, journalists and officials with the information they need to ensure that local water supplies are not turned into public sewers for industry. Zara's transparency revolution will be key to ensuring that as brands commit to Detox they then really follow through on achieving zero discharges by 2020. With so many businesses engaging in greenwashing, it's important for consumers to know who they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zara now joins &lt;strong&gt;Nike, Adidas, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/Clickers-and-Stickers-Make-HM-Detox/"&gt;H&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/full-marks-for-marks-spencer/blog/42722/"&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/important-step-down-the-catwalk-to-toxic-free/blog/37928/"&gt;C&amp;amp;A and Li-Ning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; who have also committed to Detox but other top clothing companies still need to respond to the urgency of the situation and Detox. We tested &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/toxic-threads/"&gt;clothing items from 20 leading brands&lt;/a&gt; this year and found hazardous chemicals in them that break down in the environment to form toxic pollution. But by working with their suppliers and switching to non-hazardous alternatives, the clothing companies can become part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising tide of people power has shown what it's capable of. But unfortunately the toxic discharges from clothing factories continue, and while Zara is a big fish, more companies must recognise and act upon the urgency of the situation before our work will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fashion-lovers, activists, environmentalists, bloggers and celebrities will be back for more - toxic brands be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help get our new video, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/detox-fashion/"&gt;Detox Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, on as many screens as possible.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Here's how: &lt;/strong&gt;Watch, Like, and Share this animation aimed at getting the fashion industry to stop discharging hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

	Yes, it’s true, we do indeed have scientists.  And some days, we even let them out of the lab. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Dr Paul Johnson
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days.  Our Greenpeace Chief Scientist, Dr Paul Johnston, has travelled from our international laboratory at the University of Exeter, UK to Ottawa, Canada to further our campaign to create a global network of marine reserves to protect the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has worked with scientists ever since the organisation's founding days in the early seventies.  Recently, some of the world's best scientists have sailed on the Arctic Sunrise to monitor the growing threat to the Arctic region from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnston is attending the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Ottawa to stand up and defend the oceans. Greenpeace wants to see 40 percent of the world's oceans fully protected through a global network of marine reserves. We are aiming high with our 40 percent goal, as the &lt;a href="http://www.wdpa-marine.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;World Database on Marine Protection&lt;/a&gt; reports that currently, less than 1 percent is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1 percent, the majority of marine and coastal protected areas are situated within country Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), leaving the high seas devoid of protection. Even more startling, is the fact that only 12.8 percent of protected areas can be considered as true marine reserves, meaning closed to all extractive activities including fishing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the CBD put ink on paper, pledging to establish a global network of marine reserves by 2012. Five years later however, the pledge is still struggling to make it off the page and into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years we've been trying to help governments designate areas for protection -mapping it all out for them in the Roadmap to Recovery, launched at the CBD in Brazil in 2006.  Last year, the CBD adopted criteria to identify areas for protection, which were very similar to our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with two case studies on how marine reserves could work in the Pacific and Mediterranean, Dr Johnston will be giving advice on how to implement the criteria to identify areas for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships have been in action in the &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/bluefin_tuna_action_in_turkey.html"&gt; Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/09/voices_of_pacific_activists_te.html"&gt; Pacific&lt;/a&gt; this year - highlighting the need for protection, especially confronting overfishing of tuna stocks which are decreasing at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Dr Johnston will show in Ottawa, change can be made to protect our oceans. We have the solutions, we just need governments to hear us out and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently 160,761 supporters have helped us be heard and defend the oceans by signing our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt; Marine Reserves Petition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know what you buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species"&gt;If you're a fish consumer, check the red list before buying fish to make sure the fish has been sustainably fished. Tell your retailer if they don’t know where it came from, you don’t want it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments. This means we rely on individuals like you to continue working towards a safer climate for everyone. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists stop climate crime in the tar sands</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activists-stop-climate-crime-tar-sands/</url><text>
	What is soon to be bigger than England and account for more greenhouse gas emissions than the Czech Republic? The tar sands of northern Alberta, Canada - the largest energy project and the largest industrial project on the face of the planet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/this-is-what-unrestrained-foss.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/this-is-what-unrestrained-foss.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is what unrestrained fossil fuel development and unchecked emissions looks like.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning of September 15th 25 Greenpeace activists enteredthe Albian tar sands operation and proceeded to blockade themselves inthe cabs of two dumptrucks and one crane. They remained on the site for30 hours, successfully shutting down the entire operation and sending astrong message: the &lt;a title="tar sands" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tarsands"&gt;tar sands are a climate crime&lt;/a&gt; and they must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tar sands - sometimes referred to as oil sands - are one of thedirtiest sources of oil on the planet, and extracting thisunconventional oil resource has created a truly hellish landscape. Vastareas of wilderness are chewed up andreplaced by toxic lakes, open pit mines, refineries, andpipe lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting tar sands deposits is hugely energy intensive and produces emissions to the tune of &lt;strong&gt;100 million tonnes of carbon per day&lt;/strong&gt;. Worse, most deposits are located underneath boreal forestwhich must be completely destroyed to extract the tar sands whichfurther accelerates climate change. TheCanadian boreal forest is a huge carbon storehouse, and emissionsresulting from this deforestation have yet to be included in theofficial emissions. Not that the atmosphere cares about the officialnumbers. It is clear that tar sands development ispushing us towards catastrophic, runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate leaders don't buy tar sands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that world leaders still need to get the message. We will continue to expose the horror of the tar sands until they face the urgent facts and wean themselves off the brutal addiction to fossil fuels which threatens us all with catastrophic climate change," Mike Hudema, Climate Campaigner with &lt;a title="gp canada" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Canada&lt;/a&gt;, commented from the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the mining site, Greenpeace will continue to bear witness to the total devastation that is the tar sands. The message going into critical UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December is that climate leaders don't buy tar sands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="430" height="330" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockade coincided with the release of climate demands from the world's largest global investors - who issued a &lt;a title="statement" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for 'strong action this year from international policy makers in the fight against global warming.' Signed by 181 investors in total - this is the largest statement of its kind in history and shows that the future lies in a green, sustainable energy industry - not in the tar sands. It also makes clear the expectations investors have for world leaders this year. It was issued 80 days before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - which is the best chance the world has to agree to serious emissions cuts and strong climate policy that will avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's recently released 'Green Jobs' report shows that this green energy future is not only possible, but it is beneficial to jobs in the energy sector. It is the first ever jobs analysis of a clean energy scenario made on a global scale and is part of Greenpeace's &lt;a title="energy rev" href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate_change/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario. &lt;a title="working climate" href="/international/en/publications/reports/working-for-the-climate/"&gt;Working for the Climate&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that the shift to a renewable-energy based global system would be our best bet for environmental, energy and job security. By 2030 the report projects we could have &lt;strong&gt;8 million renewable and efficiency power sector workers&lt;/strong&gt;, while in contrast, if we continue with business as usual the energy sector would lose jobs - 500,000 of them by 2030. The choice is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A poster child for climate destruction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of the tar sands bring home exactly how devastating and destructive this energy project is for the environment. The toxic lakes created by water discharged from the extraction process are so vast they can be seen from space, and so toxic that cannons have to be regularly let off to scare away wildlife. This does not stop 11 million litres of leakage to occur per day. Even worse than what has already been done is the pace at which tar sands development is expected to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

The projections made are frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tar sands emissions are bigger than Estonia and Lithuania right now andin 2020 will be larger than countries like Belgium, Austria, Irelandand Denmark," explains Nikiforuk. These are daunting figures which make it all the more pressing that our world leaders take responsibility and act on climate change. They could learn a thing or two from the 25 activists that successfully shut down the Albian mine operations. One of the activists had this to say afterwards: "We look atour logo 'Stop the tar sands' which seemed so extreme a week ago - andnow it seems possible."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It's obvious we need solutions to climate change as well as real assistance to developing nations. SolarChill is a new ozone-layer friendly refrigeration technology running entirely on solar power, enabling the safe delivery of vaccines and food to regions of the world without electricity.

        &lt;p&gt;
            SolarChill prototypes - the vaccine cooler and the refrigerator.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.solarchill.org/index.html"&gt;SolarChill&lt;/a&gt;
was born through separate discussions between Greenpeace,the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World
HealthOrganization. The big challenge: providing affordable
andenvironmentally safe refrigeration for the maintenance of
vaccines andmedicines, and the preservation of food, in parts of
the world thathave no electricity or have unreliable supplies of
electricity. At themoment refrigerators in developing countries
usually use kerosene,propane and to far lesser extent, solar power.
Vital medicine ismost often stored in unreliable kerosene
refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kerosene and vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerosene refrigerators consume about 1 litre of kerosene daily.
Notonly do they emit unpleasant fumes, theyoccasionally catch fire,
they need to be regularly fuelled up, andthey are often not
reliable for maintaining the required vaccinetemperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they are also environmentally harmful as the burning
ofkerosene contributes to global warming. There are approximately
100,000kerosene refrigerators in use today around the world for
coolingvaccines, which means they produce approximately between 73
and 91million kilograms of CO2 each year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What about solar power?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar Vaccine Coolers are already in use in parts of the world
thatlack electricity, and they have proven to be more reliable than
theirkerosene counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are only approximately 6,000 solar vaccine
coolersaround the world today. Two big problems: they rely on
batteries, whichare expensive and toxic to make and dispose of, and
they cost more than kerosene coolers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a solar cooler today is in the US$3500 to US$4500
range. Incomparison, the cost of the SolarChill package, cooler and
solar panelscombined, is projected to come in around US$1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The birth of SolarChill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, at about the same time as we were talking with
UNEP andWHO, the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) began the
development ofa new solar refrigerator that bypassed the use of
batteries. We decidedto join forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided the funds for the development of the first
SolarChillprototypes. These were exhibited at the World Summit on
SustainableDevelopment in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What's so special about these refrigerators?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="179950" mode="story"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarChill refrigerators don't need batteries or a connection to
theelectrical grid - they store power in three 60W voltaic panels.
They dohowever have an AC/DC converter, which provides flexibility
to usewind, hydropower, bio-gas or grid energy (and even a
carbattery!) when there is not enough sun. The coolers are also
energy efficient because theyhave excellent insulation. They don't
contribute to globalwarming thanks to the special hydrocarbon
system made by our friends atDTI and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even maintaining a constant temperature, important where
medicine isconcerned, doesn't need an electronic controller - it is
managedthrough natural convection methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single SolarChill unit can serve a population of 50,000 people
forpreserving vaccines, and will be 50 - 60 percent cheaper than
currentsolar refrigerator models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Can I buy one for my new kitchen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet ... a second generation of prototypes of the SolarChill
VaccineCooler went into field testing at the beginning of 2004 in
Senegal,Indonesia and Cuba. 10 prototypes of the chest freezer
vaccine coolerare being tested under a variety of climatic
conditions, including atthe DTI laboratory in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans call for similar field testing of the upright freezer
SolarChill Food Refrigerator in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the technology will be made freely available
tomanufacturers around the world, so we hope that after that
SolarChillwill be available in both developing countries and your
localdepartment store.&lt;/p&gt;

	I am writing from the Greenpeace Peace Embassy just a few hundred metres from an estimated stockpile of ninety B61 nuclear missiles – each capable of many times the force of the Hiroshima bomb that killed over 120,000 people.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Visitor to the Greenpeace Peace Embassy at a US nuclear weapons base in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Incirlik NATO Air Base in South-Eastern Turkey near
theborders of Syria and Iraq. Greenpeace is here because the
Turkishpeople, including the people of Incirlik, have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;never been informed norconsulted about Incirlik’s deadly secret.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incirlik is a gritty, hardy small town ten kilometres from Adana
- acity of nearly two million. In recognition of its origins, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incirlikmeans “fig orchard”. These days, there’s more concrete than figs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty metres from our door is the first of several &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;formidable doublerazor wire fences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond is another world of neat roads, suburbangardens and
Disney-like buildings. I didn't expect that the nuclearfrontier for
the Middle-East would look quite this sanitized and out
ofplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did not expect that representatives of the world's major
nationswould be so close to total failure to maintain the only
agreement andhope we have to limit and reduce the world's deadly
nuclear stockpiles.In Incirlik,  news of stalemates and
disagreements at the 2005Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting
in New York is grave newsindeed. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Our Embassy is within stone’s throw of a destructive power thatcould obliterate entire nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only robbing them of life but alsopoisoning any future on
their lands. To me, this is the closest realequivalent to the
infamous "Death Star" of Star Wars fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I joined the exceptional team that made the
Embassypossible. They are Greenpeace staff and activists from
Incirlik, Adana,Istanbul, Lebanon and Holland. With guidance and
support from Malta,Amsterdam and even Canada, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;overcome obstacle after obstaclein order to take Greenpeace’s Nuclear Disarmament Campaign to one ofits key frontiers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incirlik base and township is tightly controlled by the
military.The livelihoods of many locals heavily depend on the
military base andsome are openly antagonistic to any sign of
opposition. Just finding anowner willing to rent their place to
Greenpeace, let alone getting thepermission to operate required
exceptional effort and local support.Their efforts and persistence
has meant that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;we are the firstanti-nuclear organisation to successfully establish and maintain apresence in Incirlik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, led by campaigner Aslihan Tumer, launched the Peace
Embassyon the 16th of May. Before the media had arrived, the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; local militarypolice turned up in full riot-gear and blocked all access points to thesite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists who had travelled to Incirlik to cover the event
weredelayed as the team negotiated with the military commander to
allow thelaunch to proceed. Gerd Leipold, the Executive Director of
GreenpeaceInternational, addressed the packed press conference by
phone,highlighting the world's new nuclear perils and the great
need tocounter these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, there was strong coverage in all the major
newsoutlets, including many headlining the presence of 90 nuclear
missilesin Incirlik. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Within 24 hours, the team had already succeeded in raisingpublic awareness and debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I joined Aslihan on a live regional news show.
Eventhough Aslihan had already appeared on many news shows, our
planned tenminutes extended to thirty. The show's host made it
clear that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there is a thirst for more information and discussion about the presence ofthe missiles and their risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Our host encouraged and supported ourcampaign. This was a
response that was repeated when I joined Aslihanand the team to
meet with the Bus Driver's Association in Incirlik anda Worker's
Union in Adana. We later talked with shop-keepers, students,market
stall holders, neighbours, US military personnel and their wivesand
a whole array of local supporters. Motivated to learn more and
havetheir voices heard, people dropped into the centre for long
discussionsover cups of tea. Others looked at our display of panels
of the horrorsof the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just in two days. Since the launch, the team's public
outreachactivities established excellent relations with the local
community.They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;forged links with local organisations and talked to hundreds ofpeople&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both on the streets and in Adana City. The
walking-talking'missiles for peace' helped break the ice and
started many discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having opened the Peace Embassy, keeping it open turned out to
be quiteanother challenge. The military police and a few local
shopkeepersrepeatedly warn the team that there are narrow-minded
and armed peoplehere who are very unhappy with the Peace
Embassy.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; The message is thatthings could get out of hand and it would be better for us to pack upand leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Well, the team disagreed and stayed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stood up for the right oflocal people to know and to
discuss the presence of the missiles. Manylocals from Incirlik and
Adana agreed. They donated their time, theirhospitality - even
their furniture. Many were grateful that the tabooon discussing
nuclear missiles was broken and that they had a chance tohave their
voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as I joined some of the team to walk around Incirlik
earlierthis afternoon, I noticed that hidden between the houses you
couldstill see the occasional grand fig tree. Kids rushed up and
hugged us.I sensed that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;the seeds for a safer life are already here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send a message to the Prime Minister&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1779&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;72% of the Turkish public wants Turkey to be nuclear-free.  Ask the Prime Minister to make it so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give peace a chance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us keep the Peace Embassy going and our activists around the world working for an end to the nuclear threat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The city of Ulsan, Korea has ordered us to vacate our "Whale Embassy" -- built near the site of a planned whale meat factory.  We've told them we'll be happy to leave, once they assure us they will not build the factory.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Whale Embassy in Ulsan, South Korea ... with campaigner Jim Wickens on the phone as usual! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, we uncovered plans by the Korean government to
build awhale meat factory in Ulsan.  The discovery added togrowing
evidence that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea wants to reopen commercial whaling.&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We established our Whale Embassy to open a dialogue with local
peopleabout the government's plans, to explain just how many people
aroundthe world oppose whaling, to call for a cancellation of plans
to buildthe factory,  along with assurances that Korea will not bow
topressure from Japan to resume commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had visitors and volunteers from the local community, the
NewZealand Ambassador stopped by, and a great deal of local
pressattention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City officials embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But City officials are not at all happy with us tarnishing
theirreputation as the "City of whales" with our suggestion that
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ulsan isactually heading toward becoming the "City of whaling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Oureviction notice stated they want usto leave because they
claim we are in the way of the proposed Oceans Day ceremony on May
31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have given us until Monday, May 16th to get off the
site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stifling criticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whale campaigner Jim Wickens says: "It is quite clear that they
want tostifle any criticism of their plans to build the factory.
Today theyshowed us plans of the Oceans Day ceremony being planned,
and on theentire 15,000 square-metre site, they don't have any room
for ourlittle embassy.  We have told them that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;any attempts to evict usforcibly will reflect very badly on their international image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been several attempts at intimidation,
official andunofficial. According to Wickens: "Last night at four
in the morningfour local fishermen turned uplooking for trouble,
luckily there were others awake to come and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been tipped off that in Korea in &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;sensitive political protests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,thugs are often allowed to do the dirty work. There is a
possibilitythat this may take the form of fake fishermen coming to
beat us up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries has &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/korean-whaling-mofa-fax/"&gt;sent a
fax to ourheadquarters in Amsterdam claiming we are distorting the
truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Hygienic" butchering of "accidental" whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
They say that the whale meat factory will merely be a sanitary
measure-- a way to hygienically butcher the whales which are
"accidentally"killed by becoming entangled in nets, and those which
might be killedin a possible programme of "scientific whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" id="accidental whale kills" align="middle" height="235" width="400"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea allows the commercial sale of whale meat fromaccidental
kills.  The Ministry didn't respond to our observationthat &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Korea and Japan individually in 2003 caught more whales byaccident than all the fishing fleets in the world combined reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor did they comment on the stories that local people have told
usabout some methods fisherman use to "accidentally" catch
whales:ramming them with the ship to cause massive internal
injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item item_id="137081" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" mode="story"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With our own eyes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We witnessed the butchering of a juvenile minke whale which
was"accidentally" caught.  The whale meat was packaged up for sale
ata value of US$30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At prices like that, you can well imagine why a city official
might want to build a whale butchering factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who can stop the whale meat factory is Ulsan mayor, Mr.
Park Maeng-woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local businessmen, such as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;deputy vice president of Hyundai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, havebeen vocal supporters of the whale meat factory,
apparently unaware ofthe brand damage which other multinational
corporations have sufferedwhen they've been exposed as having a
close association to whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea hosts the International Whaling Commission meeting this
year inJune. The meeting that could open the doors to a return to
commercialwhaling, which has been banned since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tell the mayor to stop the whale factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're trying to warn Mr. Park Maeng-woo just how passionate
peoplearound the world are about saving whales -- how much his
town'sreputation, the reputation of Hyundai corporation, and the
reputationof his country are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1770&amp;amp;s=gen2"&gt;You
can help us let the Ulsan mayor know&lt;/a&gt; just how important it is
toGreenpeace supporters worldwide that he make the right decision
andcancel the whale meat factory. &lt;/p&gt;

	Bisphenol-A. Doesn't sound very interesting does it? In fact it's a widely used chemical in mobile phones, baby bottles and CD's. Unfortunately it's also a widespread toxic pollutant, even being found in people's blood. We are trying to get the producers and users of such toxic chemicals to change to safer alternatives.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sampling activists blood outside a Bayer chemical plant. Previous test showed that chemicals produced by companies like Bayer are in his blood. To highlight this issue we attempted to return the contaminated blood to Bayer because it includes types of chemicals that Bayer produces at the plant. It refused to accept the blood sample. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have visited two of the major producers of toxic chemicals at
theirplants in Belgium to pressure them to produce safer chemicals
andsupport the inclusion of obligatory 'substitution principle' (EU
speakfor swapping toxic chemicals for safer ones) in upcoming
EuropeanChemical Law (REACH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight just how widespread toxic chemicals like
Bisphenol-A arein the environment we sampled the blood of the
Campaign Director ofGreenpeace in Belgium, Wendel Trio in front of
the Bayer plant thatproduces Bisphenol-A. Previous tests had
revealed his blood iscontaminated with toxic chemicals including
Bisphenol-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know that my blood contained chemicals which unknown
to mecould affect some of my vital organs. It is the same for many
membersof the public. I can only hope, that a group such as Bayer
which isinvolved in health care would have the decency not to
increase thispollution," said Wendel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried to give back the blood sample containing the very
samechemical that Bayer produces it refused to accept it. Seems
they arehappy to produce and sell these chemicals but not confront
thepollution this causes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazardous chemicals must urgently be replaced with substances
thatpresent less or no danger, if we are to avoid a possible future
publichealth problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to make substitution of hazardous chemicals a part
ofREACH is under serious attack by a large part of the chemical
industry,which is trying to weaken the legislation," said Fawaz Al
Bitar,Greenpeace Belgium toxics campaigner. "Groups such as Bayer
and BASFshould stand up and support the obligatory substitution of
problematicchemicals. We are keenly awaiting their commitment.
Companies likeH&amp;amp;M, Sony, Sony Ericsson, which use chemicals in
theirmanufacturing processes, have led the way by committing to
stop usingcertain hazardous chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;inline_item mode="little-teaser" item_id="144994"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups such as Bayer and BASF are ignoring this innovative line.
Thecurrent legislative proposal offers the double opportunity of
setting alevel playing field for all industry and encouraging a
climate ofinnovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Become a cyberactivist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/register"&gt;Discover how you can take action on toxic chemicals by becoming a Greenpeace cyberactivist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us take on the environmentally destructive practices of huge corporations!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Hurricane devastation in the US, flash floods in Japan and a UK village washed into the sea. As climate change gathers pace, devastation caused by extreme weather is becoming more common. Take a visual tour of storm and flood destruction.
&lt;div&gt;

            Local resident contemplates the roof of his home perched on a nearby tree after Hurricane Charley.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year the planet awes us with meteorological phenomena, like monsoons in Asia and hurricanes off the Americas. But however devastating these have been, there was at least some form of continuity and predictability in their seasonal appearances. Now it seems that predictability is a thing of the past, with cases of extreme weather on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Japan suffered from its third typhoon in three weeks. It is the fourth major storm to hit Japan since late August, and is reportedly the most powerful to hit Okinawa since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor harvests, caused by this summer's bad weather and flash floods, are having serious consequences for farmers in northern Europe. Entire fields have been left to rot due to the summer's heavy rainfall. Some countries have had their wettest summer months on record. In 2003, dry weather provided a bumper harvest, but the havoc caused by this year's torrential storms could also reach into 2005, thanks to seed and soil damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more scientists are indicating that climate change is to blame for these recent erratic weather patterns. The concentration of CO2 (the main greenhouse gas) in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34 percent above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="600" height="495" data="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="quality" value="high"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="/international/PageFiles/25758/global_warnings.swf"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report examing the impacts of Europe's changing climate. The report suggests that between 1975 and 2001, the annual number of flood events increased and that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years will see Europe experiencing more frequent and economically costly storms, floods, droughts and other extreme weather. While there will be wetter conditions in northern Europe, the south will have drier weather, threatening agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heat waves, pose a lethal threat to the elderly and frail, as occurred in the summer of 2003. Melting European glaciers are also an issue with EEA report estimating that three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps are likely to disappear by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hotting up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 ºC per decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, serious flooding in 11 countries killed around 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least US$15 billion. In the summer 2003 heat wave, western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30 percent. Melting reduced the mass of Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. Who knows what the economic and social costs of summer 2004 will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Hurricanes too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's hurricane season has dramatically shown the danger of a world with increasingly extreme weather. Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances and now Ivan have made landfall in the Caribbean and Florida. In March, a hurricane hit the Brazilian coast - the first ever recorded in the South Atlantic. These storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and killed scores of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hurricanes are predicted to continue becoming larger and more damaging, with stronger winds and more rain - because of global warming. Extreme weather has been around long before humans started heating up the planet - but we cannot afford to stand by while hurricanes - the most extreme storms on the planet - gather strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that the Earth is getting hotter-and fast. The real question is will we slow the meltdown by curbing our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Stay away from ExxonMobil/Esso!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;ExxonMobil/Esso is the most active company in trying to kill any action on climate change. Exxon has secured court injunctions in several countries to keep us away from Exxon property. We're actually really happy to do so, and we are asking you to do likewise: please, everyone, stay away from ExxonMobil and Esso properties! To make sure we're all clear about this, &lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=1517&amp;amp;s=gen"&gt;send a message now promising Exxon that you'll stay away&lt;/a&gt;. Tell them you won't buy their product, won't go near their pumps, and won't contribute to the war chest that they are using to silence critics and to battle the truth about global warming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;While governments need to act you can also make a difference. Here are two more things you can do now:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/"&gt;Calculate your global warming emissions&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can reduce your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;See if your country has green energy suppliers who sell renewable energy to households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Who are we? Young people who want to change the world! What do we want? Renewable Energy! Make no mistake - the world is heading for climate disaster if we don't change our dirty energy ways soon. The young people of the Solar Generation project don't want to be living in a disaster of our making. They are campaigning now for the switch to clean renewable energy across the globe.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            15,000 postcards from the public calling for renewable energy are delivered in a ball of ice to the Bonn Renewables conference. While there was some progress at the conference it still left much to do to tackle global warming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people have the most to lose from global warming but also
the most to gain from the urgent action that is needed now to
prevent the worst impacts. Right now young people from around the
world are coming together under the Solar Generation banner to end
the inaction that brings global warming disasters closer and
closer. Henry is from China, where clean energy is a must for the
huge population. Abigail, from the Philippines, comes from a
community fighting a dirty coal power station on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now members of Solar Generation are facing possibly their
biggest challenge. Many of them are in Bonn, Germany for a major
political conference on renewable energy. Their challenge is to
bring the reality of global warming to politicians cosseted in
stuffy, plush conference rooms and help ensure the conference will
amount to more than just nice words about renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Abigail addressing renewables conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="60915"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;They
made a start with the chance to make a speech to the first day of
the conference. Abigail addressed the delegates along with Henry
from China and Lisa from Germany:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With what we are experiencing, we, the members of Solar
Generation are putting our feet forward against climate change and
are pushing for renewable energy. Members from different countries
lobby to politicians, organize rallies and camps to increase public
awareness, participate in direct actions and support each other in
raising funds for renewable energy installations. We, the Solar
Generation, are doing what we can. Now is your duty to do what you
can!"(Read the &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/index.php/pages/DisplayPage?id=147"&gt;
full speech&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in China, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.hk/africa/News/Multimedia/photos/israeli-marine-forces-board-th/?campaign_id=32"&gt;
Henry&lt;/a&gt; has been busy with Solar Campus projects to spread the
word on renewable energy to students and lobbying Chinese energy
companies to invest in renewable power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that our actions and passion for our environment
could make waves in our world! We will spread our concerns on
climate change and take action to change the behaviour of power
companies, government and our universities, with the support and
spirit of more and more energetic youths!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if today's political masters rise to the
challenge of tomorrow's Solar Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Take action:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Solar Generation in the following countries: &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.fr/solargeneration/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jugendsolarprojekt.ch/"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergynow.org/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a href="http://www.solargeneration.de/"&gt;Solar

<item><language>en</language><title>Kids for Forests in action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kids-for-forests/</url><text>
	A lot of important politicians are currently doing a lot of talking about preserving the diversity of life on Earth at a global UN meeting. Unfortunately talking is just about the only thing they have been doing to preserve life on Earth for the last 12 years. Future generations will have to live with the consequences of current inaction. That is why kids from regions threatened with destructive logging are in Malaysia to speak truth to the bureaucrats.

            A teenager from Cameroon (foreground) and a girl from Canada (background) at the UN Summit for Life on Earth (Convention on Biological Diversity.) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the world's ancient forests are being logged towards
oblivion. The culprits are logging companies, often acting
illegally, which are turning thousand-year-old forests into quick
profits. The members of our Kids for Forests Delegation see this
destruction of our shared future in their own regions. They have
come to Malaysia, to the meeting of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), to convince politicians to turn words into
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the delegates Omanie Sakespeso, 18 came all the way from
Papua New Guinea to plead with delegates to help save his home from
international logging companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." title="Thai teenagers in traditional dress serve traditional food at the conference." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56764"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"The
forest is my life and logging companies are taking my life away.
The creeks that we used for medicine are contaminated and our
burial sites have been destroyed by heavy bulldozers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omanie pleaded with the delegates: "You must carry out your duty
and protect my last remaining tropical rainforest. It is my first
time out of my country and I came all this way to tell you that you
need to take action now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Forests - furniture or a future?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last CBD in The Hague, 2002, delegates heard politicians
promise to stop the destruction of species worldwide by 2010. In
that time Kids for Forests have continued their campaign to elevate
the level of awareness among their peers on the issues of forest
destruction and ocean degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." title="Kids from the Kids for Forests Project at the Summit on Life on Earth." vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56761"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Clara
Buer, 21 from Germany who gave a speech in The Hague two years ago
is not impressed with the lack of action taken by the international
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Two years ago in The Hague I stood before you. Two years ago
you promised to stop the loss of life on earth. But in two years
nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am deeply disappointed, but I am back. Because young people
never give up fighting for their future and because I still believe
this place is the right place to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forests project" title="Kids for Forests project" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="56749"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;"Your
promise is worth nothing, if you allow the ancient forests to be
boiled to paper or turned into furniture. Your promise is worth
nothing, if there isn't an outcry among you, when huge fleets of
ships take everything out of the oceans unregulated, undocumented
and illegally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kids for Forests youth delegation consists of around 30
young people between 13 and 20 years of age, coming from 13
countries around the world: from Australia/Pacific, Austria,
Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia,
Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Two to three young people from
each country are invited, accompanied by one Greenpeace
chaperon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clara ended her speech with a promise of action: "We are doing
our part. Now, it's your responsibility to set the course for a
global network of protected areas. And let the people affected,
especially indigenous people like Omanie, take part in the
decisions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Worth Fighting for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Kids for Forest Project" title="Kids for Forest Project" vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="56758"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Kids
for Forests and Greenpeace are fighting for protected areas at the
CBD in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Protected areas are the backbone of
conserving life on Earth. It is widely agreed that, if we want to
halt that loss of countless plants and animals that are threatened
with extinction, we need an effective system of protected areas in
every country and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBD commits each nation to establish such a system. But this
goal has not been met: the system of protected areas is not
comprehensive, it does not represent enough of nature's biological
diversity and it is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want the governments to adopt a strong programme of work on
protected areas with strict targets, specific timelines and clearly
identified responsibilities. We want them to tell us who (which
country, which political institution) is doing what, by when, and
how they plan to establish a global network of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the demands of future generations, of children who
don't see the words "biodiversity" on a piece of paper but the
lives of the orang-utans, forest deer, monkeys, gorillas, and birds
that share their world -- and whose homes are threatened in exact
proportion to the threat to our own future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland.  The vast majority of Finland's valuable old-growth is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus.  Metsähallitus' logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value - including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            September, 2003, logging in Sami area
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being involved in a 'dialogue' process with two environmental organisations (WWF and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too - friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there's a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland's three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on customers of Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will entering their supply chain, pending comprehensive agreement on additional protection for these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin to switch all virgin fibre in their supply chain to sources that have been independently certified, at least to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC®).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

            Elephants take Thai Buddhist monks to bless the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands. Ask them to go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work.

	In China, the world's largest food market, 32 food companies, producing 53 brands have agreed not to sell genetically engineered (GE) food. Although non-GE policy is already standard in many countries worldwide, this is the first time food producers have publicly committed to such a policy in China.
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese consumers turn their backs on GE food. Greenpeace Food Safety Roadshow visit to Huaying green community in Guangzhou.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, consumers around the world do not want GE
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food companies in China are joining the ranks of a growing
number of non-GE companies worldwide. This is another blow to the
GE industry, which is already troubled by increasing market
rejection and is desperate to find new markets to dump its unwanted
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some well known brand names appear amongst the 32 food producers
promising not to use GE ingredients in products sold in China
including Lipton, Wrigley, Wyeth and Mead Johnson. These companies
have already been selling non-GE food in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Sze Pang-cheung said "Transnational food
companies are learning the lesson. There is a heavy price to pay
for applying double standards to Chinese consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we revealed Nestle´s ruthless overseas practice of selling
GE food, including baby food, in China and other Asian countries,
the Swiss-based company´s "double standards" met with angry
reactions from Chinese consumers who returned products to
Nestle.&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=7624&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;&lt;br&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GE is unmistakably the growing trend in China. The majority
of consumers do not want GE foods, and the Chinese government is
taking consumer's rights to choose seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released China's first comprehensive survey of consumer
attitude to GE food in January this year. The survey showed that a
clear majority would choose GE-free food over GE food and many
would be willing to pay more for it. An overwhelming majority of 87
percent wanted GE food products to be labelled. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international_en/press/release?item_id=111516&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, the Chinese government introduced compulsory
labelling of GE food. &lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://production.greenpeace.org/news/details?item_id=15856&amp;amp;campaign_id=3942"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has stepped up measures to enforce the labelling
legislation by conducting a nationwide inspection. Agriculture
officials emphasised that producers selling unlabelled GE products
would be penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The choice for food producers is either to label their GE
products and face consumer rejection, or to risk violating the
regulation by covering up the true nature of their products," added
Sze. "Companies simply have to make the right decision for
consumers, the environment and their business interests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge more companies to follow suit to address consumers'
growing concerns about GE food.&lt;/p&gt;

	On different continents in two very different communities, Paul and Ruby are battling Dow Chemical's refusal to take responsibility for its legacy of pollution, shady dealings and disregard for human life.  In Part 3 of our feature, we hear from Paul and Ruby as they strengthen their resolve to keep up the fight - wherever they are in the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Local families play beside the river unaware that  it is being polluted by effluent from Dow's plant up stream.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Ruby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;The world is progressing at a new speed these days - but does anyone stop to think what sacrifices are made at the altar of this progress? We cannot even begin to estimate the many things that we have sacrificed in the name of progress; technology may have made our lives simpler, but the very same technology can be misused for destructive purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are focussed only on their profits, to the extent of being inhuman - and Union Carbide (now owned by Dow Chemical) is the prime example of these. In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my college in Bhopal, my friends and I spend most of our free time discussing the corporate crimes of Union Carbide in Bhopal. Most of my classmates are residents of other states, and knew very little about Bhopal before coming here. In fact, they only knew what the newspapers had told them about the Bhopal gas disaster. But I have related my story to them, and revealed the fact that the disaster was not an accident, but a premeditated acceptance of the 'risks' and a callous approach towards safety systems that 'cost too much' to be kept in operation. Once they have heard the full story, there is an almost unanimous understanding that none of us would ever want to work for a firm like this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="257" height="55" align="left"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;In all its years of operating in Bhopal, the company focussed entirely on its own profits, regardless of the cost of human life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates and I recently attended a seminar on health problems of survivors. My classmates were very moved by this seminar, and offered to help out with putting up posters, inviting people to the subsequent programmes and generally spreading the word. In fact, they all told me that they were keen to help our campaign for justice in Bhopal whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, we were all sitting around and talking about our experience with this seminar, when someone came up with a brilliant suggestion - why not form a youth club to support the Bhopal campaign, and to oppose the work of irresponsible companies like Dow in other parts of the country! I knew this would prove to be a brilliant idea, because the power of youth joining our campaign would make a world of difference to the campaign. It will also ensure that the campaign gets another lease of life, with a new generation joining in to take it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read Paul's story, it seemed almost eerie - to think that he is going through almost the same kind of battle that our community is, and that too, because of the same company. His story and mine seem disturbingly similar. When I read his story, it seemed as if were both living in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's story also strengthened my resolve further - I am now convinced that the battle against Dow Chemicals needs to be fought on the global scale, and spread the word, involve more youngsters in the campaign, and fight them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely wish Paul and his community all the very best in their struggle. Maybe we can swap emails with ideas and tactics to help both our campaigns. While writing my own serial stories, and reading Paul's stories, I have realized the global nature of our campaign. I also feel like I have found a friend in Paul, learnt about his life, and presented our two different, yet similar stories to the millions of readers who log onto the Greenpeace website from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that in 20 years time, when we are both in our 40's we can reflect on the day Dow accepted its responsibilities and did the right thing in Bhopal and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Paul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Since I found out Dow Chemical had quietly been polluting the area around my home for years I have been constantly amazed by this company. I have to give it credit for the amount of hard work and millions of dollars it spends in order to make the public believe it is a responsible company. Rather than tackle the pollution problems of its own making it does all it can to avoid this. Its story is the same be it here in the US or in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered Dow had polluted areas downstream of its [Michigan] plant with levels 9000 times the state clean up levels the Dow denial machine went into overdrive. First it denied it caused the pollution. Next it hired the best PR firms and lawyers and lobbied local politicians to ensure it didn't get the blame. Even so it was proved that Dow caused the pollution. Oops! So then it spends more money on PR, lawyers, and lobbying politicians to say dioxin is harmless. But test results prove levels are dangerously high. Dow now spends money on more PR, trying to spin the test results. It even tried but failed to get the state of Michigan to raise the clean up levels, in an attempt to instantly make the problem disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5" width="297" height="119" align="right"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this denial, lobbying and muddying of these dirty waters costs Dow millions. Just imagine if it had owned up straight away and spent this cash on tackling the problem. That is what the affected communities and I are fighting for. We don't have millions of dollars or fancy lawyers but we have the most powerful weapon - the truth on our side. I am campaigning for a clean up of the river, and ideally medical monitoring of all contaminated individuals' health. Would it have been smart to admit to the dioxin contamination and clean up the problem at the outset, so saving Dow millions? Yes, for sure! I don't understand Dow's thinking, it must have some egotistical management that doesn't like to be proven wrong, maybe that is why they refuse to clean up the river. If only women ran Dow, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything Dow does is wrong and some people in the area have benefited from Dow's presence. But I firmly believe that Dow can make a profit without trashing the environment and harming peoples health. Shame on Dow for unethical business practices and shame on their board members who have denied and denied for years the truth and refuse to except law and moral responsibility for their business actions. Couldn't Dow just take one years profits and instead of giving it to lawyers, PR firms, politicians or shareholders, resolve the problems of its own making? That is all I ask and many others the world over would like to know. Is that a lot to ask for? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposing side will probably say, people like me don't understand business and just want to harm Dow. But it seems Dow can do this itself with poor judgments involving the use of its money. I am not trying to destroy businesses; I just feel a business should have some moral values, at least one moral value. A business shouldn't destroy the lives of others in order to make a few extra bucks. No person or company should do that. A company should respect its workers and their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby shouldn't have to wait 20 years or more for justice after the disaster in Bhopal. People in Michigan shouldn't have to fight against a company and the state in order to enforce state laws. People in government have obviously failed both the citizens of Bhopal and in Michigan, they bend over for Dow at any chance they get, thinking of only themselves. How many more people have to die in Bhopal in order for clean up and how many more silent and slow deaths caused by dioxin pollution do the citizens of Michigan have to face? Sadly enough for me and Ruby, it seems both of our countries value profits over precious life. One can make and create all the money he or she desires, but one can't recreate an aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, or mom and dad after they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose
risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;Ask governments worldwide to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting GE Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept money from corporations or governments.

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnaud Immele (Oenologist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

            Mama Sarah Obama flicks on the lights  after a Solar power system was installed at her home in Kogelo Village, Kenya.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a title="Solargen" href="/international/en/news/features/the-solar-generation/"&gt;Solar Generation&lt;/a&gt; Activists and local youth organisers installed the panels on "Mama Sara's" home, and also put panels on the Senator Barack Obama School in Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar installations are part of a 20 day renewable energy workshop hosted by Solar Generation with 25 participants from the Kibera Community Youth Programme and community members of Nyang'oma Kogelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program helps young Kenyans learn how solar photovoltaic panels generate electricity, about their installation and maintenance and the fabrication of self-assembling solar lamps and their marketing potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what Mama Sarah had to say about the new solar panels on her house: "I am very pleased that my home has been improved thanks to solar energy and I'll make sure my grandson hears about it. Solar power is clean, reliable and affordable, unlike paraffin that is widely used in the area. Also, we now have qualified youth in the village who can help with the upkeep of the systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climate impacts reach Kenya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya, like many other countries in Africa, is on the climate impacts frontline. It has seen a drastic reduction in rainfall in recent years. Drought is amplifying problems in agriculture caused by poor land use and desertification, making Kenya's large scale hydro power unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, investing in solar energy technologies is a win-win strategy. It strengthens the economy and protects the environment, while ensuring a reliable and clean energy supply. The solar industry is ready and able to deliver the needed capacity. There is no technical impediment to doing this, just a political barrier to overcome as we rebuild the global energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes you can too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 108 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Tell President Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and take personal responsibility for their government’s response to climate change and to attend the United Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A climate tipping point is looming closer every day in the Arctic. The more we find out about the Polar Regions, the more we realise that what we know about the impact of feedback effects has been underestimated. Recent discoveries highlight the need for action now, before it’s too late. 
&lt;div&gt;

            The settlement of Tasilaq in Greenland where the Arctic Sunrise stopped to re-supply.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subtropical currents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of independent scientists on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is investigating whether warming subtropical ocean currents are causing Greenland glaciers to melt faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the melt from warming temperatures is a known phenomenon, the influence of currents is less understood, and new research conducted by Dr Fiamma Straneo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution is groundbreaking.  (Or, perhaps, "icebreaking"?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over the last decade we've seen dramatic changes in the Greenland ice sheet; in particular there's been a large loss of mass of ice from Greenland's outlet glaciers. One of the mechanisms we think may have triggered these changes is the inflow of warm subtropical water inside of Greenland's glacial fjords," Dr Straneo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A (frozen) river runs through it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These currents could be causing the dramatic melt of Greenlandic glaciers. Dr Gordon Hamilton, of the University of Maine, has been studying the speed of flow of the Greenland glaciers, and in particular Helheim glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaciers are like frozen rivers, with ice slowly moving downstream at an average of 50 meters per year. Helheim glacier is moving at the speed of 25 meters per DAY. Located further North, the Kangerdlugssuaq glacier moves at an average of &lt;em&gt;38 meters per day&lt;/em&gt;. This is opening the way for the Greenland ice sheet to flow out, melt in the Atlantic Ocean, and contribute to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier is probably the world's fastest moving glacier. It tripled its speed between 2004 and 2005, which tells us the glacier is moving mass out of the middle of Greenland's ice sheet, in the form of icebergs, at a rate three times faster than just a few years ago. This has important implications for both the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the rate of global sea level rise," said Dr Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating feedback effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other feedback effects in the Arctic are highlighted in a new &lt;a href="http://panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/news/?173241/Warming-Arctics-global-impacts-outstrip-predictions"&gt; WWF report&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that  their influence on the global climate also may have been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic multi-year sea ice is increasingly replaced by younger sea ice, making the ice-cap more vulnerable to melting in the summer. This allows the surface water to absorb more heat. The permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is heating up as well, releasing underground methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This methane then further contributes to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report also points out that the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2007 estimates on sea-level rise were too optimistic, and offers new estimates of up to 1.2 meters by the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the IPCC reported an &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter5.pdf"&gt; estimated sea-level rise of 20 to 50 cm&lt;/a&gt;. As worrying as these figures were, evidence now suggest things are worse than they'd thought. The effect that the melting Greenland ice-sheet could have on sea-level rise was not fully included in the IPCC reports, since these findings are too recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we go beyond the tipping point where global warming feeds itself, there will be no going back. The time for action is now. In 95 days, the Copenhagen climate Conference will start. World leaders have to show their commitment to the climate by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;attending and adopting strong emissions targets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell global leaders to go to Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Leather industry giant moves to end Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bertin140809/</url><text>
	Bertin, the world’s largest leather exporter is joining the fight against deforestation and climate change and is finally doing the right thing and backing the call for a moratorium on buying cattle from farms responsible for Amazon deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/jacutinga-farm-mato-grosso-b.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is currently the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of our expose, '&lt;a title="Slaughtering the Amazon" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/" target="_blank"&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon'&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago, we've seen an overwhelming response from companies fighting to distance themselves from Amazon destruction. Major shoe companies Adidas, &lt;a title="Nike victory" href="/international/en/news/features/nike-amazon230709/"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Timberland, Clarks, Geox and Timberland have all committed not to buy leather from Amazon destruction, prompting the recent decision by Bertin to commit to stop sourcing cattle from newly deforested areas and implement a traceability system to ensure the sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, Bertin will register and map all farms which directly supply cattle to the company. For the rest of the supply chain, including rearing and nursery farms, it will implement a traceability system from farms to its slaughterhouses and processing facilities by 2011. They will also ensure that they don't buy cattle from indigenous and protected areas or from farms linked to slave labour, land conflicts and land grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertin's commitment to end Amazon deforestation comes soon after a similar announcement from Marfrig, one of the world's largest beef traders. It leaves Brazilian JBS-Friboi, the world's largest producer and global exporter of processed beef as the last major exporter that has failed to commit to help end the destruction of the Amazon.  Contrary to its competitors, JBS-Friboi is staying silent on the issue and is actually expanding into the Amazon, having rented several new facilities north of Mato Grosso State, an area which has the greatest rate of cattle ranching expansion and deforestation in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's cattle sector needs to follow the soya industry's example and commit to a moratorium. Both the federal and state governments have to ensure a moratorium is effective by mapping, registering and monitoring rural properties and helping the private sector fulfill its corporate responsibilities. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of Amazon rainforest destruction and contributes to making Brazil the fourth largest climate polluter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just 114 days left till the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen. We need Brazilian President Lula to support the industry initiatives and demonstrate that Brazil has measures in place to end Amazon destruction.  We need all world leaders, at this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, to agree on the funding required to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree to a strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This week we have created a granite shield against bottom trawling in a fragile and ecologically important marine area in Sweden. Our activists sailed into Swedish waters and have so far placed 140 granite rocks (each weighing between 0.5 and 3 tonnes) in the Lilla Middelgrund in the Kattegat. Our intention is to move to nearby Fladen and do the same thing there.
&lt;div&gt;

            “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.” -- Ryunosuke Satoro
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These regions, boasting unique and rich marine life, have been protected on paper by the EU and the Swedish government since 2003 (&lt;a id="a6wi" title="Natura 2000" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm"&gt;Natura 2000&lt;/a&gt;) yet lack any mechanisms to actually stop fishing and other damaging activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8194105.stm" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the video on BBC news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a specially equipped barge, our team is placing a number of large boulders on the seafloor to act as obstacles stopping fishermen from ploughing up the rare habitats of &lt;a id="bixa" title="maerl beds" href="http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk/communities/maerl/m3_1.htm"&gt;maerl beds&lt;/a&gt; and bubble reefs. Bubble reefs (underwater structures created by gasseepage) are amazing habitats of great scientific interest that have only recently been discovered in Sweden. But despite the existence of these vulnerable habitats, bottom trawling, one of most destructive forms of fishing, is common throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real protection needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawlers drag a net across the sea bed, indiscriminately catching everything in its path. This decimates stocks of popular fish, such assole and plaice, and results in a large amount of unwanted bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or dying. It also destroys any living structures that have grown on the sea bed - often acting as a sanctuary for an abundance of other life forms. Without apermanent ban on fishing in this area - there is no hope for the preservation of a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, marine protection exists only on paper. But our seas cannot wait any longer, their survival is at stake and politicians need to take action and implement laws that will protect the life of the seas today and for the future. However, under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) countries do not have the powers to regulate or prohibit fisheries. EU fisheries law states that such decisions have to be taken at an EU-level. This Catch-22 situation needs to be addressed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/plattegrond-van-het-kattegat-t.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, we placed 320 boulders in Germany's Sylt Outer Reef, another "protected" site, which was being destroyed by bottom trawling. In doing so, trawlers have been prevented from fishing on the reef and the boulders have already being colonised by a wealth of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long-term solution, we are calling on the Swedish EU-presidency to reform the CFP, enabling responsible authorities in member states to take necessary conservation measures in all types of marine protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fisherman's friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides showing up with some large stones - our team in Sweden has planned and prepared this work for months. An important step was the preparation of an environmental impact assessment to ensure that the activity would not be damaging to the environment. &lt;a href="http://eiastones.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;We also invited anyone interested - fishermen, politicians and all - to comment on our plans&lt;/a&gt;. The scientific impact assessment concluded that the strategic placement of stones would not negatively impact the marine environment, and the responsible authority shared this view and informed us that we would not need a permit. Fishermen from nearby Varberg also recognised theimportance of our proposal. As one fisherman said: "We shall and we must protect the shallow banks and the refuges that exist there. Then perhaps we can even get the wolf fish back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24989/greenpeace-activists-strategic.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to defend our oceans from the effects of over-fishing around the world, we are campaigning for a global networkof large fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of our oceans, including the North and Baltic seas. Supported by scientists - these reserves will restore the health of fish stocks, and protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse. Marine reserves also make our oceans more resilient to the ravages of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call now for a global network of marine reserves - protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	It is finally time to celebrate a major victory for the Boreal Forest! Kimberly-Clark has, as a result of public pressure, released a new environmental fibre policy that governs how it will help conserve forests and support sustainable forestry and use more recycled fibre.

&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;our campaign&lt;/a&gt; has been supported by tens of thousands of activists and hundreds of companies, to demand that Kimberly-Clark (K-C) stop destroying ancient forests like the Boreal Forest. In this tremendous victory for ancient forests,  the company that is known for its popular brands like Kleenex, Scott, and Cottonelle has announced &lt;a title="KC policy" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/KC"&gt;a policy&lt;/a&gt; that places it among the industry leaders in sustainability. This announcement brings the &lt;a title="KC" href="http://www.kleercut.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Kleercut campaign&lt;/a&gt; to a successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we can expect from the new policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark has set a goal of obtaining 100 percent of the wood fibre used in its products - including the flagship brand Kleenex - from environmentally responsible sources. By 2011, Kimberly-Clark will ensure that 40 percent of its North American fiber is either recycled or certified by the Forest Stewardship Council™(FSC®) - a 71 percent increase from 2007 levels, representing over 600,000 tonnes of fibre. Also by 2011, it will eliminate any fiber from the North American Boreal Forest that is not FSC®-certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of K-C's place in the paper products market, the company's new policy will send a strong signal to its competitors, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, SCA, and Georgia Pacific, that creating a policy that protects ancient forests is a key element of sustainable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;K-C's sustainability policy: Not just about protecting the Boreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Boreal Forest is North America's largest ancient forest and provides habitat to threatened species such as woodland caribou, bald and golden eagles, wolverine and more than one billion birds, many of them migratory. Sadly, more than 60 percent of the Boreal has already been allocated to forestry companies for development and less than 10 percent of the Boreal Forest is formally protected. Unfortunately, in provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, much of the commercial forest has already been fragmented and degraded by clearcuts and logging roads...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clear-cutting in forests doesn't just wipe out biodiversity - it wipes out an essential carbon storehouse. The Boreal Forest is the world's largest storehouse of terrestrial carbon. The Canadian Boreal stores an estimated 186 billion tonnes of carbon, or more than 27 years worth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting and managing the forest responsibly is essential for fighting climate change. Intact forests, particularly ones extending over thousands of square kilometres, better mitigate the impacts of climate change. The fight to protect the Boreal and forests globally is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting forests and tackling climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need world leaders to agree on the funding required to end deforestation at this years Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide US 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately US 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations so please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title> Activists block Australian coal as leaders abandon the Pacific</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/australia-coal-pacific060809/</url><text>
	As activists continue a two day blockade of a coal export terminal in Queensland, Australia, the outcome of the Pacific Islands Forum in nearby Cairns has left Pacific Islanders to fend for themselves against the increasingly devastating effects of climate change - because it's clear their rich neighbours are unlikely to help them. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal is the single biggest climate criminal
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal blocking activists from countries including New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Australia and the Cook Islands have been demanding that Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd (Australia) and John Key (New Zealand) stop putting the interests of big polluters over the future and the very survival of Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island leaders this week called for strong emissions reductiontargets of 45 percent by 2020 for developed countries and an ambitious global climate treaty aiming to limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5 °C. On Tuesday, the Small Island States leaders reiterated these demands at a press conference. But just two days later, not only have those demands vanished from the final communiqué, but the 2020 targets have also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of seeing an agreement on emissions cuts to fight climate change, the PacificIslands have received only promises to build higher sea walls against the rising tides caused by, amongst other things, Australian coal exports. This is yet another setback to the already shambolic negotiations process in the leadup to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter where this coal is burned, carbon pollution has no borders. Our homes are being devastated by climate change and we need genuine support from our Australian neighbours, not make-believe emissions cuts and empty &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;gestures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam, activist from Papua New Guinea speaking as he blocked the Abbot Point coal export&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal or climate Kevin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftering our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.au/blog/energy/?p=728"&gt;activists spent 36 hours hanging off the Hay Point coal port&lt;/a&gt;, we sent our ship, Esperanza, to continue blocking the terminal. We have run three days of coal actions, including the complete shut down of the Abbot Point coal export terminal, to highlight the injustice of Australia and New Zealand abandoning their Pacific neighbours while throwing tax payer dollars at dying fossil fueled industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal exports to rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbot Point coal export terminal is set to double in size, financed by more than AUS$328 million (198 million euros) of public money in 2009/10. This will add an extra 67.5 million tonnes of carbon pollution a year - equal to the annual carbon footprint of 2.4 million Australians. And even though the Hay Point coal export terminal is already one of the biggest in the world, it is now being expanded from 112 to 190 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total capacity of Australia's coal exports will more than double from 332 to 730 millions tonnes per year. This expansion is a snub for the Pacific, and an economic and environmental disaster for Australia. By reinforcing Australia's position as the world's largest carbon dealer, Kevin Rudd continues to shun both his neighbours and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling short of weak targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear here: a global temperature rise of 2°C would still cause climate chaos in the Pacific. And if the world adopted the policies Kevin Rudd is implementing there is little chance of limiting temperature rise even to 2°C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24990/australia-coal-block3.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Key is expected to announce New Zealand's 2020 targets on Monday, but they are likely to also fall way short of the at least 40 percent by 2020 required - a target set by the climate scientists and &lt;a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/"&gt;demanded by nearly 90,000 New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that temperature rise must peak as far below two degrees as possible, and to get back to much safer levels after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see more than 12 coal ships waiting to load coal behind me. There are mountains of coal. It is a bit overwhelming - tonnes and tonnes of it. Everything I see here means to me that there's one more family that will be affected, one more child that won't have the future they &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;deserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fenton, Fijian activist speaking while locked onto the Hay Point coal loader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza, which continues to block the Hay Point coal terminal, has just finished a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/07/pacific_voices_on_climate_chan.html"&gt; tour of several Pacific islands where the crew witnessed the impacts of climate change there first hand&lt;/a&gt;. They spoke to many Pacific people who are forced to deal with the changing environment on a daily basis. Now, in Australia - we're continuing to support the urgent Pacific call for world leaders to act now: to take personal responsibility for tackling climate change and guaranteeing a good deal for the climate in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join the call for world leaders to personally attend the UN Climate Summit this December in Copenhagen - and ensure a good deal for the Pacific and the rest of the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We could not afford to block giant coal ports without the financial support of individuals like you. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greenpeace-on-toxic-patrol-in/</url><text>
	The Greenpeace sailing vessel the Rainbow Warrior is currently anchored off the coast of Alang, India. Alang is the site of the world's largest shipbreaking yard. Greenpeace is planning to conduct "toxic patrols" of ships which are here waiting for scrapping. A team of experts will do a survey and take samples to determine what type of toxic materials are on board before the ships are beached and the actual scrapping starts. Shipbreaking is an enormous danger for people and the environment. Greenpeace is the only organization in the world fighting for the 100,000 people working in this industry and for the environment they live in.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Rainbow Warrior on Toxic Patrol in India
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 14th of October the highest court in India decided that
the responsibility for clean scrap (shipbreaking) lies not just
with the shipbreakers, but also, and more importantly, with the
ship owners. This Court Order says that all ships must be
toxic-free before the scrapping actually begins. If the Greenpeace
"toxic patrols" show that ships arriving in India for scraping
still contain toxic substances, we will demand that the Indian
government enforce the Supreme Court Order and take action against
the owners of these ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also lobbying the Indian government to take a
strong position in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
with the other shipbreaking countries (Bangladesh, China, Pakistan
and Turkey). The IMO is the only party, within the United Nations,
which can make international rules for the ship owners. At the
moment they have only proposed voluntary guidelines for the
shipbreaking industry. Greenpeace believes that only a mandatory
international law can effectively regulate the ship owners. At this
stage there are many ruses that ship owners can use to subvert
these the rules and regulations. If India is the only country that
has strict regulations on shipbreaking then ship owners will go
elsewhere to find lax regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;Scrap yard Alang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alang shipbreaking yards started scrapping ships in 1983 and
is now the world's biggest. Alang contains 184 plots which employ
40.000 workers. Current shipbreaking methods pose a serious danger
to both people and the environment. Most of the toxic waste ends up
in the ocean. The workers inhale toxic substances, such as
asbestos, 24 hours a day: at work and, because they live right next
to the yards, at home. They are not provided with any protective
clothing or safety equipment nor are they provided with any
training on how to deal with toxic materials. There are regular
accidents in the yards which often cause the deaths of many people.
In the past three months there have been 4 explosions in which 25
people died. On top of all this most workers are paid on average
US$1 per day and have no system of worker's medical insurance or
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodyhighlightbold"&gt;What Greenpeace wants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is not against shipbreaking or the shipbreakers.
Greenpeace wants a mandatory international law requiring that all
ships must have an inventory of all toxic materials on board.
Locations of materials must be clear. A plan must be made to remove
all these toxic materials before the ship goes for scrap and before
the ship gets scrapped it must be made fuel-free to avoid future
explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

            Parody of Esso logo
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our "Don't buy Esso, Don't buy Exxon/Mobil" campaign,
we developed a parody of Esso's logo with a double dollar sign:
E$$O. (Esso is the name under which Exxon/Mobil trades in many
parts of the world outside North America)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso took us to court for copyright infringement, claiming our
Stop Esso website would "confuse customers" into thinking they were
at a real Esso site. Hmmm. Esso customers must be a particularly
dim lot. Would you be confused by &lt;a href="http://www.stopesso.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that wasn't enough, Esso also made the feeble attempt to
claim that the logo made them look like Nazis, given a similarity
only they could see between two dollar signs together and the
stylized Nazi SS symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" title="Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52918"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;But
the real belly laugh came when Esso claimed that our abuse of their
logo would damage their "good reputation." This is the company that
has done more than any other corporation to undermine the science
and policy debate on global warming. This is the company that
donated massively to George Bush's election campaign, and was
rewarded with the US withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol. This is
the company that despoiled the pristine Alaskan coastline with an
oil spill the effects of which are still with us today. This is the
company responsible for &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040128/energy_exxon_climate_1.html"&gt;5
percent of all greenhouse gasses&lt;/a&gt; on the planet. This is the
company which has been branded environmental criminal #1 and been
targeted by activists all over the world in a massive "Don't Buy
Esso" campaign. If Esso was really worried about its reputation, it
might try doing something for our planet and our children's future
instead of using its gargantuan legal resources to try and stamp
out the wildfire of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court ruled our parody of the Esso logo was within
acceptable limits of freedom of expression, rejecting Esso's claims
of tradmark infringement. Greenpeace has been campaigning against
the oil giant since 2001 when US President George Bush pulled the
US out of the international negotiations to tackle climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso has spent millions in its fight to stop the world's
government's tackling climate change, and was behind Bush pulling
out of the Kyoto Protocol. Esso obviously thought this case would
be an easy win but it was wrong. Today's ruling is a victory in the
fight to protect the climate against a company that will go to any
means to silence its critics," said Greenpeace campaigner, Anita
Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with us. Next time you pass an Esso or Exxon station,
put your thumb to your nose, wiggle your fingers, and say:

<item><language>en</language><title>Canadian harp seal hunt: largest ever</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/harp-seal-hunt/</url><text>
	The Canadian government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 350,000 animals this year. While "whitecoat" harp seals (under 2 weeks old) are still protected as a result of actions by Greenpeace and other organisations in the 70s and 80s, and some of the more extreme animal rights abuses have been outlawed, older seals can still be legally hunted under Canadian law.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/10/a-greenpeace-activist-sprays.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace  activist sprays a seal with harmless dye to render its pelt worthless to commercial hunters in 1982.  An EU ban on killing harp seals under 2 weeks old put an end to the commercial hunt for whitecoats -- but not to the killing of older seals.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's quota is the highest for any year since 1967.
Canada's cod fishery collapsed in the early 90s, and some in Canada
blamed the seals, despite the fact that the greatest culprit was
clearly decades of human overfishing. The collapse of fisheries
around Newfoundland due to mismanagement are a major driver in the
economics of expanding the seal hunt -- and part of an all too
predictable cycle of "exploit, deplete, and move on" which have
characterised human commercial hunts of wild animals the world
over. History has taught us that as soon as a market exists and
profits are to be made, the pressure to hunt a species beyond
sustainable population levels will inevitably lead to a
non-sustainable hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oppose any human activity harmful to populations of seals. We
oppose the killing of seals for commercial trade. We oppose taking
animals from endangered, threatened or seriously reduced
populations, from populations whose status is unknown or where it
is thought a hunt may have an adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add new uncertainties about how global warming is
impacting fragile arctic environments, an expanded hunt means the
impacts on seal populations are at best uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned
against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since
that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, and other organisations, have taken the lead in
campaigning against the slaughter of seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and other organisations taking action against the

	Since the French power authority has refused to build wind farms, we built our own this morning on the grounds of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France. We put ten wind turbines up to protest the French government decision to build another nuclear reactor on the site, despite a large nuclear energy overcapacity and the far more environmentally and economically sane option of investing in wind energy.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists display 10 model wind turbines on the premises of a nuclear power plant in Penly, France in protest at the French government's decision to build another reactor on the site.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franc for franc, wind is the better investment. As detailed in a
report published today, "Wind vs Nuclear 2003" the same money spent
on wind power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more
electricity than a nuclear reactor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of the proposed French reactor is officially estimated
at some 3-3.5 billion Euros. If this amount of money were invested
in wind power, some 7616 megawatts of wind capacity could be built,
compared to 1550 TWh in the nuclear case. Wind would generate a
massive 24 TWh per year, the equivalent of 6.5 million households.
Nuclear would only deliver 10 terrawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years wind power has gone from the hippy fringe to
economic viability. In Germany, over 3,200 megawatts of wind power
were installed in the last year alone, supplying electricity to
more than 2 million households. In the EU, a massive 75,000
megawatts of wind capacity is expected to be online by 2010,
tripling the current power and adding the equivalent electricity
production of 14 large nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this worries the nuclear industry, especially given
the current decline in nukes: no single reactor has been connected
to the grid in the last four years, and it would take at least
another 10 years before a new reactor could come online. A growing
number of old reactors have reached the end of their life
expectancies and should be shut down. In reality, wind has already
taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is urging state owned EdF, Electricity de France,
not to impose yet another dangerous and uneconomic nuclear reactor
on Europe. The EPR [European Pressurized Reactor] is nothing new,
it is an outdated and unsafe design, to be fuelled by plutonium and
will produce extremely radioactive waste," said our campaigner on
site, Jan Vande Putte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europe is at a crossroad and we refuse to let the nuclear lobby
dictate our energy future regardless of the opinion, the
environment and the security of people. Greenpeace asks EDF to make
the right choice."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today informed the French government at a hearing that we will not remove information concerning nuclear waste transports from our websites.  This defies an order from the French Ministry of Industry to treat all information regarding nuclear materials in France and their transport as state secrets.  As a consequence, Greenpeace France and its staff may be facing jail and fines for informing the public about dangerous plutonium shipments.

            Greenpeace activists protesting nuclear power at Cattenom.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An order issued on August 9th in Paris declared all information
regarding the protection of nuclear materials, including
transports, classified for national security purposes. Greenpeace
is opposed to the production, transport and use of plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the transportation of plutonium, released in defiance
of the new decree, will be presented by Greenpeace at a "Special
Commission" that will hold a meeting on nuclear affairs today.
Politicians, Government officials and representatives of Cogema,
the state reprocessing company in Cherbourg, will attend this
meeting. The head of nuclear security within the French Government,
M. Lallemand, responsible for issuing the new security decree, is
also scheduled to testify at the Special Commission hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February this year Greenpeace blocked a nuclear transport
containing 150 kilogram of pure plutonium in the city center of
Chalon-sur-Saone, while en route from la Hague, Normandy to
Marcoule, in Provence. Cogema, the state nuclear reprocessing
company, conducts as many as 2-3 transports every week from its
reprocessing complex at la Hague to its plutonium fuel production
plant at Marcoule. Each transport carries enough plutonium for 30
nuclear weapons. In May, after Cogema resumed transports,
Greenpeace launched a 'citizens inspection' website containing
information on plutonium transports observed by volunteers and
activists along the 1000 kilometre route: &lt;a href="http://www.stop-plutonium.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stop-plutonium.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Putting us in jail to keep us quiet will not remove the
danger." said Yannick Rousselet. "Nuclear fuel shipments are
dangerous to the communities they move through, they are potential
terrorist targets, and they should be stopped rather than covered
up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the order flies in the face of nuclear industry
company Areva's policy of "maximum openness" regarding nuclear
transports. Under the new order, much of what Areva publishes on
their website and releases to the public would be classified
illegal. But according to an Areva spokesperson quoted in Le Monde,
the nuclear industry, which claims it was not consulted on the new
law, was told "we didn't need to change anything in our
communication policy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Opposing nuclear transports in France." title="Opposing nuclear transports in France." vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47188"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
target of the order is Greenpeace, which has exposed the threat
from land and sea transports of nuclear fuel and waste in France
and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear materials travel a cumulative distance of 250,000
kilometres each year in France. One plutonium transport contains
sufficient material for 30 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. One cask
full of highly radioactive spent fuel elements contains
approximately as much radiation as was released by the Chernobyl
disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry claims that the casks are safe because they
have to undergo crash tests. In fact, they are tested to maintain
integrity when dropped 9 metres onto a hard rigid surface, or
dropped 1 metre onto a metal bar. They are tested to survive a 30
minute hydrocarbon fire at 800 °C. And they are cited as safe for
immersion to a depth of 15 metres of water for 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet according to French accident statistics for hazardous
materials, the casks would not withstand 1 accident in 20 involving
impact, and 50% of accidents involving fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transports could also be targets for terrorist attacks or theft:
Pierre Robert, a Frenchman jailed for life in Morroco for
terrorism, claimed to know of Al-Quaeda plans to attack a Cogema
plutonium transport. Greenpeace and WISE, in a report published in
February of this year, estimated that if such an attack were
carried out with heavy artillery near Lyon, it would impact 125,000
people, cause 500 fatal cancers and require the evacuation of part
of the city of Lyon and its outlying suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item hspace="4" alt="Stop Plutonium" title="Stop Plutonium" vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="47173"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;Transports
are carried out without prior notification or consent of the
communities or countries along the transport routes. Last year
Greenpeace tracked and highlighted the dangers of a British
plutonium fuel transport from Japan to the UK. Over 80 Governments
condemned the transport based upon information provided by the
environmental organization along the 30,000 kilometre route through
the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French government's move to silence Greenpeace is consistent
with a larger move worldwide toward greater government secrecy in
the name of security. The nuclear industry in particular is taking
advantage of public fears of terrorist attack to become less
transparent and to silence dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, hundreds of thousands of public documents
were removed from government Web sites following the September 11th
attacks, including Environmental Protection Agency reports on the
consequences of industrial accidents. U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft's Justice Department told U.S. agencies to be more
cautious about releasing records and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If governments are serious about reducing the threat of nuclear
materials," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International "then the
only thing to do is end nuclear power. Increased secrecy
conveniently serves the nuclear industry's agenda of diminished
scrutiny. That means greater risks to an uninformed public, and
less public opposition. Plutonium and nuclear energy are not
compatible with democracy and have no place in our global
society."&lt;/p&gt;

	Our marathon action in Chioggia, Italy came to an end last night after three days of protest when Italian police intervened to end our blockade of the Panama-registered bulk carrier, Keoyang Majesty, which is carrying 40,000 thousands tons of Argentine Genetically Engineered (GE) Soya.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the determination of 18 activists from our ship, the
Esperanza, this action has been going on since Sunday morning, when
they first boarded the Keoyang Majesty displaying banners saying
'Don't Buy GE Food' and 'Defend Yourself from GMOs'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night they left the GE ship for safety reasons, this
morning the focus changed to preventing the trans-shipment system,
used to offload the cargo from the ship onto small barges, actually
reaching the ship. Two activists boarded one of the barges, ten
activists climbed onto the elevator used to take the GE soya out of
the GE ship and six activists were in canoes between the barge and
the Keoyang Majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the blockade the Italian Ministry of Health has
committed itself to carry out an inspection of the GE Soya now
being unloaded from the Keoyang Majesty in order to check whether
the GE cargo complies with EU legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Pagnan, the company importing the GE soya meal, has
stated to our campaigners in Italy that it will provide us with the
list of the buyers for its cargo of soymeal. We will of course be
taking this issue up with these companies and put pressure on them
to go GE-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Keoyang Majesty from Argentina is transporting GE soya meal
for, among others, the multinational companies Bunge and Cargill,
to be used for animal feed. Italy imports 4.2 million tons of soya
annually for food and animal feed of which over 3 million tons are
estimated to be GE or GE contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniela Montalto our GE campaigner from Argentina, who is on
board the Esperanza said: "Argentina is determined to produce GE
soya to feed pigs, cows and chickens in the developed world. Almost
its entire production of soya is GE. What remains of the native
forest lands are being converted for GE soya production, it is time
to stop this environmental and social nightmare in Argentina."&lt;/p&gt;

	Spain is the only country in the European Union that tolerates the release of genetically engineered (GM) crops on a commercial scale. Though only cultivated on relatively small areas, the potential impact of Syngenta's GE maize on environment, agriculture and health and the total lack of information and precaution are of serious concern.

        &lt;p&gt;
            New report from Greenpeace slams the genetic experiment on maize in Spain
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GM maize (corn) contains a genetic construct called Bt 176,
consisting of a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis
that encodes an insecticidal toxin able to kill the European Corn
Borer. It also has a gene that confers increased tolerance to a
herbicide and a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic
ampicillin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngenta's (formerly Novartis) Bt176 corn was first grown in the
USA in 1996. The European Commission approved the placing on the
market of the GE crop in 1997, with a decision that was ignoring
the negative recommendations of the EU's own scientific committee
and the Environment Ministers Council. Several EU member states,
among them Austria, Luxembourg and Germany, prohibited the growing
of Bt176 maize due to concerns over detrimental environmental and
health effects. The Spanish authorities, however, approved the
commercial growing in 1998. While they are still on sale in Spain
today, the Bt176 varieties were already withdrawn in 2001 from the
list of approved varieties in the USA, a country known for its
support for GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="right" item_id="52690"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
Spanish government not only ignored concerns over environmental and
human health risks, but also the fact that a majority of Spanish
consumers, as consumers in many other countries around the world,
say 'no' to GE foods and prefer non-GE products, even if the
genetically modified foods were much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report, "The impact of GM corn in Spain," has been
prepared by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. It reveals the
scandalous sloppiness around the planting of Syngenta's genetically
engineered maize in Spain. While the Spanish administration acted
irresponsibly in largely passing on responsibility for safety
standards to the GE company, Syngenta failed to meet even the lax
requirements that the government did impose. Five years after the
approval of the GE crop, the monitoring / prevention plan has still
not been made public. No official data is available on the exact
area planted with GE crops or on where they are planted; nor is
there an independent analysis of GE crop results in agronomic
terms, of the possible appearance of resistance in pest, of the
unwanted impacts on non-target species and soil ecosystem, or of
the effects of antibiotic resistance genes on animals and
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been proven that the GE varieties cultivated in Spain
give better results than conventional ones and are necessary and
useful for pest control. The low incidence of the corn-borer pest
in Spain does not justify taking the high risk of introducing Bt
maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item vspace="4" border="0" align="left" item_id="52687"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;In
the meantime, the first cases of GE contamination have already
occurred in Spain. In 2001, organically grown maize in the Navarra
region was contaminated by Bt176 maize and, as a consequence,
farmers suffered losses since the crop couldn't be marketed as
organic produce. This illustrates how the 'polluter-pays' principle
is turned into a 'contaminated-farmer-pays' principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-author Juan-Felipe Carrasco of Greenpeace Spain said: "Spain
has become a big experimental field, where GE crops have been
cultivated for the last 5 years without any agronomic advantage
compared to conventional varieties and where no measures have been
adopted to prevent their negative impacts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish situation highlights the need for measures to
prevent the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;genetic contamination of conventional and organic crops and
should serve as a warning for the other European countries. No new
authorisation for growing of GM plants should be granted and, most
urgently, Member States should oppose the plans of the European
Commission to legalise the contamination of seeds by setting up
thresholds of authorised GE contamination in conventional seed
lots. Allowing contaminated seeds to be put on the market would
lead to a creeping and unmonitorable contamination of all European
farmlands by GMOs that would make it impossible to sustain a
GE-free supply after a few years. GE companies should instead be
made legally and financially liable for the environmental and
economic damages their products can cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing genetic contamination and other negative effects of
GE crops should now be the number one priority for the Spanish
Government instead of actively promoting GE agriculture in Spain.
We call on Spain to apply the precautionary principle and to stop
the growing of GE crops. The Spanish example should be a warning
signal to other European countries not to allow GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;

fuel/gases, this is not an easy job. Most shipping companies take
the profitable option of selling the ships to scrap yards in Asia
where ships are broken up on beaches by workers using their bare
hands or minimal equipment. Hence the shipping company makes some
easy money and dumps the pollution from the ship in the developing
countries of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some irresponsible shipping companies want to spread this toxic
trade to Africa. The beautiful Bolama beach in the west African
country of Guinea Bissau may soon be turned into a scrap yard for
old toxic ships, threatening nature and the lives of local people.
The beach is part of the Bijagos Archipelagos, classified as a
Biosphere Reserve by United Nations (UNESCO). In May we started an
online action to save the Bolama beach. It has already achieved an
initial result: after receiving thousands of messages from
concerned people from all over the world, UNESCO has sent a
research mission to assess the situation. But continued pressure is
necessary to make sure that UNESCO takes effective measures to
protect Bolama Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ams/e?a=766&amp;amp;s=ship"&gt;Send a message now&lt;/a&gt; to stop the nature reserve being turned into a scrap yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;inline_item alt="Shipbreaking web game" border="0" align="left" item_id="50797"&gt;&lt;/inline_item&gt;The
companies behind this plan are some of the bad guys in the murky
world of the shipping industry. To shine a light on the dirty
business of selling ships for shipbreaking, we have developed a
unique new web game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you know &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/shipgame/"&gt;'the tricks
of the trade'&lt;/a&gt;. You are the owner of the old ship "Rubbish
Queen" and you have to get rid of it. Can you make as much profit
as possible? Or do you care for the people and the environment? Try
to do better than most current ship owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;Progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the number of ships for scrap increases. It is
estimated that by 2010, 3000 ships per year will be scrapped. To
pressure the industry to reform we have put 50 ships heading for
scrap under the spotlight. We asked the owners to commit to
cleaning the toxic material from the ships before selling them for
scrapping. Recently the first company from the list,
American/Norwegian ship owner Stolt Nielsen, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/news45.asp"&gt;committed
to prevent future pollution and health threats&lt;/a&gt; associated with
the breaking of ships. The company has a history of dumping
contaminated ships on Indian beaches. This company can prove that
ships can be disposed of without harming the environment and
endangering workers in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Gallon had a brilliant career as an environmentalist, with
the Society for the Promotion of Environmental Conservation (SPEC),
the Environmental Liaison Centre in Nairobi, at Pollution Probe,
and later with the Ontario government. He is probably most well
known lately for The Gallon Environment Letter, a widely
distributed environment and business e-newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gallon's formal involvement with Greenpeace was limited
to the early days in Vancouver, when he loaned us our first "real"
office space, his work and ours overlapped and complemented each
other at various points over the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, Gary Gallon received the Canadian Institute for
Business and Environment's Life Time Achievement Environment
Award.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Turn the page and the forests are Finnished</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/paper-exports-may-finnish-the/</url><text>
	Europe is known more for its ancient cities than ancient forests. And if Finnish paper companies have their way, there may soon be nothing left of the old forests that once covered most of Europe. But Greenpeace activists confronted paper imports in Germany to expose the ongoing destruction of Finland's forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/greenpeace-activists-paint-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/greenpeace-activists-paint-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint 'Forest Crime in Europe' on the hull of a paper carried to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists onboard inflatable boats intercepted the paper carrier "Finn Hawk" as it entered the Baltic Port of Luebeck in Germany. As the Finn Hawk navigated towards its berth, the activists painted "Forest Crime in Europe" on the hull of the ship to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finn Hawk is loaded with paper products from the Finnish paper companies Stora Enso and M-Real; both continue to buy wood for its products from the last of Finland's ancient forests. Other activists on the pier held a banner that read "Forest ministers of Europe: save our ancient forests".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want European ministers to make the right decisions to increase ancient forest protection in Europe during next week's Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe taking place in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after numerous conversations over the last 12 months, the paper companies have taken no real measures to stop the destruction of ancient forests in Finland. In fact, they are peddling their ancient forest destruction to Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few areas of Europe's formerly vast ancient forests still exist in Finland. Less than five percent of the current Finnish forest cover is ancient forest and only half of that is protected from industrial logging and further destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami and other traditional communities. In the north-eastern part of Finland, many ancient forest areas are still unprotected and are being destroyed by the state-owned forest enterprise Metsahallitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main customers for the timber harvested by Metsahallitus are three international paper companies. This ancient forest timber is processed into pulp, magazine grade, fine paper and cardboard in the Finnish paper mills of Stora Enso, UPM Kymmene and M-Real then shipped to destinations in Europe and overseas. The ancient forests ends up as copy paper, envelopes, packaging, and in a range of publications from magazines and newspapers to advertising flyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, very few ancient forests and high conservation value forests are protected in Europe. Greenpeace is calling on European ministers to make real decisions to further the protection of the last ancient forests instead of only stressing sustainable forest management, which can not adequately protect Europe's forests alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure you are not buying products coming from ancient forest destruction, look for the FSC® logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC®, or Forest Stewardship Council™, is an international non-profit organisation that issues certificates for well managed forests and was created so that corporate buyers and individual consumers can identify products coming from responsible forest management. Look for the FSC® logo to the left on wood and paper products to make sure you aren't buying forest destruction or supporting illegal logging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When buying paper products, look closely to make sure they are made from 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper or other agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;
