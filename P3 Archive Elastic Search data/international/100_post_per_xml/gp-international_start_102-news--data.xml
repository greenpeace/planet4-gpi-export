	People across the world took to the streets for a Global Day of Action on Saturday, to tell the governments meeting in Poznan, Poland for crucial UN climate negotiations, that the world is watching them.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists in India, taking part in the 2008 Global Day of Action for the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 23 countries from Australia to Italy to Mexico to the Philippines to Turkey to the US joined or led a series of protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that Ministers arriving in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/un-climate-conference/"&gt; Poznan&lt;/a&gt; listen to the will of their citizens, and get serious about climate action. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YM806Vheo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the action day in Poznan itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world is watching governments in Poznan" said Mareike Britten, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner. "Saturday's actions clearly show that people across the world recognise that it's time for governments to get serious about climate action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a flash mob of people in swimming gear in Amsterdam, to protests in Red Square, Moscow to banner messages on Aztec pyramids in Mexico, to installing solar panels in Thailand, and giving a solar powered Parol (a Filipino Christmas lantern) to the Philippine senate, to a giant postcards reading "Dear World Leaders, we are ready to save the climate" in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, to a boat protest on the Ganga River in India, our map below highlights key Greenpeace activities across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take action! The global day of action is over, but it's not too late for you tell your government you are watching them.

	If we are to avert catastrophic climate change the world must quit coal. But, the industry and the powerful forces which rely on it will not go down without a fight. Today, in Warsaw, Greenpeace, provided them with two reminders of why we should quit coal. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/in-the-run-up-to-the-poznan-co.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tell major global polluters in Poland to "Get Serious, Quit Coal".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists dumped coal on the doorstep of a luxury Warsaw hotel, where industry ministers from 20 countries are meeting to discuss coal's future, unveiling a banner saying 'Get serious, quit coal!'. Greenpeace has also published a report on the "True Cost of Coal": estimating the annual financial costs of coals' climate impact, health impact and the cost of deadly mining accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the Polish Government, the conference documents claim that the meeting is being held to agree on policies to help the climate - but the agenda reveals it is about saving profits, not the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background documents on the 'Summit on Sectoral Cooperation,' describe coal as the main fuel for power generation in the future and discuss "adequate policy actions."  The documents hold up the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as a "spectacular" example of good policy initiatives on climate protection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this partnership is just a coal pact - an agreement by some of the world's leading polluters to do nothing in particular, by no particular time and in no particular way.  In the face of catastrophic climate change that's worse than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Cost of Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with this meeting is the release of our report "The True Cost of Coal", which describes the costs coal imposes on society. Produced in conjunction with the independent Dutch Institute CE Delft, the report puts a price tag on some of the more obvious damages caused along the coal chain-of-custody, including climate change, health impacts from air pollution and loss of life from mining accidents.  Last year, these damages cost the world at least 360 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all the costs of coal can be measured in dollars and cents. In Columbia, indigenous communities are threatened and forced off their lands to make way for coal mines; thousands in Jharia, India, suffer from horrendous living conditions because of uncontrollable coal fires; in Russia, unsafe mining conditions have meant injury and death for scores of workers. We tell twelve of these stories in our report, but there are thousands more to be found wherever coal is mined or burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places like Indonesia, China and Thailand, air pollution from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, damaging ancient relics, reducing crop yields and killing people. The legacy of mining ensures that land in South Africa will continue to be poisoned by acid mine drainage long after mines are closed. Iin the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland, mining activities have caused the water level of Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically. In the United States coal has meant blowing up mountains, burying streams and contaminating nearby communities. In Germany, reclaiming opencast mines has created dead lakes with water as acid as vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in response to the unmitigated destruction and harm caused by coal, communities are rising up.  In Australia, winemakers, horse breeders, local residents and miners are saying no to mine expansion and yes to a just transition to renewable energy.  In the Philippines, a diverse group has united to oppose a new coal-fired power station, calling instead for clean energy development.  Stories such as these inspire, provide hope and point towards a better future - one not marred by dirty coal but fuelled by energy sources that are safe, sustainable and will protect our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is days away from sealing a deal on its own response to climate change, with a series of laws known as the 'climate package', which should provide a boost to renewable energy and reduce Europe's reliance on coal.  The European position will have a massive bearing on global negotiations to strengthen the successor to the Kyoto Protocol, culminating in Copenhagen at the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25082/true-cost-of-coal-report-launc.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poland threatens climate package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is currently threatening to block the EU package. Despite a recent report  showing that implementing the proposed climate package would benefit the Polish economy, vested interests have convinced the Polish government otherwise. Poland generates 90% of its power from burning coal, and the industry has convinced the government that their interests come before those of the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why there won't be any representatives from the renewable industry attending the Sheraton shindig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future without coal is not only possible, it is necessary if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change. The most effective way to do this is for the world to work together under one agreement. Poland, host of the upcoming climate talks, in Poznan, could have designed a meeting to help progress towards an environmentally effective global agreement on climate protection rather than one likely to hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're calling on all countries at the UN climate negotiations next week to get serious and put a meaningful proposal on the table. The proposal must include a "climate vision" which will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40%, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Time To Lead" href="http://www.timetolead.eu/" target="_blank"&gt;Tell EU Leaders to defend the climate package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Representatives of millions of Greenpeace supporters from around the world arrived at the doorstep of the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo today to demand an end to the political persecution of two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, and an end to Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean. Embassy actions are scheduled around the world today and tomorrow. 
&lt;div&gt;

            A "living statue" of Lady justice protests on behalf of Greenpeace in front of the Japanese embassy in The Hague, Netherlands.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-defendants include the chief whale-defenders (officially, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/whaling-on-trial-120508/about-the-co-defendants/"&gt; Executive Directors&lt;/a&gt;) of Greenpeace offices from Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil, USA and the Nordic countries, as well as Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Condemned by Amnesty International&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the group  declared themselves 'co-defendants' in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki. The two Greenpeace activists exposed corruption in the taxpayer-funded whaling industry, but were themselves &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; arrested in a crackdown on Greenpeace itself in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a million Greenpeace supporters wrote to the Prime Minister to demand their release. The arrest was &lt;a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/japan-must-respect-rights-of-detained-greenpeace-activists-20080715" target="_blank"&gt;denounced by Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, and fits a pattern of repression of the rights of free speech in Japan which has been condemned by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group challenged the Prime Minister to set Junichi and Toru free, and end the corrupt whaling programme, or order their own arrest for daring to oppose the whaling programme. 30,000 people have also &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;signed petitions declaring themselves complicit in Junichi and Toru's actions&lt;/a&gt;, and stated that if defending whales is a crime, they too are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want Prime Minister Aso to know that if Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are to be tried for exposing whale meat embezzlement and working to endthe killing of whales in the Japanese Government's 'research' programmein the Southern Ocean, then we should all be arrested," said JunHoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "It's not Greenpeace activists who should be put on trial; it is the government-backed  whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a Greenpeace undercover investigation in May 2008 that exposed the embezzlement of whale meat from the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet, Japanese authorities responded with a politically-motivated prosecution, arresting Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki and raiding the Greenpeace Japan office in June 2008. They have now been awaiting trial for 172 days under bail conditions which prevent hem from continuing their Greenpeace campaign work to end whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to begin early next year; they are both facing upto 10 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-us"&gt;events will be happening throughout today and tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; at Japanese embassies in Brazil, USA, New Zealand, Argentina, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Canada,  Italy and on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, activists declared themselves as 'co-defendants', by asking the Japanese government to "Arrest Me Too" and to put "Whaling on Trial".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proof of life after whaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart, in Tokyo to support the TokyoTwo and the campaign to end Japan's whaling, was a master and gunner atthe Cheynes Beach Whaling Station in Western Australia until it ceasedoperation in 1978 - following Greenpeace protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm here to assure whalers that there is life after whaling. Japan'swhaling programme is a taxpayer-funded government enterprise, so when it finally ends, it's the responsibility of the Japanese government and theFisheries Agency to retrain the crews for other, sustainable, work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Australia alone, 300 million Australian dollars are made every year fromwhalewatching - hundreds of times more than was ever made by the whalingindustry", said Hart. "I am proud of my time at sea, but it was 30 yearsago. Times have changed, and the world has moved on - whaling no longerhas a place in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We're all Junichi and Toru&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know the story of Spartacus? He was the leader of a slave revolt in ancient Rome.  When soldiers put down the uprising, the Romans demanded to know which of the slaves was Spartacus.  One by one, each slave stood up to declare that he was Spartacus, masking their leader's true identiy and declaring their unity with his cause.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can join Junichi and Toru in putting whaling on trial by contributing to our "Spartacus petition."

&lt;h3&gt;Guilty too? Demand your own arrest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If you have ever done anything to oppose Japanese whaling, you're probably guilty in the eyes of the Japanese government of the same crime as Junichi and Toru. Fess up. Sign the petition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Help keep activists like Junichi and Toru working to stop whaling. Help keep our Japanese office running. Help us end whaling forever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	High-tech smuggling operations may not be what you'd normally associate with the ongoing clearance of the Amazon rainforest, but logging companies intent on plundering it for timber have been using hackers to break into the Brazilian government's sophisticated tracking system and fiddle the records.

&lt;p&gt;To monitor the amount of timber leaving the Amazon state of
Pará, the Brazilian environment ministry did away with paper
dockets and two years ago introduced an online system. Companies
logging the rainforest for timber or charcoal production are only
allowed to fell a certain amount of timber every year and this is
controlled by the use of transport permits issued by the state
government's computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be exported from Pará, each shipment of timber requires one
of these transport permits, and the volume of timber in each
shipment is deducted from the total amount allowed under the
company's forest management plan. Once that amount is reduced to
zero, no more transport permits are issued so there's no profit in
felling more trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil, the world's "hacking capital"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what's supposed to happen. But today the public
prosecutor will release details of how hackers employed by 107
logging and charcoal companies have compromised the system,
falsifying online records to increase the timber transport
allocations for certain areas of the forest. In the past, Brazil
has been called the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3657170.stm"&gt;world's
hacking capital&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href="http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;amp;name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;amp;sid=743"&gt;
history of criminal gangs&lt;/a&gt; hacking into bank computer systems to
engage in large-scale online fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hacking has led to 1.7million cubic metres of timber being
illegally smuggled out of Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the Amazon hacking scandal is that nearly 1.7
million cubic metres of illegal timber have been smuggled out of
the Amazon, enough to fill 780 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The
sums of money involved are also huge, and the public prosecutor is
suing the companies responsible for 2 billion reais (US $833m).
According to federal prosecutor Daniel Avelino, many of these
companies have a track record of illegal practices: "Almost half of
the companies involved in this scam have other law suits pending
for environmental crimes or the use of slave labour, amongst other
things."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investigation started in April 2007&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police started investigating the suspect hackers in April 2007,
swooping in a couple of months later to arrest 30 ring leaders. One
is still in jail - the intermediary who brought the hackers and the
loggers together - in total, 202 people are facing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André Muggiati, campaigner in our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/"&gt;Amazon office&lt;/a&gt; in
Manaus, told me they have flagged up potential security holes in
the past. "We've pointed out before that this method of controlling
the transport of timber was subject to fraud. And this is only the
tip of the iceberg, because the same computer system is also used
in two other Brazilian states."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By hacking into the permit system, these companies have made
their timber shipments appear legal and compliant with the forest
management plans. But in reality, they're trading illegal timber
which is making the problem of deforestation worse, and a lack of
control and policing in the areas they're logging means they think
they can get away with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Scandal comes as Brazilian national congress prepares to vote
on forest code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scandal weren't bad enough, it comes as the Brazilian
national congress prepares to vote on a change to the country's
forest code which could massively increase the amount of legal
logging that will be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, land owners in the Amazon are able to clear trees
from 20 per cent of their property but if the proposed changes are
adopted, it will raise that to 50 per cent. Given the contentious
nature of land ownership in the region, no one knows exactly the
damage this will cause but as deforestation rates are once again on
the increase, it's certain to push them up even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil must adopt a zero deforestation plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scandal of loggers and hackers just demonstrates that the
Brazilian government is failing to protect the Amazon forest from
logging companies determined to break the law. If the rainforest is
to have any long-term future, the only answer is to adopt a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt;
zero deforestation plan&lt;/a&gt;, like the one we and other campaign
groups think is needed, setting ambitious targets to bring
deforestation under control. Otherwise illegal logging and
corporate fraud such this will continue to be a massive
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UN climate negotiations begin in Poznan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/un-climate-conference/</url><text>
	It has been a year since governments in Bali pledged to nail down an agreement to save the climate by December 2009. That means they have one year left to agree on how to stop the climate crisis. This year’s UN meeting on Climate Change has just started in Poznan, Poland and we think it is about time for government leaders to stop the talking, get serious and start real negotiations.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real climate action means quitting our addiction to coal. It's time to get serious.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest destruction costs the world economy at least 2 trillion dollars annually. Ocean fish stocks are collapsing, putting a basic source of food for 3 billion people at risk. Droughts and forest fires are destroying our planet's most precious resources and rising sea levels are threatening to displace hundreds of millions of people before the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn't all bad news, the good news is that the solution is pretty simple: to avoid runaway climate change, the world needs to quit its addiction to coal and stop destroying forests - and that work has to start in Poznan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start investing in a future we can all believe in. We need investments in clean, renewable energy and an end to subsidies for dirty and dangerous energy like coal and nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Rescue Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some government leaders have proven that they cannot be trusted to take swift action on climate change based on the facts. From the coal mines of Konin, to the meeting rooms at the UN meetings in Poznan, we are taking action to make sure that government leaders know it is time to get serious about climate change and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  &lt;a title="QUIT COAL" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/"&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/a&gt; has set up a &lt;a title="CLIMATE RESCUE STATION" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/climate-rescue/"&gt;Climate Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; in Konin, Poland- one hour form the UN meeting - to highlight the true cost of coal in the lead up to crucial UN climate negotiations. The Rescue Station is currently set up on the edge of an open pit coal mine where activists have been demanding an end to our addiction to coal in a series of direct actions. On 8 December, a week into the talks, the dome will be moved to Poznan town square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that the truth is heard at the UN meetings, we've also sent a team of climate experts to Poznan. We are there to pressure governments to quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate. Our message to delegates is simple - it's time to get serious about tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not just another meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year doesn't seem like a lot of time to most of us, considering the scope of the problem. After two decades of climate negotiations, governments are still tip-toeing around each other when it comes to real solutions to climate change. This year the world is watching the UN negotiations and demanding that governments make good on their promise to come up with an action plan in Copenhagen next year. Be a part of the action and &lt;a title="THE WORLD IS WATCHING" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;upload your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the UN meeting in Poznan, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's what we need from our leaders in Poznan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Developed countries must agree greenhouse gas emission reduction targets at the upper end of 25-40%, as identified by the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Make sure government leaders know that The World is Watching and we expect them to commit to a climate deal at next year's talks in Copenhagen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely donations from individuals like you. We don't accept money from governments of corporations.Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Sending out an SOS for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tuna-sos-081208/</url><text>
	Our activists together with Korean environmental group KFEM created a huge human "SOS Tuna" banner on the shores of a beach in Busan, Korea, as a key regional meeting in Korea began this week. This extremely critical meeting will decide the fate of valuable tuna stocks in the Pacific, which are now seriously threatened due to overfishing. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Time and tuna are running out!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific ocean is rich in marine life and home to over 20 IslandNations. Today, the Pacific supplies over 6 percent of the world's tuna. Butoverfishing in other areas of the world means more and more boats aremoving in, and chasing fewer and fewer fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge industrial tuna boats, capable of catching as many tuna in onetrip as some of the countries are able to take in a year, areplundering this vulnerable region at a rate that means trouble for thetuna as well as the people whose livelihoods and futures depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These boats originate from countries like Korea, Japan and Taiwan andfeed the ever-increasing appetites for tuna in the luxury Asian, European and US markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not just about saving some fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lives and economies of Pacific Islanders and Pacific Island nations are in peril as big eye and yellow fin tuna stocks are threatened from overfishing. Pacific communities are at the mercy of unscrupulous foreign fishersand our growing global appetite for tuna is in the grip of unfair andunsustainable fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on delegates at this week's Western and CentralPacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting in Korea to implement measures fora sustainable and profitable fishing industry. TheWCPFC must start putting words into action byagreeing on strong and effective measures. A precautionary and ecosystem-based approach isneeded to preserve the rich marine diversity of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce, protect and reject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be an immediate halving offishing, a closure to fishing in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt; the high seas pockets&lt;/a&gt; and an immediatehalt to the transfer of fish at sea to discourage piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCPFC must ensure decisions are not hijacked againby a small minority of nations that are not acting in the best interestof Pacific people, their valuable tuna resources andthe health of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one last chance to ensure the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks do notface the same fate as bluefin tuna of the Mediterranean. The Commission has to be preparedto face the consequences if negotiations break down to governments andindustry ruthlessly bargaining for the last tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship, the Esperanza, is present in Korea to bear witness tothe WCPFC's decisions, which will dictate the future of Pacific tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea should lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have joined forces with Korean environmental group KFEM to ensure that Korea, as the host nation and key player in the fishery, takes the lead in making sure that this meeting takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need marine reserves which will fully protect the most vulnerable breeding grounds of the tuna from exploitation. We need sustainable management measures outside those areas that will secure a future for this fishery and for the future of the millions of Pacific island people that depend on this resource for their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow we need marine reserves today. Join the call for a global network of marine reserves protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to attend meetings like this one in Korea to pressure governments who need to make the right decisions to protect our planet. We don't take any corporate or government donations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The final outcome of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is too weak to stop overfishing of Pacific bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Pacific islanders are still at great risk from the collapse of this fishery. But the decision to close two of the high seas pockets, between Pacific Island countries, to purse seine fishing from 2010 has left them with a shred of hope.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will also consider the closure of a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
third high seas area&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. We have been campaigning for
these areas to be designated as marine reserves &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/where-are-the-pacific-tuna/"&gt;
since 2004&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, our ship, Esperanza, patrolled these high seas areas
for over ten weeks. During this time we took action againstfishing
fleets from &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;
Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-demonstra"&gt;
Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3"&gt;
US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pacific-pirate-busted100508/"&gt;
Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support sustainable fisheries, protect marine life
and clean up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; in the region - &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning since 2001 that the bigeye and
yellowfin stocks in the Pacific are in decline and recommended a
minimum 30 percent reduction in fishing for 2009. Yet the
commission only agreed to cut fishing on bigeye tuna with a range
of measures including a 10 percent reduction for longliners
only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25073/greenpeace-activists-from-fiji.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Greenpeace activists from Fiji and
Papua New Guinea stand on juvenileyellowfin and skipjack tuna in
the hold of a vessel that was caughtoffloading fish from purse
seiners in the Pacific Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuna exterminators strike back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Island countries, and the US
all put up a strong front to save the Pacific tuna. But resistance
from Japan, Korea, China, Chinese Taipei and the Philippines meant
that fishing will not be reduced enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nations, with a huge appetite for tuna, resisted moves to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, despite strong
economic arguments. Recent studies indicate that the fishing
industry is undermining its own profits by having too many fishing
vessels on the water and by depleting stocks to the point that fish
are harder to catch. We've been calling for a precautionary 50
percent fishing reduction in order to ensure both the long term
sustainability and profitability of the fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just add water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than protecting their fishing future - these
shortsighted governments are sending entire species into oblivion.
As usual consensus based decision making ensured that many
agreements were diluted to the lowest common denominator -
determined only by short term interests. The needs of the Pacific
Island States, whose livelihoods and economies depend on tuna, have
been neglected yet again - despite members of the fishing industry
calling upon these nations to follow the advice of scientists and
reduce fishing by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets and marine reserves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save fish for the future we're now calling on
retailers and fish purchasers  to stop buying all overfished
bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as well as skipjack caught using
fish aggregation devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also continuing to push for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of fully protected marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; covering 40
percent of our oceans. This will help to; buffer our seas from the
ravages of climate change, restore the health of fish stocks and
protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Thanks to donations from individuals like you - we are able to support the Pacific islanders who are trying to preserve their way of life and economies.

	The nuclear industry has had fifty years of massive subsidies and state help – but has delivered only unsafe, expensive power, contamination and waste that will last for thousands of generations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mickey Mouse climate solutions
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, over 350 non-governmental organisations including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF told delegates at the UN climate talks that nuclear power is not a climate solution but a dangerous distraction from investment in renewable power and energy efficiency. Representing millions of members in 48 countries, the organisations have proclaimed nuclear power a "Mickey Mouse climate solution" and delivered a global call to keep it out of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to pass up the chance of ever more state support and win more taxpayers' money, the nuclear industry is presenting itself as a practical solution to climate change. One of the privileges this dirty and dying industry wants now is to become eligible for support under Kyoto Treaty mechanisms. If that goes through, a country such as France could finance the construction of a reactor in a developing country by a French firm - giving money to its own companies and claiming "emission allowances" for itself so that it doesn't have to reduce its own domestic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to include nuclear power in the Kyoto Protocol CDM is currently being discussed at the UN Climate talks in Poznan These talks coincide with a run of bad news for the nuclear industry that makes its claims of clean cheap power even harder to justify. Following the news of soaring costs for the European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) in &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/epr_history_repeating_costs_up.html"&gt; France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/the_financial_times_finlands_s.html"&gt; Finland&lt;/a&gt; and  in the estimated budgets for &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/dont_believe_the_hype.html"&gt; reactors planned in the US&lt;/a&gt;, came the news that South-Africa - till now seen as one of the most promising candidates for a so-called nuclear "renaissance" - &lt;a title="Nukes out of Africa" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/non_merci_areva_is_out_of_afri.html"&gt;is backing off for a while&lt;/a&gt;: the planned French reactors are simply too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented its pro-nuclear case in Poznan last week, we were there to confront them with reality. And the IAEA had no defence other than to say that things would get better in the future! This is something that we and our parents have been hearing for fifty years now. The IAEA needs to stop dreaming - the climate will not wait and we need to get serious about combating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bring some facts to the debate, Greenpeace has prepared &lt;a title="Facts on Nuclear Power" href="/international/PageFiles/25075/getting-serious-about-nuclear.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Together with other NGOs, we also organised our own official "side event" in Poznan - a specialised session that exposed the facts behind the nuclear "renaissance" smokescreen: nuclear power has been in decline in recent years, with more reactors being closed than built; escalating costs combined with the recent financial crisis are having a devastating effect on the nuclear industry's reputation with financial institutions and bankers. We were delighted to see a crowd of over 100 press and country delegates getting detailed facts on the poor performance of the nuclear industry, something the nuclear industry has been trying to hide from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This side event alone isn't going to stop the nuclear lobby trying to sneak in by the backdoor to get its grubby hands on climate mitigation funding. But it's clear there's a very depressed mood in the nuclear industry's camp, and that negotiators and press from all over the whole world are beginning to understand that the nuclear "renaissance" hype is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Tell governments the world is watching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EXPOSED! Pirates bankrolled by Spanish government</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-pirates-bankrolled-by/</url><text>
	We've just presented evidence to the Fisheries Committee of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) that the Spanish company Vidal Armadores S. A., despite being involved in pirate fishing, received over 3.5 million Euros in Spanish government subsidies. On top of that, the company is still getting help from the Spanish government in securing contracts and licences to fish in other countries. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real pirates get punished, right? Aarrgh, not in Spain, matey! There they get subsidised.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;Pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; - known by its less colourful name: illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing -&lt;/span&gt; costs the world US$4 billion annually and &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;leaves communities that depend on fish without much needed food and income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;In the Southern Pacific, pirate fishing for the prized Patagonia toothfish (also known as "sea bass") has driven the species to the brink of commercial extinction. &lt;/span&gt;Illegal fleets catching the remaning toothfish here are predominantly controlledby northern hemisphere transnational crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off the radar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is currently running a fleet of at least five vessels in the Southern Ocean, at least three of which are blacklisted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Commission - part of the Antarctic TreatySystem - manages fishing activities in the Southern Ocean. It blacklists vessels for engaging in pirate activity or failing to respect conservation measures, and the 24 member states agree not to buy fish from blacklisted vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a blacklisted vessel transfers its catch at sea to another ship, who is to know? In 2007, CCAMLR estimated that pirate vessels caught more than 3600 tonnes of toothfish and killed more than 8000 seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, New Zealand inspectors documented that the Namibian-flagged &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/0/vessel/show/156-paloma-v"&gt;Paloma V&lt;/a&gt; had been involved in &lt;a href="http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Features/945-Illegal-Fishing-activities.php"&gt; illegal transshipments&lt;/a&gt;. It was blacklisted by CCAMLR as a result. The inspection revealed that the vessel was operating together with other ships in the Vidal fleet including the blacklisted North Korean-flagged Chilbo San 33 and Black Moon, as well as the Spanish-flagged Belma and Galaecia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Spain signed an agreement with Namibia in 2008 that gave the Belma access to Namibian fishing grounds, and has provided Vidal Armadores with other assistance in securing contracts and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hook them and book them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on all countries participating in the Committee on Fisheries in Rome to take the evidence presented to them seriously and urgently work towards closing the loopholes that these operators use to avoid controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is not alone - fishing companies around the world use transshipments and loopholes to evade the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need bodies like the UN FAO to support strong regulations involving the ports that these ships enter, create a global record of fishing vessels and to urgently reduce commercial fishing to a sustainable level. It is simply a matter of political will to deliver the kind of enforcement that is needed to protect the marine environment and the communities which depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the case of Vidal Armadores, we want to see the Spanish government take real action to stop ocean plunder - they can start by asking for their subsidies back. Then they can prosecute any Spanish nationals that were captains or masters of the ships. Then they can revoke all Vidal Armadores' licenses and stop helping them get contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves to protect the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Three hundred and forty Greenpeace activists were arrested as they took their demand to "Bail out the Planet" to European Union finance ministers in Brussels. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Hundreds of activists were arrested as they demanded EU finance ministers "Bail out the planet."
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked the exits of the building where the ministers
were meeting, and demanded an answer on the climate funding
question. Swarms of uniformed officers, riot police and
plain-clothed cops descended on the activists as a line of black
armoured vehicles, police vans and busses moved in to block the
public view of the activist-guarded doors. Electric saws were used
to cut through the locks and police dragged activists face down
into the line of police vehicles. It took the police more than two
hours to remove all of the peaceful activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the men and women of EU finance met to discuss the financial
crisis and the climate crisis, we asked a question: where is the
money to avert runaway climate change? Because it looks to us like
there's far more interest in bailing out banks then in bailing out
a planet headed toward a bankrupt future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions made today by EU finance ministers are important
because they will directly influence Europe's position at the
historic UN climate summit in Copenhagen this December. Richer
developed countries need to contribute at least €110 billion a year
by 2020 to make sure developing countries are able to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable
impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country's contribution towards a climate bailout plan is
based on its ability to pay and its level of responsibility in
causing climate change. Based on this, the  European governments'
share is €35 billion a year by 2020, the equivalent of just €1.30 a
week per European citizen: the price of a bus ticket.  To help
raise these funds, we are supporting a new scheme that puts a price
tag on greenhouse gas emissions and asks rich countries to pay for
their carbon footprint according to their means and their
responsibility for causing the climate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

their were no serious injuries sustained. View video from the

<item><language>en</language><title>India's light bulb phase out: setting a smart example</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/india-light-bulb-phaseout-250209/</url><text>
	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	Shameless. Disastrous. The international body responsible for "managing" what's left of the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna stock has ignored scientific advice, the demands of Greenpeace supporters around the world, and the pleas of the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa and the United States to save the fishery from collapse.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Captive Bluefin Tuna inside a transport cage.Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the Mediterranean to protect bluefin tuna with marine reserves in their breeding and feeding areas.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt;Bluefin tuna is highlyprized in Asian markets as sushi, and overfishing has decimated thestocks. Bluefin are slow to mature and many young tuna are caughtbefore they have the chance to reproduce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greenpeace and other environmental groups have called for the closure of the bluefin tuna fisheries, to give them time to recover. But the governments responsible for managing the fishery are refusing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), concluded in Marrakech with an agreement allowing over 22,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna to be landed -- around 7,500 tonnes over the level recommended by scientists to avoid the collapse of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last-chance tuna bazaar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fall under the 'management' of ICCAT, a body made up of government representation from 45 countries plus the European Community.&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But this year's session looked more like a bazaar, in which buyers haggled over the last remaining tuna, than an international meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management plan they agreed to fails to protect the spawning population and merely shortens  the purse seine fishing season, responsible for the bulk of illegal catches, by 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union, representing the majority of Mediterranean countries with interests in the bluefin tuna fishery, bullied other parties in the meeting into agreeing to management proposals which completely fail to follow the advice of ICCAT's own scientific body to substantially reduce fishing and protect the species' spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure from the European countries has been so strong that they have even managed to slow downthe 'payback' for the illegal catches made in the region in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Time for new management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"The game is over - ICCAT has missed its last chance to save the bluefin tuna from stock collapse," said Sebastian Losada, Greenpeace Spain Oceans Campaigner, who has been attending the Marrakech meeting. "Bluefin tuna has become an endangered species because of ICCAT mismanagement. It's time to take the fishery out of their hands and look to Conventions like CITES to impose trade restrictions on thespecies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"These past seven days have demonstrated that ICCAT is a farce," said Losada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;In 2006, following years of extremely high levels of pirate fishing, among others by European Union fishing vessels, ICCAT agreed a bluefin tuna "recovery plan" that set a 'Total Allowable Catch' of 29,500 tonnes for the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;ICCAT's own Scientific Committee recommended a sustainable limit of 15,000 tonnes. Since then, the very same scientists have estimated that actual bluefin tuna catches were about 61,000 tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; Greenpeace demanded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; a closure of the fishery&lt;/a&gt; until a proper recovery plan is inplace including at a very minimum a Total Allowed Catch (TAC) in line with the scientific advice, a seasonal closure covering the months of May, June and July and the establishment of marine reserves to protect the bluefin tuna spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Disgrace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the main fishing countries such as Spain and France, which currently leads the Union of 27 Member States, should bear the brunt of the criticism for this shameful outcome. They have again placed short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species, and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently released performance review of ICCAT written by a panel of experts appointed by ICCAT itself recommended&lt;em&gt; "the suspension of fishing on bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" and&lt;/em&gt; states that "&lt;em&gt;the management ... of this bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is widely seen as an international disgrace.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, ICCAT has lived up to that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.  Join the call to protect 40 percent of our world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Peaceful protesters from the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station were attacked by mine workers when they entered the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine. As the activists prepared to paint a huge "Stop" sign next to a giant excavator they were assaulted and prevented from carrying out their peaceful protest. A journalist accompanying the activists was beaten. Local people are also against the expansion of this mine, because it threatens their homes and livelihoods.

            The Climate Rescue Station overlooks the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our action is not against the miners but it is addressed to the Polish government. We demand that the forthcoming Polish energy policy contain a concrete plan for quitting coal and implementing renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also object to opening any new power plants working for lignite. Lignite is the most destructive fuel," says Magdalena Zowsik, Climate and Energy Campaigner in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists at the mine are part of the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station, which was set up two weeks ago at the edge of the mine to bear witness to the destruction and environmental devastation caused by coal. Just last week 400 members of local communities whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by the mine joined us in a peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More then 90 percent of energy in Poland is produced by burning coal, but it doesn't have to be that way. The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution scenario for Poland shows how Poland can make the transition to generating 80 percent of its power using renewable sources. That would mean an end to the destructive mining and devastated countryside that scars Poland. It would also mean Poland would cease to be one of the twenty largest emitters of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland's addiction to coal doesn't just harm its environment, it also drives its role in international talks. With the EU just days away form sealing a deal on a response to climate change Poland is actively trying to water down the package so it can carry on polluting. With Poland also due to host the UN Climate Negotiations on December 1 it is essential that Poland adopts a progressive attitude toward the talks and make itself part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Poland and the world need an energy revolution, not more of the same," adds Zowsik. "The science is unequivocal, if we try to continue burning coal we will do untold damage to the planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, Greenpeace wants to see governments agree a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40 percent cuts, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by the time the next round of climate talks begin in Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Stop nuclear madness, end MOX shipments now </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stop-nuclear-madness-no-more/</url><text>
	The largest shipment of deadly plutonium in history is about to leave the French port of Cherbourg - final destination Japan. We’ve taken action to send the message that this is yet another glaring example of the unacceptable risks posed by nuclear energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A target symbol projected onto a truck loaded with plutonium in MOX fuel. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists in France have tracked the shipment which contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in Mixed-Oxide (MOX) fuel. This is enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated &lt;a href="http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/na-bomb/museum/museume01.html"&gt; Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've demonstrated with distress flares and "Stop Plutonium" banners at the Cherbourg port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We projected a "target" symbol and "Nuclear Madness made in France" onto the nearby state owned AREVA reprocessing plant in La Hague, where the MOX was produced. Our activists also projected the same messages onto the trucks carrying the deadly cargo to Cherbourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our position is simple. The world needs an immediate ban on MOX shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ships, the Pacific Heron and Pacific Pintail will be used to transport the radioactive cargo. They will leave on March 6, just after departure AREVA will reveal which route the deadly waste will take to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mox - a deadly fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest dangers of plutonium is that it can be used to make nuclear weapons. MOX increases the dangers of nuclear proliferation, as the plutonium in it is easier to extract for weapons use than plutonium in spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also plenty of evidence showing that the containers used to transport the MOX are not strong enough to withstand serious accidents or terrorist attack. Risk of fire is just one example, the containers are only tested over a few hours, but fires on board ships can last much longer (days or even weeks).  Once MOX fuel disperses it poses a grave threat to public health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a plutonium shipment in 2002, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda stated "our small states are fearful that a deliberate act of terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence. This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all this, it is little wonder that plutonium and MOX shipments have been opposed by dozens of governments and their citizens, since they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AREVA is denying the risks of proliferation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AREVA denies that there is any proliferation risk by claiming a false distinction between "military grade" and "civil grade" nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) thinks differently classifying commercial plutonium MOX fuel as Category 1 nuclear material, requiring the highest level of security protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the world now has more weapons usable plutonium in civil nuclear programmes than in all nuclear weapons arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the Japan's Citizens Nuclear Information Center and Green Action organisations we've &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/Open-letter-ElBaradei"&gt; written to Mohammed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, head of the IAEA warning him that AREVA is either dangerously confused, or is deliberately misrepresenting the proliferation threat posed by the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also sent &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/open-letter-en-route-countries/"&gt; letters to the governments&lt;/a&gt; of  countries that may be en route, warning them of the potential dangers to their populations and environment; and urging them to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/3/mox-map-route.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25048/moxmap-thumb.jpg" alt="moxmap.jpg" width="430" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The most likely route of the MOX shipment is via South Africa and across the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia, and through the coastal waters of South Pacific nations. Other possible routes are via the Caribbean and Panama Canal or via South America and Cape Horn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan has been failing to use MOX for their nuclear reactors for over a decade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has been trying to use MOX in their nuclear reactors for more than ten years; and have repeatedly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shipment to Japan in 1999 ended in fiasco after the producer, UK state company British Nuclear Fuels, admitted it had deliberately falsified vital quality control safety data. After an 18,000-mile voyage, the rejected fuel was shipped back to the UK. Two more cargoes, one delivered in 1999, the other in 2001, were opposed by local citizens and regional governments. Both shipments remain in storage with no prospect that they will ever be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough already, stop the Nuclear madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as though anything has changed. Shipping MOX remains as dangerous as ever. Governments across the world have recognised the threat and in 2005 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/MIM/A-conf.207-L.6-Mauritius%20Declaration.pdf"&gt; a moratorium on all nuclear transports&lt;/a&gt; was tabled at a UN summit. It's time to make that resolution a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the best efforts of the nuclear industry to convince us otherwise, the simple truth is that you can't separate "civil" nuclear from nuclear used for weapons. They are two parts of the same extremely dangerous whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for industry claims that nuclear power can be used in the fight against climate change, the opposite is true. Nuclear power is too little, too late, too dangerous. In fact, it &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25048/nuclear-power-undermining-cl.pdf"&gt; undermines the true solutions to climate change&lt;/a&gt; by diverting urgently needed resources away from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be following the MOX shipment on our &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/"&gt;nuclear reaction blog&lt;/a&gt;, sign up for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Hazardous waste, illegitimate and dangerous new reactors and a diversion to the solutions to climate change - here's why France's picture of nuclear energy is just a 'great illusion'.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace in action at the construction site of the European Pressurised Reactor in Flamanville, France. Greenpeace is demanding an immediate end to construction at both Flamanville and Europe's other EPR site at Olkiluoto, Finland, calling the plants dangerous, unnecessary and uneconomic.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the French government's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) as cheap and safe, nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity, and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever-increasing problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has recently uncovered evidence that nuclear waste from the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) - the flagship of the French nuclear industry - will be up to &lt;strong&gt;seven times more hazardous&lt;/strong&gt; than waste produced by existing nuclear reactors, increasing costs and the danger to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming evidence was buried away in the &lt;a href="http://www.posiva.fi/publications/Posiva_YVA_selostusraportti_en_lukittu.pdf"&gt; environmental impact assessment report&lt;/a&gt; from Posiva, the company responsible for managing waste at the world's first EPR under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland, and in &lt;a href="http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e_ntb04-08.pdf"&gt; EU-funded research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expensive and hazardous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR is designed to extract more energy from nuclear fuel than any commercially operating reactor in order to maximise electricity output. This "high burn-up" method causes the amount of readily-released radioactive substances in spent fuel to increase disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of the hazardous waste will be more costly for a range of reasons - including an increase in the repository size due to the greater distance needed between canisters, more extensive and longer-term monitoring being necessary, and increased security being required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…not only will spent nuclear fuel produced by the EPR be more dangerous than is acknowledged by the French nuclear industry, but also storage and disposal will be more expensive than the industry and governments proclaim and will increase the overall cost of nuclear energy. The French nuclear companies Areva and EDF, which aggressively market the EPR as safe and cheap, have completely ignored the implications of the increased &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;hazards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Large, independent nuclear consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No appropriate waste facilities exist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- or are even being planned - in Finland, France or any of the countries considering buying the EPR (including the UK, the US, Canada and India). In Finland, plans for burying the nuclear waste that are awaiting approval are simply inadequate for preventing interim and long-term health risks, and will pass on huge financial liabilities to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Illegitimate and dangerous"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR construction project in Olkiluoto has been &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-the-french-reactor/"&gt; hampered by all manner of chronic problems, delays and cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposed to have been completed by April 2009, but now faces at least three years' delay - its cost has doubled to over €5 billion and serious construction and safety problems have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same mistakes have plagued a second EPR construction at Flamanville, France, which started just over a year ago. It too is now delayed - by nine months at present - and is already running at over 20 percent of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, President Sarkozy &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/illegitimate-and-dangerous-reactor-300109/"&gt; announced last week that a new EPR is to be built in Penly&lt;/a&gt;, France. Greenpeace believes that building yet another reactor under these circumstances is entirely illegitimate and simply dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penly decision was taken without any public consultation, open bidding or analysis of energy needs. No other options, such as energy efficiency or renewable energy potential, were considered, no comparisons were made in terms of costs, environmental impacts or needs; in fact, the official study analysing France's electricity needs beyond 2020 is still ongoing, so there is nothing to justify the decision to pour vast amounts of money into building another problematic reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its only justification is to provide a massive contract to the state-owned industry. In these times of fiscal crisis, however, it is crucial to make the right choices: and investment instead in renewable energy would provide not only climate protection and cleaner energy, but more and better jobs and a truly sustainable state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The great illusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when France is setting itself up as the political and industrial champion of a supposed worldwide expansion of nuclear power, Global Chance - an  association that includes among its members several of France's few independent nuclear experts - has produced a report that shows how France's nuclear promises are a dangerous illusion. France is locked into nuclear power in a way that presents an obstacle to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Chance report shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France's nuclear programme fails to rise to the challenges of climate change and energy security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France has not benefited economically from their 'all electric, all nuclear' approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how nuclear power is liable to suffer serious accidents - whether due to system failure, natural disaster or deliberate attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how no satisfactory solution has been found for the management of long-term waste; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France contributes to proliferation, which remains a major risk for global security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace briefing &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/frances-nuclear-failures-report/"&gt; &lt;em&gt;France's Nuclear Failures - The great illusion of nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; summarises the lessons that can be drawn from the Global Chance report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy [R]evolution!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is nothing more than an out-of-date, expensive and failed technology from the last century. It undermines the solutions to climate change by diverting urgently-needed resources away from the true renewable and energy-efficiency solutions that governments who are serious about climate change need to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy [R]evolution blueprint&lt;/a&gt; shows that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency can deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050 and ensure that people have a clean energy future that is free from the dangers of hazardous nuclear waste.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="Mato Grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/location-of-mato-grosso-in-the/"&gt;Location of Mato Grasso in the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="deforestation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/deforestation-in-the-brazilian/"&gt;Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="cattle ranching expansion" href="/international/en/publications/reports/cattle-ranching-expansion-in-t/"&gt;Cattle ranching expansion in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="original vegatation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/original-vegetation-in-thestat/"&gt;Original Vegetation in the State of Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="slauterhouses and roads in mato grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughterhouses-and-roads-in-m/"&gt;Slaughterhouses and Roads in Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;For the sake of biodiversity, indigenous peoples' rights and the climate, I support Greenpeace's call to cut emissions – not trees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Undercover operation exposes illegal dumping of e-waste in Nigeria </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-nigeria180209/</url><text>
	Following a three-year undercover investigation, we’ve shown once again that electronic waste - like your old TV set - still isn't being responsibly recycled like it's supposed to be. Instead, e-waste is being disguised as second-hand goods and shipped off to Nigeria, where it is sold, scrapped or illegally dumped. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            E-waste is one of the fastest growing types of hazardous waste with up to 80 percent of e-waste from Europe failing to be disposed of safely
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover operation, carried out with the help of &lt;a title="Sky News" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Sky-Probe-Reveals-Recycling-Scandal-As-Broken-TVs-Are-Shipped-Over-To-West-Africa/Article/200902315224628?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15224628_Sky_Probe_Reveals_Recycling_Scandal_As_Broken_TVs_Are_Shipped_Over_To_West_Africa"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt;, is further evidence of the growing trade in hazardous waste from Europe to the developing world due to  electronic companies' failure to take responsibility for recycling their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on a tip-off, we launched our operation to see just where some electronic waste was ending up. We took an unfixable TV, fitted it with a tracking device and brought it to the UK's Hampshire County Council for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being safely dismantled in the UK or Europe, like it should have been, the Council's 'recycling' company, BJ Electronics, passed it on as 'second-hand goods' and it was shipped off to Nigeria to be sold or scrapped and dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following the e-waste trail - a Greenpeace investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's illegal to export broken electronic goods under EU legislation - at no point before it was crammed into a container with similar TVs and shipped off was the TV turned on or tested to see if it was in working condition. We followed the complete e-waste trafficking route by hiding a tracking device inside the TV that provided location updates via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/02/illegal_ewaste_export_to_niger.html"&gt; Read more&lt;/a&gt; about how exactly we tracked the TV all the way to Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, like &lt;a title="Ghana" href="/international/en/news/features/poisoning-the-poor-electroni/"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Pakistan" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/scrap-life-pakistan-with-rob"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="India" href="/international/en/publications/reports/recyclingelectronicwasteindiachinafull/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="China" href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-e-waste-exposed140708/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, is just one of many destinations that Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other developed countries are using as toxic e-waste dumping grounds. For years, we've been exposing the mountains of e-waste that show up on the doorstep of developing countries at the expense of people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest people, in many cases children, are put to work breaking apart TVs, mobile phones, game consoles and other electronic items that arrive in their tonnes. With no safety measures, they are exposed to highly toxic chemicals, including mercury, which damages the brain; lead, which can damage reproductive systems; and cadmium, which causes kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is your e-waste going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we were able to track the e-waste from door to door, exposing the loopholes in recycling programmes that allow illicit profits to be made by the developed world's traders by dumping their obsolete and hazardous electronics abroad instead of properly recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of old electronic goods and components leave the EU for Africa every day, despite regulations prohibiting the trade in e-waste. Some will be repaired and reused, but many are beyond repair, meaning that they will eventually be dumped in places where no facilities exist for safe recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by making sure their goods are free from hazardous components. We need them to take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that poison people and the environment across the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need companies to introduce voluntary take-back schemes and remove hazardous substances from their products so they can be recycled safely and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing evidence of the harm caused by toxic e-waste, many companies are still failing to prioritise the removal of toxic chemicals and delaying taking full responsibility for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="The Independent" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/dumped-in-africa-britain8217s-toxic-waste-1624869.html"&gt;Check out the&lt;/a&gt; coverage of the undercover investigation at The Independent.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>First fin whales killed in Iceland </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/first-fin-whales-killed-in-ice/</url><text>
	The whaling boat Hvalur 9 dragged two massive fin whales up to the ancient whaling station ramp at Hvalförður in the early hours. If it were not for Iceland’s midnight sun the whalers would have been sneaking in under the cover of the night – a scene befitting the shameful hunt that can only do untold damage to Iceland’s reputation.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            June 19, 2009 HVALFJORDUR-FJORD, ICELANDWhaling in Iceland. First fin whales brought to land on June 19, 2009. The boat, Hvalur 9, entering Hvalfjordur-fjord. The first fin whale to be cut was a female, 18 metres long.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales were killed on Friday morning, just days before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings begin in Madeira, Portugal. The start of the hunt was clearly intended to deride efforts to modernise the Commission and stop the needless slaughter of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales are the first of 150 fin whales Icelandic whaler Kristjan Loftsson plans to hunt this year, despite having no domestic market for the meat and &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/no-market-for-icelandic-whale/"&gt; no interest from importers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The hunt is part of a 5 year whaling programme agreed by the former Icelandic government, just hours before it collapsed earlier this year. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists fin whales as an endangered species globally that requires special protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland's new government "fallen asleep" on the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland's new government under Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir has openly voiced its opposition to whaling. Yet, by failing to stop the hunt it appears to have fallen asleep on the issue and allowed the whalers to dictate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has not only failed to stop the controversial fin whale hunt from going ahead. It is also failing to stop a hunt of minke whales that started in May. Shockingly, the minkes are being hunted in the same areas as those visited by whale watching trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not taking action to stop the hunts, the new government risks squandering a real chance to save Iceland's environmental and international reputation, as well as hopes for speedy accession to the pro-conservation Europe Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No market for whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no domestic whale meat market in Iceland. Loftsson justifies the hunt by promising to sell the meat to Japan, claiming it can help Iceland recover from its economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently showed that this is absolute hogwash, when we released audio and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fact-sheet-the-whale-meat-mar/"&gt; an English transcript&lt;/a&gt; of a very interesting conversation we had with the Japanese trader who imported fin and minke whale meat from Iceland and Norway last year. The head of the Asia Trading Company in Tokyo told us very clearly that he will not take any more in the future, because there is no market for the whale meat in Japan. In fact, he only took it last year as a favour to Loftsson because he is a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland hunt starts on eve of IWC meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fin whale hunt has started just before the IWC meets in Madeira, Portugal. The blatant disregard displayed by the Icelandic whalers for international agreements, economics and the environment is a prime example of why the IWC needs to put its own house in order and become an effective conservation body that works for whales, not whalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a perfect setting for such change. In 1981, Portugal moved to protect all whales and dolphins throughout its territories, ending the island's long association with whaling. Madeira's fast-growing whale watching industry proves once again that whales are worth much more alive than dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icleand is well positioned to follow this example. More than 115,000 people have already taken our Iceland Pledge, saying they would visit the country, and go whale watching, if the government ends whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/d65e0c9134ba47f382c627f685a3589f.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Tell Iceland's government to save the whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Help keep us fighting for whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace – Yes Men spoof newspaper declares climate deal </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iht-se/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish Prime Minister takes step towards EU leadership at UN Climate Summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/TuskCopenhagen04062009/</url><text>
	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon destruction not such a good look </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/slaughteringtheamazon-160609/</url><text>
	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Justice for the Tokyo Two - justice for whales, coming our way?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/justice-for-the-tokyo-two-ju/</url><text>
	Justice is starting to go the Tokyo Two way: A court in Aomori, Japan, has delivered a series of setbacks to the prosecution in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki (the activists known as the Tokyo Two) - and the Japanese government's attempts to cover up an embezzlement scandal within the whaling industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan Campaigns Director Junichi Sato faces up to ten years in prison for exposing corruption in the whaling industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the court has ruled that evidence of the embezzlement scandal cannot be excluded. Second, the issue of whether or not Junichi and Toru's actions are protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can and will be discussed during the trial. Third, the court has requested that the prosecutor come forward with witness testimonies that may prove crucial to the case - and to further disclose evidence of the whale meat scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor had previously been attempting to portray the actions of Junichi and Toru as being a simple case of theft, and to block any discussion of the embezzlement. The court has rightly refused to accept this, ruling that this evidence cannot be excluded - evidence which details the exposure by Junichi and Toru of a major corruption scandal within the Japanese government-sponsored Southern Ocean whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru risk up to ten years in jail if convicted of theft. They removed a box of embezzled whale meat from a mail depot last year, and presented it to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor, who immediately opened up an investigation into corruption in the government-subsidised whaling programme. The investigation was later discontinued - on the same day that Junichi and Toru were arrested, and the Greenpeace Japan office raided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has urged the prosecutor to disclose evidence that he's been holding back. This includes statements made to police by the "owner" of the intercepted box of whale meat;  by several individuals who purportedly entrusted their whale meat to him, and by an employee of whaling fleet operator Kyodo Senpaku, who made the arrangements to transport the crewmembers' "personal luggage" from the ship to their homes. If that sounds murky, it's probably because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this trial, we want to establish that what Junichi and Toru did was to corroborate information provided by whistleblowers regarding embezzlement within the Kyodo Senpaku whaling fleet," said the Tokyo Two's defence lawyer, Yuichi Kaido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the prosecutor's opinion being rejected by the court, we have gained a foothold in this case and the opportunity to prove that there was indeed embezzlement of whale meat by employees."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that prosecutor's attempts to keep the whale meat scandal and several witnesses out of the courtroom, and thus the public eye, has only resulted in making the judges more curious. Maybe it's because the prosecutor knows that the whaling industry really has something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The government was hoping to bury this scandal by putting the messengers on trial," said Jun Hoshikawa, Greenpeace Japan Executive Director. "However, as more evidence of embezzlement comes to light, at the end of the day it will be whaling that is on trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If the Japanese government is going to arrest people for the crime of opposing whaling, they are going to need a lot of handcuffs.  Are you a suspect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us defend the Tokyo Two, and oppose whaling.  Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations. We rely on you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace – Yes Men spoof newspaper declares climate deal </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iht-se/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	A new exhibit in Aomori, Japan, gives a glimpse of Greenpeace history through one of our iconic communication tools: the t-shirt.
&lt;div&gt;

            Mai Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan and Fanny Lee of Greenpeace China at exhibition of Greenpeace t-shirts in Aomori, Japan, where two Greenpeace activists are on trial.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our campaigns have spawned many, many tees -- from the funny to the shrill, the plain and functional to the artistic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as action tools, as when activists aboard the Greenpeace ship Sirius were being escorted out of the Soviet Union, and in front of whirring cameras revealed the message "Stop Nuclear Testing" in Russian on the t-shirts  beneath their sweatshirts.  Or when activists in the high-security zone around a Star Wars missile test wore "Don't Shoot" tees -- messaging both the missile masters and the gun-toting guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as barter items with border guards, coveted and swapped among ships' crew, and sought after by collectors looking to create a complete timeline of the organisation in organic cotton. When our Japanese office put out the call to Greenpeacers around the world to empty their closets, they got nearly 200 examples of the art of the body billboard from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organiser Mai Suzuki, activist and Greenpeace t-shirt collector, hopes to tell the public about environmental risks and Greenpeace's efforts to tackle them in a simple and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many of us wear T-shirts every day. When you wear a Greenpeace T-Shirt, everyone can look at you on the street. It is a potent and direct way of communicating information," said Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157619186149933&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition also highlights the global support behind the Aomori communications centre, which was set up earlier this year to bring Greenpeace messages directly to people of the port city. Aomori is where Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are currently on trial for intercepting a box of embezzled whale meat, with the aim of exposing a long-standing culture of embezzlement within the government-sponsored whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They succeeded in exposing the scandal, but are now on trial themselves for "theft", despite having given the whale meat to the public prosecutor as evidence for an investigation into the embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition showcases a new t-shirt from Greenpeace UK, which was recently worn by activists during activities supporting Junichi and Tory, known as the "Tokyo Two", in London.  (Nudge, nudge -- you can &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;buy a version of that t-shirt at our online shop&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki hopes that the T-Shirts will show the Japanese public the passion Greenpeace has for its campaigns, and that it inspires them to take action themselves to right environmental wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is my wish that the public come and take a look at the T-Shirts, and realise that they have the power to change the world," said Suzuki.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;When you buy a Greenpeace t-shirt, the proceeds help keep us going. When you wear a Greenpeace t-shirt, you help spread the word about our campaigns. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;T-shirts alone can't keep our ships at sea and our activists free.  Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon destruction not such a good look </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/slaughteringtheamazon-160609/</url><text>
	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate challenge even greater after UN meeting in Bonn</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonntwo150609/</url><text>
	As another round of Bonn climate talks limps to a close, and the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December this year draws closer and closer, it’s a good opportunity to take a look at the progress that’s been made so far…
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Negotiators at the UN climate talks in Bonn failed to answer the call for emergency action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, almost everything is now on the table. On the minus side, almost everything now on the table is still on the table, and doesn't look likely to be going anywhere fast. In fact, one draft document that was 50 pages long at the start of the Bonn meeting is now closer to 300 pages long. Given that one of the purposes of this meeting was to narrow options down, it's safe to assume that 'progress', therefore, has not been significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money from the industrialised world to help developing countries to switch to clean energy, keep tropical rainforests intact and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts is still missing from the table. But the biggest space of all is where the robust, effective emissions cuts for industrialised countries should be. The science demands that, as a group, these countries need to cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of irreversible climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaders need apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate change issue has to be passed right to the top of the political 'food chain'. Heads of governments must take responsibility for protecting the climate and, in so doing, protecting the planet and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. There's probably not a single ministry or government department that remains untouched by this issue; energy, environment, foreign affairs, treasury - the list goes on. And every single one of them will have its own perspectives and priorities. In every capital city around the world, the person who has the 'big picture' - the person who sits at the desk where the buck ultimately stops - needs to stand up, step up and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next chance for action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, the heads of the world's richest countries will get together in Italy for the G8 Summit. This will be an historical opportunity for these leaders to break the deadlock and send a strong signal of intent by agreeing deep cuts in emissions and putting money on the table for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December around 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/5-of-the-kingsnorth-6-who-in.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish Prime Minister takes step towards EU leadership at UN Climate Summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/TuskCopenhagen04062009/</url><text>
	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to campaign for a green and peaceful future. You will make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Copenhagen a cop-out</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/copenhagen-wrap-up-191209/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;A shameful failure to save us from the effects of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Two years have passed since world leaders promised all of us a deal to stop climate change. After two weeks of UN negotiations, politicians breezed in, had dinner with the Queen, a three hour lunch, took some photos and then delivered what could only be described as the 24 hour Head of State tourist brochure of Copenhagen instead of a climate treaty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/the-little-mermaid-laments-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/the-little-mermaid-laments-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Think or Swim!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't believe the hype, there is nothing fair, ambitious or legally binding about this deal. The job of world leaders is not done. Today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/PageFiles/24942/cop15-assessment.pdf"&gt;Click here for a detailed assessment of the Copenhagen Accord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene tonight, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good, to avert catastrophic climate change. What we needed was a legally binding agreement that was fair to developing countries and ambitious when it came to emissions cuts and ending deforestation. In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through. We've seen a year of crises, but today it is clear that the biggest one facing humanity is a leadership crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's to blame?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year, a number of developing countries showed a willingness to accept their share of the burden to avert climate chaos. But in the end, the blame for failure mostly lies with the rich industrialised world, countries which have the largest historic responsibility for causing the problem. In particular, the US failed to take any real leadership and dragged the talks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are saying that we have only a few years left to stop the rise in emissions before making the kind of rapid reductions that would give us the best chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. We cannot change that science, so instead we will have to change the politics - and we may well have to change the politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen million people demanded that world leaders take responsibility and make good on their promise to deliver a real deal to save the climate. World leaders clearly heard us - echoing our messages in many of their own speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not over, people everywhere demanded a real deal before the Summit began and they are still demanding it. We can still save hundreds of millions of people from the devastation of a warming world, but it has just become a whole lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Executive Director and chair of the tcktcktck coalition, Kumi Naidoo said "Civil society, the bulk of which was locked out of the final days of this Climate Summit, now needs to redouble its efforts. Each and every one of us must hold our leaders to account. We must take the struggle to avert climate catastrophe into every level of politics, local, regional, national and international. We also need to take it into the board room and onto the high streets. We can either work for a fundamental change in our society or we can suffer the consequences of one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/me2"&gt;Together with other environmental and social justice groups, we are building the largest movement of civil society the world has ever witnessed. Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climatepolicy"&gt;Other briefings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join the global call for a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our urgent message to save the climate is resounding around the world now - thanks to individuals like you who support us. Please give what you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck. 
&lt;div&gt;

            Parody of the logo of French nuclear fuel company, Areva, manufacturer of the steam generators aboard the Happy Ranger.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Demand our leaders lead by signing a fair, ambitious, legally binding deal to stop climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest destruction is costing the global economy US $2 to $5 trillion per year — more than Wall Street has lost since the start of the current financial crisis. After stalling for years, the European Commission has finally come out with a proposal for illegal logging legislation and recommendations to tackle deforestation. Unfortunately, the law doesn’t do enough to address deforestation and illegal logging or what it is really costing us.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If the last ancient forests and all the life that’s in them don’t get a little love from the Environmental Ministers they will soon be wiped out. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, more than 125,000 of you wrote to
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, asking him to
show a little &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org//barossoloveletter" title="Forest Love"&gt;Forest Love&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the EU's
massive contribution to deforestation and illegal logging. Your
message got to the EU Commission, their response just doesn't go
far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU forest footprint not getting any smaller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed law won't keep illegal timber out of the EU, or
help you figure out if the flat-pack wardrobe you bought last
Saturday is the result of forest crime. There's no plan to make
sure that businesses prove their wood is legal or to make sure that
forest criminals bringing in illegal timber pay for their crimes.
And while the commission recognises the damage being caused by the
demand for agricultural commodities (such as soy beans, cattle and
palm oil) as a major contributor to deforestation, it doesn't
suggest a plan to eliminate the problem.  It commits only to more
studies and exploring policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of the world's rainforests to make way for
things like more palm oil plantations is driving climate change and
pushing species such as the orang-utan, to the brink of extinction.
Every time the rainforest is trashed, huge amounts of greenhouse
gases are released into the atmosphere. The destruction of our
rainforests accounts for a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions -
that's more than all the planes, trains and cars in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not all bad news, there are parts of the
recommendations that get forest protection right. We are happy to
see a recommendation for the creation of a fund for forest
protection under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The plan itself only provides a fraction of the money
needed for the fund to succeed, so now the Commission needs to
figure out how to make sure the fund can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission also rightly opposes forest offset credits for
the next decade. If forest credits were approved, they could allow
the energy sector to buy its way out of necessary reforms and
emission cuts. The EU Commission is taking a step in the right
direction by rejecting forest credits in the carbon markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European environment ministers are expected to discuss
deforestation at their Council on 4 December and the first
ministerial debate on the timber legislative proposal is expected
to take place at the agriculture Council on 17-19 December.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the last ancient forests and all the life that's in them
don't get a little love from the Environmental Ministers they will
soon be wiped out. If the EU is serious about protecting forests
and keeping temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, then
Parliament and Council need to step it up on the Commission
proposals.  We need a strong timber law and new economic incentives
and financial resources to put an end to deforestation and illegal
logging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Philips back in the red again</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philips-back-in-the-red161008/</url><text>
	Philips Electronics has long been in the red with a big fat zero on tackling e-waste in our Guide to Greener Electronics. Meanwhile, in Moscow’s Red Square, it is celebrating 110 years in Russia with its annual 'Sense and Simplicity' event. We did a spot of corporate gatecrashing to remind Philips that, after all these years, doing the right thing is still simple: take back and recycle. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Philips stands out as the company with the worst position on e-waste and recycling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips stands out as thebiggest obstacle to tackling the
growing problem of old electronics (e-waste)being dumped in
developing countries. Not that you'll find any reference tosuch
details in Philips' marketing material. That's why we paid a visit
tohighlight the real consequences of Philips' position. In fact, we
discoveredthat never mind simply not mentioning the real truth,
Philips' public materialwas overflowing with elaborate wording
gushing over how responsible, healthyand sustainable Philips
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Circle of irresponsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a copyof Philips' greenwashed press packet in a trash
bin. It claims Philips' eventis all about a healthy lifestyle and
maintaining a sustainableenvironment. It talks about
responsibleconsumption and a shopping experience it calls the
"Circle of Life." Philipsclaims the concepts and products presented
at the event are about itscommitment to "health and well-being of
people across the globe" and to"collective well-being, and helping
to create a sustainable global society toprotect our environment
for future generations."&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If this is the case, then why does
Philipsfail to take back and recycling it products globally in
contrast to manycompetitors like Dell and Nokia? Why does it refuse
to accept the real costs oftheir own e-waste? Instead, Philips
promotes and actively lobbies forgovernments and public to
subsidise recycling its e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unhealthy People, Unhealthy Living, Unhealthy Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips should takeresponsibility for its own products. If it is
really interested in a"sustainable global society", it should make
sure all of its products are collectedand not leave the burden of
cleaning up toxic e-waste on unprotected workers.E-waste can end up
in countries without recycling facilities and the recyclingworkers
treating the waste - often children - are exposed to a cocktail
oftoxic chemicals and poisons when the products are broken
apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unprotected workers in thee-waste dumps of China, India,
Pakistan and Ghana who end up dismantlingPhilips products are a
world away from Philips' 'Sense and Sensibility'marketing, but that
doesn't change the fact that Philips is the company whoseposition
is blocking real solutions to the problem. Watch the snap shot
ofpersonal stories of e-waste workers in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words healthy and sustainable certainly don't spring to mind
do they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other electronics producers, including Sony, Dell and
Lenovo,accept responsibility for their own products, supporting
'Individual ProducerResponsibility', and setting up free voluntary
take-back systems for theirproducts. Philips is lobbying against
the implementation of individual producerresponsibility, under
existing legislation and its adoption in futurelegislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare calling on Philips to accept responsibility for its own
e-waste and to takeback and recycle its products in every country
where they are sold. It shouldpay for the recycling of its own
products.When producers pay the real recycling costs, they have an
incentive tostop using toxic materials in the design of their
products and make them moredurable and recyclable in order to lower
the recycling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Tell Philips to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

	Greenpeace today embarked on the Indonesian leg of its "Forests for Climate" ship tour, to shine the spotlight on the rampant destruction of the Paradise Forests - the last remaining ancient forests of Southeast Asia.

            A group of Papuanese traditional dancers greets the Esperanza during a welcoming ceremony at Jayapura port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; arrived in Jayapura, in the Indonesian
province of Papua, to an energetic welcome from a troupe of
traditional dancers, and local dignitaries - including the mayor of
Jayapura - gave their support to our campaign."Forests for Climate"
is not only the slogan for our Paradise Forests tour - it's also
the name of a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forests_for_climate_brochure/" target="_blank"&gt;landmark proposal&lt;/a&gt; Greenpeace has developed,
for an international funding mechanism toprotect tropical
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just completed a six-week tour of neighbouring Papua New
Guinea, the &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; will tour Indonesia starting with the
provinces of Papua and West Papua, which represent the last
frontier of intact ancient forests in the country. Over the next
six weeks, the ship will be touring the archipelago to document the
threats facing the forests of Papua and Sumatra as well as the
companies and politicians responsible. Also, we will be
highlighting the short and long-term solutions to the crisis so
these forests can be permanently protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one half of the remote and mountainous New Guinea island,
Papua contains the largest area of remaining forest in Indonesia -
with those of Sumatra and Kalimantan on the island of Borneo
largely gone or degraded, this really is the last frontier. The
region is home to hundreds of distinct tribes and clans with a
corresponding range of cultural diversity, and for biodiversity is
second to none, with animals and plants new to science being
recorded on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That alone makes the forests worth protecting, but we now
realise they're also vitally important when it comes to climate
change. Not only do the trees and soil act as huge carbon stores,
cutting them down also releases that carbon in the form of
greenhouse gases. Indonesia is the third largest emitter on the
planet, largely due to deforestation and its forests are
disappearing faster than anywhere in the world, so to prevent
climate change we have to save the forests, including those in
Papua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to do this is to place a moratorium on all deforestation
across Indonesia, which will provide the breathing space necessary
to work on plans to safeguard the future of these forests. The
Indonesian government is the one to lay down a moratorium, but it
also needs the palm oil industry to provide ministers the space to
do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/" target="_blank"&gt;the victory with our Dove campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier
this year, we have been working with companies such as Unilever to
build a coalition in favour of an immediate moratorium on forest
conversion for palm oil and insisting their palm oil suppliers do
not clear further forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of climate change are already being felt around the
world and we don't have long to prevent the worst predictions
becoming inevitable. We still have time if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

	We've been watching the horizon for this one for a very long time, but our colleagues up in the crow's nest report that a new blip on the horizon could mean an end to Japanese whaling in Antarctica.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "I can see an end to whaling from here!"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major review of Japanese government spending could spell the end to whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioned to cut wasteful programmes by Japan's new government, a review committee has proposed massive cuts in subsidies to a body which funds the so-called whaling research programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without government subsidies, the whaling programme would be doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spending Review Committee recommended that the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Fund (OFCF), which gives loans to the Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR) to run the discredited science programme, have all of its funding revoked, except monies needed for loans in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFCF claims it needs 70.4 billion yen (around US$780 million) for various programmes, including whaling, in 2010. The Review Committee and Cabinet Office will determine by early next year if the proposed operations for 2010 are actually "necessary" or should also be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waste of money? Well, yes...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact is, if the Review Committee wanted to know if whaling was a waste of taxpayers' money or not, they could have asked us. Our colleagues at Greenpeace Japan have been relentlessly attacking the whaling programme domestically for exactly that reason for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, two activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, sparked a domestic debate in Japan in June 2008 when they revealed widespread corruption in the government-supported programme. They set off a backlash from powerful interests, and found themselves arrested for "stealing" whale meat which they had presented to police as evidence of embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt; 
&lt;object width="430" height="268" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/SGCmZkJlJUM&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SGCmZkJlJUM&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru were arrested with the TV cameras rolling, and our Greenpeace offices were raided by police who seized supporter lists, documents, and computer disks in an attempt to intimidate our staff and supporters and deter our efforts.  Junichi and Toru still await trial and face up to ten years in prison for the "crime" of exposing a misuse of public money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the charges, they have not been quiet. Both activists have spoken out against the cost of the whaling programme and the fact that only a handful of fat-cat bureaucrats really profit from the programme. Last year alone it cost 8 billion yen, or nearly US$90  million, to run the annual Southern Ocean whale hunt. Of that, 1.2 billion yen, or more than US$10 million, came from government subsidies. The rest is in theory covered by the sales of whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling is bad business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Cetacean Research, which runs the whaling programme, has failed to repay government loans for several years now, as demand for whale meat has plummeted and the cost of whaling increased. Practises which would have lead to bankruptcy for any commercial firm have been the target of outspoken criticism not only from Greenpeace Japan, but from the business press and even the former spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Tomohiko Taniguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taniguchi lamented the financial propping up of a programme that caused endless headaches for Tokyo abroad and generated revenues worth "less than one-tenth the value of the country's annual market for toothbrushes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the change in government at the recent election, a new focus on reducing  spending and cutting wasteful programmes has meant a more sympathetic ear for whaling critics like Junichi and Toru. The Prime Minster recently shocked conservative politicians who equate whaling and patriotism by admitting that he disliked whale meat -- something that would have been an unthinkable admission for his predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24955/humpback-whale-and-calf-off-th.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="259"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thirty+ years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been fighting Japanese whaling for more than three decades, from the waters of the Southern Ocean to the online world to the courts of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first brought whaling to the world's attention in 1975 when activists put their own lives on the line by navigating small inflatable boats in front of the harpoons.   We have opposed whaling operations in countries including Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Iceland, Spain, Norway and Russia and exposed and shut down pirate whaling operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our tactics have widened to include consumer pressure -- which was crucial in getting western corporations such as Gortons Seafood to distance themselves from whaling,  financially isolating the whalers -- and domestic efforts in Japan aimed at communicating the cost of whaling to the 71 percent of the Japanese public that do not support it.  In 2008, we suspended our voyages to the Southern Oceans in favour of concentrating efforts on domestic pressure in Japan, including "Operation Silver Bullet" -- our ongoing investigation into whale meat embezzlement and scandals in the whaling industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it seems that strategy is paying off.  All of us who have worked together on this issue for decades are holding our breath -- that an end to Japanese whaling could well be on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/contact-the-prosecutor/"&gt;Ask the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's office to reopen the investigation into whale meat embezzlement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	Our oceans are being plundered by pirates. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing – also known as "pirate fishing" - has become a global scourge. From international waters around the world, to the islands of the South Pacific and the coastal communities of West Africa, fisheries are in crisis.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Pirate fishing can be stopped. Governments can outlaw flags of convenience and refuse entry to fishing and supply vessels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirates are pulling in billions of dollars of fish that
rightfully belongs to coastal communities or falls beyond any one
country's waters. Pirate fishing affects communities that cannot
afford to be robbed of their livelihoods, leaves the marine
environment bruised and battered, and undermines food security and
attempts at sustainable management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roll call&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official lists of pirate vessels are limited in the information
they contain and don't include the names of the big companies
behind these pirate fishing vessels. It's time for the truth: for
fish purchasers, retailers, and the public to see who's behind
pirate fishing, and for ship owners to start taking responsibility
in their role. Companies often have illegal and legal vessels
fishing side by side. It is time they pay the real price for piracy
and have all their operations held accountable when caught
pirate-fishing.  We've launched an online database of fishing
vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, and the companies who own them.   &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/" title="Pirate Blacklist"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our IUU blacklist is the first independent record of fishing
vessels, support vessels and companies involved in pirate fishing. 
It includes independent observations from the legal fishing
industry, government authorities, and first-hand evidence from
Greenpeace and other NGOs who have recorded the activities of these
vessels and companies at sea and in ports around the world.  The
new database supplements the existing IUU database that was
launched in 2007, which contained only those pirate fishing vessels
officially blacklisted by regional fisheries management
organisations and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging all retailers and seafood traders to ensure
they do not purchase pirate-caught fish and, as a first step,
ensure that they do not trade with companies listed as operators of
pirate vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a long-awaited display of responsibility, the European Parliament’s Environment committee has voted through a strong package to reduce emissions from cars. As the committee went into session, it seemed certain that a compromise package riddled with loopholes would be the one to pass. However, the MEPs voted to stick with meaningful legislation, turning their backs on nine months of lobbying by the car industry.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists from Greenpeace Spain climbed the Osborne Bull, an internationally known symbol of Spanish roads, to "protect" him from increasing CO2 emissions from cars.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, average fleet emissions from new cars, which
are currently around 158 grams &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be reduced to 130 grams/km by 2012&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Must fall further to 95 grams by 2020&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For every gram over the average a manufacturer will face fines
of 95 euro per car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal still has to pass the full EU Parliament and the
Council of Ministers. But this is now increasingly likely to
happen, and we'll be defending this package every inch of the
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as a huge blow to the car industry lobby, which
has shamelessly defended its right to drive climate change by
putting profits ahead of the climate. The lobby, led by Volkswagen,
Mercedes and BMW will now have to embrace a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Activists Declare Nuclear Age Dead End</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activist-declare-nuclear-age-d/</url><text>
	Activists turned the front of the Turkish Ministry of Energy into a mortuary to highlight the deadly risks involved with establishing a nuclear industry in Turkey. On the eve of a nuclear tender from the Turkish government, 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group were arrested after they took to the street to protest the dangerous decision. 
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists were arrested after protesting the possible development of two new nuclear plants in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists unfurled a banner demanding a "STOP" to nuclear energy
and laid themselves on the line with a "die in" on the street in
front of the ministry. The protest ended when the 37 activists were
arrested, but they were later released without charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is currently nuclear-free and is considering nuclear
energy as a quick and cheap fix to its energy needs.  But nuclear
energy is anything but quick or cheap. In addition to being
extremely dangerous and dirty, nuclear energy will be a huge
financial burden on the people of Turkey. Greenpeace is urging the
government to cancel the nuclear tender and invest in clean, safe
renewable alternatives and greater energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not quick but very dirty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the hundreds of billions of US dollars that have been
given to the global nuclear industry in the past fifty years, we
still haven't seen a solution to the issues raised by waste and
security problems. A nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes
of nuclear waste annually. This means an additional 12,000 - 14,000
tonnes of waste are added to the already existing stockpiles of
nuclear waste every year. After recent radiation leaks in Spain and
incidents at plants in France, Sweden and Japan, you can't help but
wonder just how close we are to another Chernobyl. France leads as
an example of how dangerous nuclear energy can be, with
approximately 900 incidents a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear: an economic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with not being able to deal with all the risks, nuclear
power is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs and
construction time, companies do not want to invest. Neither the
World Bank nor the Asian Development Bank will give credits to the
nuclear projects on the grounds that they are too risky
financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means tax payers need to take the burden. The two nuclear
projects currently under construction in Turkey are about three
times over budget, and when the plants complete their lifetime,
decommissioning and cleaning will present yet another bill for the
taxpayer. It is unacceptable that the Turkish government wants to
spend its citizens hard-earned billions of liras on dirty,
dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for an Energy [R]evolution. Let's not fall
back on power from the past. We've come up with a plan to move from
a world powered by nuclear and fossil fuels to one running on
renewable energy. Download the blueprint for an Energy

	Four climbers from our ship the Rainbow Warrior were arrested yesterday, in Turkey,  after they occupied a giant coal loading platform to prevent a delivery of coal to the giant Sugozo coal-fired power station, one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world. After 11 hours blocking coal coming off the “Global Winner” (“Global Warmer” more like), a South African cargo ship, they were forced down by police using high-pressure water hoses. The four climbers and their support team have now been released and are facing the prospect of heavy fines for their actions.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists board one of the world's largest coal platforms at Botas Oil Terminal, stopping barges from importing coal to the Sugozu (Isken) coal fired power plant.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugozu coal power plant emits some 10 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide (CO2) a year (three times as much as Iceland), which
makes it the fourth largest single emitter of greenhouse gases in
the world, in terms of power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action was designed to send a message to the Turkish state
authority EMRA (Energy Market Regulatory Authority) - which is
responsible for licensing coal power plants. Launching Greenpeace
Turkey's  "Quit Coal" campaign, the action is just the beginning of
our work to stop the construction of 40 new coal fired power plants
currently planned in Turkey. Insanely, almost all of them will rely
on imported coal in a country where wind and solar alone could
easily exceed current electricity demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is already an international disgrace when it comes to
increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and has failed to even ratify
the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilal Atici, our Greenpeace Mediterranean Coal Campaigner says
"The Isken action is just the beginning - we will not stop until
our government wakes up and quits coal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Mediterranean Executive Director has requested a
meeting with EMRA this week to press our case. He will be outside
their head offices in Ankara ensuring that they listen to our very
simple demand "No new coal in Turkey - Embrace an energy
revolution." The ship is now en-route to Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is the second country on Greenpeace's European "Quit
Coal" ship tour - we are taking the message directly to governments
in the run-up to crucial UN climate negotiations in Poznan, Poland
this December. Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for post
2012 need to be set and the final agreement on these will be made
in Copenhagen in 2009. The period leading up to this is really
"make of break" for the climate. The message is pretty clear - in
order to have any meaningful deal to save the climate, the world
has to quit coal - the worst polluter of all fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

	The Israeli police, supported by the navy, arrested the captain of the Rainbow Warrior - together with 14 Greenpeace activists, the photographer and the videographer - for passing on the message to “Quit Coal”. Activists had been painting the message, in English and Hebrew, on a ship importing coal to the Ashkelon power plant in Israel. Police boarded the Rainbow Warrior before we had even started the painting.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Israeli Marine forces boarded the Rainbow Warrior at the military restricted area near the Ashkelon coal plant before arresting 14 activists together with the captain who were simply asking Israel to "Quit Coal" and "Save the Climate".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Captain, Daniel Rizotti, was arrested by Israeli police. The
officers, arriving on a military ship and carrying machine guns,
came on board and demanded that he sail back to Ashdod, the port we
had left that morning. So, still waiting for the release of our
activists, we sailed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest marked the launch of our "&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
Quit Coal: Save the Climate&lt;/a&gt;" tour through the Mediterranean and
Europe. Israel is only the beginning of our journey; we're visiting
11 countries en route to Poland, where crucial UN climate
negotiations continue this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why "Quit Coal"?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, when it comes to climate change, coal is by far the
worst offender.  Yet governments seem to be missing the message,
approving plans for hundreds of new coal-fired plants. If they
don't wake up to the urgent need to stop this, then by 2030 carbon
emissions coming from coal will have increased by some 60 percent.
We're here to sound the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our action in Israel was a wake-up call to the government to
abandon its plans for a new coal plant in Ashkelon. Despite
thousands of Israelis voicing their opposition to this unnecessary
and dirty plant, the government has approved plans anyway. But it's
not too late! &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-israel/news/coal_action_092008"&gt;Greenpeace
is urging all Israelis - whether at home or abroad - to lodge a
complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunny Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is very, very sunny. So it's pretty crazy that Israel is
not embracing this solar potential and instead continues to rely on
imported coal (not to mention the CO2 emissions of shipping the
coal to Israel from Colombia, Indonesia and Australia). Israel is
getting some things right - it has built the world's first solar
thermal plant, and it's selling that technology worldwide.
Something to celebrate indeed. But more is needed for Israel to be
guaranteed a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world must quit its addiction to coal; luckily we have the
cure. Greenpeace's &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/energyrevolution-250107/"&gt;
Energy [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; scenario shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 50%, and deliver half the world's energy needs by
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, we now have our captain, activists, media team,
inflatables and cameras  back on board. We've been deported from
Israel, but now we're heading for Turkey - and the next stage of
our &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/"&gt;
"Quit Coal" tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/petition-quit-coal-israel/"&gt;Tell Israel to Quit Coal! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you we can't afford to run our ships and support our activists.

	The fishing industry seems determined to catch every last fish in the North Sea.  The governments of the region and the EU have done little to stop them, but  they may soon hit a few snags: a team from Greenpeace Germany and Greenpeace Netherlands has sailed into the German North Sea and begun placing 150 granite rocks on the seabed.  They are hoping that the rocks, each weighing 2-3 tonnes and measuring one square cubic metre, will prevent fishing boats from bottom trawling on the Sylt Outer Reef.  This highly destructive fishing method involves a net being dragged across the seabed indiscriminately catching everything in its path.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Bottom-trawling boats drag fishing gear weighing several tonnes across the sea bed, destroying fragile underwater ecosystems and decimating fish stocks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling not only decimates stocks of popular fish, such
as sole and plaice, but it also results in a large amount of
bycatch - which is thrown back into the sea either dead or
dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Netherlands and Greenpeace Germany are taking direct
action to protect the fragile rocky reef and sandbank habitats and
the many species that are dependent on them. The German Government
and fishing industry are unwilling to address the ongoing
destruction of vulnerable marine habitats and the imminent collapse
of North Sea fish stocks.  We hope that fishermen will now steer
clear of the Sylt Outer Reef and respect it as a marine
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25132/150-granite-rocks-are-being-pl.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, fish stocks are in free fall with around 90 percent of
predatory species, like tuna, having been wiped out since the
1950s. If we carry on with business as usual, very soon there will
be no fish left and no future for the industry. Only in June,
scientists warned that cod stocks in the North Sea are so depleted
that fishing must be halted altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, these warnings have been ignored. Rather than
establishing a marine reserve to allow the North Sea to recover,
European Ministers continue to bury their heads in the sand and
vote to increase catch quotas year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in areas recognised for their high ecological importance,
such as the Sylt Outer Reef, the destruction continues. Not only is
fishing allowed, but also industry extracts vast quantities of sand
and gravel, with devastating consequences for marine habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper these types of activity shouldn't be happening. The
Sylt Outer Reef is protected under European law - designated as a
'Special Area of Conservation' under the EU Habitats Directive. But
in reality this protection is worth little more than the paper it
is written on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are demanding that the German government push the European
Commission to put in place new measures to enforce a ban on fishing
in the area by the beginning of next year at the latest. We also
want the Dutch, Danish and UK governments to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want the German government to immediately put a stop to
the industrial extraction of sand and gravel in the area by
ensuring no new licences are issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, governments need to establish a global network of
fully protected marine reserves covering 40 percent of the world's
oceans, including the North Sea.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;In order to preserve our independence we don't accept money from governments or corporations.

	It's a victory for the Whitsunday Islands and the Great Barrier Reef, with a 20-year moratorium on all new shale oil projects in the region. Led by the Save Our Foreshore group, the success shows just how powerful local, grassroots campaigns can be.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef off the Whitsunday Islands. The proposed shale oil mine would have posed a range of threats to the region.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban has been welcomed by just about everyone but the
QueenlandResource Council, whose proposal was set to mine millions
of tonnes ofshale rock each year on a site just 10 km from the
gateway to the GreatBarrier Reef. The shale oil mine threatened to
drain precious watersupplies, and to risk toxic leaching and air
pollution from waste rock.Shale oil production is extremely
greenhouse gas intensive - emissionsfrom this project, combined
with the company's other plannedoperations, would have raised
Australia's current total emissions by30 percent within 20
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great win but it is madness that such a project could
haveeven been considered. We are facing catastrophic climate change
- wemust urgently cut emissions, not increase them. We don't need
toendanger the Great Barrier Reef or anywhere else by mining
fossilfuels. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/climate-change/solutions/clean-energy"&gt;
There are better energy sources&lt;/a&gt; that are ready to go right now.
If Queensland Premier Anna Bligh canblock this proposal for climate
reasons, we look forward to herblocking other major fossil fuel
projects in the state, includingexport coal expansions, for the
same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined &lt;a href="http://www.saveourforeshore.com/"&gt;Save Our Foreshore&lt;/a&gt; in

	Patience for world leaders talking about tackling climate change is wearing thin. Just as US President Barack Obama addressed a crowd of thousands in Prague on Sunday, Greenpeace activists unveiled a banner urging him to "lead the change on climate", a challenge Obama accepted in his speech. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/six-greenpeace-activists-unfur.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six Greenpeace activists unfurled a huge banner with a message addressed to leaders of the EU-US Summit in Prague saying: "Bail out the climate!".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile far, far away from the EU-US Summit, an ice-bridge holding the Wilkins Ice Shelf (the size of Jamaica) to Antarctica collapsed due to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delivering an urgent message to world leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also unfurled a huge banner reading "Bail Out the Climate" from Prague's Nustle bridge, in full view of venue hosting the EU and US summit, which President Obama is also attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama said that the US is ready to lead on climate change. Now we need to see the European Union commit to working with him on that. This year's major UN climate change summit in Copenhagen is now only eight months away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all has been said and done &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/no-climate-bail-out-from-europ/"&gt; at recent summits&lt;/a&gt; of world leaders discussing climate action, much more has been said than really done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A transatlantic alliance we can be proud of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the US claiming to be committed to action on climate change there is an opportunity for the transatlantic alliance to take real action. Runaway climate change could make poverty permanent in the developing world, and strangle growth in the developed world, but the right decisions could head off the looming crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable impacts of climate change, developing countries need at least EUR 110 billion a year by 2020 from rich countries. This money should be raised through an international scheme that asks rich nations to pay for their carbon footprint, thus providing the certainty developing countries need to leverage private funds for green investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;40 percent GHG emission reductions by 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides financing green measures in developing countries, both the US and the EU will need to upgrade their reduction targets in the light of recent science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid runaway climate change, developed countries as a group need to commit to an aggregate target of at least 40 percent emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2020. (Read Greenpeace demands for Copenhagen: &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands/"&gt; Long version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt; Short version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Leaders: Mark your diaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders have a chance to deliver both the financing and emission cuts through the UN climate process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we're calling on heads of state to tae personal responsibility for thenegotiations and sign up to attend the final climate summit in Copenhagen, at the end of the year: to ensure a good deal for the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meanwhile Antarctica melts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shattering of the bridge connecting the Wilkins Ice Shelf to Antartica comes in stark contrast to the glacial pace of the international climate negotiations taking place in Bonn where governments are trying to avoid acting responsibly, and bickering about who's at fault (hint: somebody else is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, since ice-shelves float, their collapse will not in itself contribute to sea level rise. Nonetheless, any resultant increase in the "flow" of inland glaciers due to the loss of the shelves, together with increased melt water runoff will add to sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it in context, it's probable that the current reduction in ice-shelves in the region has no precedent in the last 10,000 years, and it is certain that this minimum has not been reached at any time in the last millennium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate negotiators back out again in Bonn </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-negotiators-back-out-090409/</url><text>
	Another round of climate talks is over, this time in Bonn, Germany. Once again negotiators are leaving without a plan or having left any money on the table to tackle climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/hemnagar.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Heads of state need to commit to being present at negotiations to solve the climate crisis before it is too late.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats and negotiators have been wasting precious time for two weeks while the rest the world watches as ice caps melt, ice-sheets break off in Antarctica and Australia suffers from flash floods. What are they waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes we can&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there was a ray of hope on the horizon. The presence of the Obama administration at the climate negotiations and the fact that the US is once again engaged in the discussions seems to have lifted the mood. However, there has been little or no real progress made on the key issues and decisions we need on climate change. A change in mood just isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need our heads of state, world leaders, to take responsibility. We need all of the Presidents, Chancellors and Prime Ministers of the world to take personal responsibility and commit to making climate change important enough to show up to these meetings themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop letting weeks of negotiations go by without any progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need our leaders to take responsibility for this process, give their negotiators clear and strong direction over the course of this year, and show up to the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December, and make sure that we all get the climate deal that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A little less conversation, a little more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need real leadership and some hard numbers. The US has to come back with solid proposals in June, at the next round of negotiations, and the rest of the industrialised world has to knuckle down and close the gap between what they have agreed to and what the science says is necessary to to avert runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need targets for reducing greenhouse gases and money on the table for poorer countries to pay for climate impacts they're already experiencing and to take action to control their own growing emissions. This has a price tag - developing countries need at least EUR 110 billion a year (USD $140 billion). This money should be raised through an international scheme that asks rich nations to pay for their carbon footprint, providing the certainty developing countries need to leverage private funds for green investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides financing green measures in developing countries, both the US and the EU will need to upgrade their reduction targets in the light of recent science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid runaway climate change, developed countries as a group need to commit to 40 percent emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Tunmore, one our climate experts, who was at the Bonn meeting warned: "We are on the brink of runaway climate change. World leaders need to realise that they can't change climate science so they must urgently intervene and change the politics. Greenpeace will be working on behalf of the billions of people who will suffer to make sure that happens."&lt;/p&gt;

	Twenty-four years after the attack by the French secret services against our ship the Rainbow Warrior - which cost the life of a Greenpeace photographer - the nuclear industry is once again at the heart a major spy scandal involving Greenpeace. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/more-nuclear-power-less-nucl.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/more-nuclear-power-less-nucl.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nuclear power makes some people really mad. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it is top staff at nuclear energy giant Electricité de France (EDF) that have been charged on suspicion of spying on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what spooked EDF? What worries them about our efforts to reveal the hidden face of the nuclear industry as being dangerous, expensive and unnecessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It all began... &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, ten activists set off in a tiny boat to prevent a nuclear blast planned by the United   States. This was Greenpeace's founding activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the world, we fight to expose the risks presented by nuclear energy and weapons, from radioactive waste transport to waste management to the risk of accidents.  We also highlight that &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/nuclear_fallacy/"&gt;nukes are no answer to climate change&lt;/a&gt;.  "Clean and safe" nuclear energy is a myth. People deserve and are entitled to a transparent and democratic debate on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story in France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, Greenpeace campaigns against EDF and French nuclear company Areva, particularly the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) a third generation reactor that is scheduled to be switched on in 2012 in Flamanville,  France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2009, following official confirmation that Nicolas Sarkozy would build a second EPR, we revealed evidence that waste from this type of reactor would be seven times more dangerous than the waste generated by its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in March of this year we made public the facts about the latest Mixed-Oxide (MOX) transport from France to Japan. The Areva shipment contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in the MOX - enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated Nagasaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controversy started three years earlier, in May 2006, when we provoked the fury of the French government by publishing online a classified document showing the vulnerability of the Flamanville reactor should an airplane hit it in an accident or 9/11-style attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By publishing this document, Greenpeace played its role as a whistleblower," said Pascal Husting, executive director of Greenpeace France. "As such, the work of our activists should be protected by the state rather than be monitored or attacked by private companies!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent and non-violent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the French Government infiltrated Greenpeace in 1985, their objective was to derail our campaign against nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Their plan not only failed, it utterly backfired. The public response around the world was outrage, and in the end we won our campaign.  Despite being turned into a national pariah, Greenpeace France not only survived, it came back stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is built on two fundamental values: independence (both political &amp;amp; financial), and non-violence. We are not supported by any political party, do not endorse candidates and exist because of the generosity of individuals who choose to donate to us. This structural independence is how we guarantee the freedom of speech and action of the organisation, in all places and under all circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-violence is a fundamental element of all our activities. Based on these fundamental values, we mobilize public opinion and force decision-makers to address problems that threaten the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France as in the rest of the world, there's not a government or a corporation which can keep Greenpeace from being Greenpeace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	There’s still a long way to go, but the draft energy and climate bill unveiled yesterday in the US Congress gives some idea of what American climate policy may look like in the coming years. The bill provides for strong long-term targets, efficiency legislation, a cap-and-trade system, and sets the goal that 25 per cent of US electricity must come from renewable energy by 2025.Time to break out the champagne? Not quite...
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            US Climate Policy may not be hell and high water any more. But how good is it?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed efficiency standards are good and, as the experience of Japan and California shows, they work. By directing the EPA to establish regulation for refrigeration chemicals, cars, aviation and shipping, the bill could bring to many sectors the effective environmental governance they have previously lacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum portfolio standards for electricity markets are another proven success that can now be taken up nationally. One of the most successful examples is the standard in Texas, a state now at the heart of the US wind industry. A long-term target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 83 per cent by 2050 is nothing to be sniffed at either, and brings the US in line with the long-term ambitions of many progressive nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating a range of effective policy tools the bill will give the US government the power it needs to take strong action on global warming. The question is, will it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the short term targets aren't so good. When climate negotiators talk about cuts they mean cuts relative to 1990, the year specified in the Kyoto Treaty. Congressman Henry Waxman is talking about cuts relative to 2005, when emissions were much higher. If you convert the bill's domestic emissions cuts of 20 per cent by 2020 into '1990' emissions you get a cut of around 7 or 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These limited cuts are made even weaker by the provision in the bill for two billion tons of offsets. At first read, what this means in practice is that the US fossil fuel industry could continue to pump out CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, unabated, for the next 20 years, and buy its way out of saving the climate by buying cheaper, lower-quality emissions reductions from elsewhere, instead of taking responsibility for reducing its own pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound like progress to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real emissions reductions better than offsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest science is clear. The world needs to cut emissions far more quickly. To stop global warming, the world must end emissions from deforestation and industry. The developed world as a whole needs to achieve cuts of at least 40 per cent relative to 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years of environmental neglect under George Bush mean that US emissions have skyrocketed, but even an achievable overall  US commitment of 25 per cent - with at least 12 per cent domestic cuts in fossil fuel use - would help put the developed world on the path to climate victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill offers up to 10 billion dollars to fund Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).  This is just a way to extend a business-as-usual approach where the polluter gets paid rather than punished - and paid, no less, with money taken from the American taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate champions in Congress are working to enact a climate change plan by the end of this year, ahead of the climate negotiations taking place in Copenhagen. To do that, the bill must first secure the support of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, then the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the Senate needs to adopt its own version of the bill and pass it. Then the two bills will need to be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves plenty of scope for the bill to be changed, and here are the big changes that need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the targets and ensure that at least 12 per cent of the emissions cuts come through reductions in domestic fossil fuel use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop the funding for CCS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auction pollution permits, ensuring polluters pay and that revenues are used for climate and public benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these improvements are made, President Obama can arrive in Copenhagen with a real opportunity to forge the global deal that ends global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

	We've got a message for the leaders of the richest nations in the world who are gathering in London for the G20 meeting to discuss the global economic crisis.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace action in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen activists unfurled this 50 meter (164 feet) x 30 meter (98 feet) banner from the bridge at the Guanabara bay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to send this message from the birthplace of two of the most important UN Conventions of modern times, addressing climate change and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge wave of hope created by the World Summit ECO-92 (better known as the Earth Summit) in Rio -- that all countries would work together to save life on Earth -- has vanished. After 17 years without serious action by the world's leaders to change the pattern of carbon-based development, the planet is close to reaching the point where runaway climate change cannot be averted unless we act now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wasted opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will the G20 tackle the economic and climate crises at the same time by greening their economies? Unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy G20 nations need to commit at least 1 percent of their GDP to green measures, and the remaining countries should do all they can to leapfrog dirty carbon-based development and shift to a renewable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G20 leaders represent three-quarters of global GDP, three-quarters of energy consumption and three-quarters of carbon emissions. So far, they appear not to have grasped that their continuing prosperity is not in conflict with preserving the environment, but dependant upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crisis? You call THIS a crisis?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we don't face a choice of green jobs or dirty jobs, but green jobs or ecological and social collapse. Until climate change is at the top of the G20 communiqué and at the centre of their thinking, they aren't just scientifically illiterate, but economically illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science shows climate change is accelerating. A full-blown climate crisis raises the prospect of mass migration, mass starvation and mass extinctions. It will make poverty permanent in the developing world and strangle growth in the developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions the G20 leaders take will affect the 172 countries not represented at this meeting, many of which are both the poorest and most vulnerable to the economic crisis and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likely cost of climate change impacts is up to 20 percent of global output; more than the Great Depression and both World Wars combined - in addition to the human deaths and species extinctions, according to former World Bank chief economist &lt;a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Stern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Save forests to help stop climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries must also take responsibility to fight global warming, and in particular those which host tropical rainforests. Brazil and Indonesia are the world's fourth and third largest greenhouse gas emitters due to forest destruction in their countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Brazilian Institute of Space Research, which monitors deforestation, close to 29 million hectares of the Amazon rainforest have been destroyed since the creation of the UN Climate convention in Rio 92. This has added some 8 gigatons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending Amazon deforestation is the major contribution Brazil can make to help the world to tackle climate change. Still, Brazil must take the leadership by supporting the establishment of a funding mechanism to stop forest clearance and associated emissions, acknowledging the value of the standing forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bonn, Germany, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/climate-meeting-bonn-290309/"&gt; 129 countries representatives are meeting&lt;/a&gt; to initiate a series of negotiations culminating with the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December, where a global deal to save the climate must be agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate meeting in Bonn: save the forests, but don't cheapen carbon</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonn-climate-meeting-forests300309/</url><text>
	If we're to have a hope of saving our planet from runaway climate change, we need to make it expensive for industry to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, and we need to make it profitable for countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to preserve their tropical rainforests.  Sounds angelically simple, but we need real leadership at the Bonn climate conference to get the devil out of the details. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/organgutans-are-an-endangered.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/7/organgutans-are-an-endangered.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Saving her shouldn't put money in the pocket of a polluter.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around twenty percent of the world's greenhouse gasses come from deforestation. You read that right: twenty percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives to preserve our forests, and in particular the tropical rainforests which are vast carbon consumers, are essential to any deal to stop runaway climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How NOT to save the world's rainforests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forest protection is relatively cheap, and there's a risk that incentives for forest protection can be used to dilute the value of all carbon credits, giving big polluters an easier ride when they have to buy carbon credits on the open market.  The cheaper a ton of carbon pollution is to purchase, the less likely it is that a corporation or government will seek real reduction solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, not a few corporate lobbyists and heel-dragging governments have figured this out, and would love to see forest credits included in the carbon markets in a way that would make carbon cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just released &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/REDD-implications"&gt; a report&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/the-economics-of-redd-summary/"&gt; summary here&lt;/a&gt;) that demonstrates that including forest protection measures in carbon markets could crash the price of carbon by up to 75 percent and derail global efforts to tackle global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also lead to developing countries losing out on billions of dollars a year for investment in clean energy technologies. If these countries don't get incentives for a switch to low-carbon technologies, through carbon markets and funds, emissions will continue to rise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean energy investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report shows that countries like China, India and Brazil could lose tens of billions of dollars for clean energy investments if forest protection measures are included in an unrestricted carbon market.  Such a move would cause a "lock in" effect where dirty technologies, like coal fired power plants, would continue to be built and operated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also slash the number and value of energy credits, so countries like China and India would get less money for sustainable development policies -- an estimated $10 billion per year for China alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap forest credits sound attractive but a closer examination shows they are a dangerous option that won't save the forests or stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many options for forest financing currently on the table, this one ranks as the worst.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_full/international/photosvideos/photos/aerial-view-in-the-rainforest.jpg?plk" alt="Beltra: forests burning" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, how do we stimulate renewables AND save the forests?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a solution -- it's a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/solutions/forests_for_climate"&gt; separate fund for forest preservation. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the carbon markets should focus on driving clean and renewable technologies in key industrial sectors; and developed countries should make an additional "tropical deforestation commitment" to help finance forest protection in developing countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be done best through a new forest fund  -- one which values both the climate and biodiversity benefits provided by forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests contain half of all life on Earth. Orangutans, elephants, tigers and jaguars are just some of the animals who make their homes in tropical forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 150 million indigenous people live in forests worldwide. It's these people that need to have their futures secured so they can remain guardians of the forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If countries commit to a Forests for Climate fund, we can achieve win-win-win benefits for climate, biodiversity, and local communities and forest peoples.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line benefit for protecting our forests should not go to the planet's biggest polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>HP, Lenovo and Dell still on the toxic stuff</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/hp-lenovo-and-dell-get-a-310309/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Top PC makers are slipping behind in Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We're giving HP, Lenovo and Dell a penalty point in our updated Guide to Greener Electronics, for breaking their promises to phase-out toxic chemicals in 2009. Of the world's five top PC makers, only Apple is truly kicking the habit. Meanwhile Philips has jumped from 15th to 4th place in the list of electronics companies who are cleaning up their act.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists demonstrate against e-waste outside the Hewlett Packard (HP) Beijing headquarters. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP, Lenovo and Dell had promised to eliminate vinyl plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from their products by the end of 2009. Now they've told us that they won't make it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase-out of toxic substances is an urgent priority to help tackle the growing tide of e-waste. Still, producers only go green when they feel public and consumer pressure to do so. That's why we campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell produces a desktop, a notebook and several models of monitors that have a reduced use of PVC and BFRs, and a few monitor models that are free of these substances. Lenovo has two models available that are PVC and BFR-free. HP is trailing behind, and has yet to bring out models with even a reduced use of PVC and BFRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While HP and Dell have yet to set a new timeline for completely eliminating these substances from all their products, Lenovo has delayed its deadline to the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Two-step detox for companies: Come clean, go green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, now in its 11th update, shows which electronics companies are investing to meet their commitments to remove toxic substances from their products, tackle climate change, and introduce better recycling and take-back policies. When electronics companies pay for the collection (take-back) and recycling of their own products, they have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple can do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple doesn't have certified PVC-free power cords yet, but in every other way its products are now PVC and BFR free. If Apple can do it, then so should the other leading PC manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe all electronics companies should have at least one toxic-free line of products on the market by the end of the year. Acer currently remains committed to phasing out PVC and BFRs in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philips springing forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guide to Greener Electronics star this time goes to Philips -- and the 47,000 people who sent emails to the company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch electronics giant reacted to our e-waste campaign with a dramatic about-turn on recycling and take-back. It's jumped from 15th to 4th place in one go. Following public pressure, the company has significantly improved its position on taking financial responsibility for the recycling of its products when they become e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips still needs to implement a system to make it work, but &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/"&gt; we're delighted with the direction it's heading in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individual producer responsibility is the gift that keeps giving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present and how easy products are to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "pay for the mess you make" approach is called "Individual producer responsibility", and it's crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Change on the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an overall slump in scores in the toxics categories, companies are starting to improve their scores on energy criteria. IT is a key sector in the fight against climate change and could enable emissions reductions of 15 percent of business-as-usual by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung joins Philips in publically demonstrating support for global steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to tackle climate change. Dell and Nokia join HP and Philips in making commitments to substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies are now increasing their use of renewable energy, with Nokia already sourcing a quarter of its electricity use from renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate challenge to IT execs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing electronics companies to public pressure is helping to green the industry. They could do much more, not only to clean up their own act, but to help the planet avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climateleaders"&gt;the IT Climate Leadership Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The aim this year is simply to get influential IT execs to lobby key governments for a strong, planet-saving agreement at the December 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we can't see anybody in the IT industry using their access to politicians -- and their influence as major employers and wealth creators -- to lobby for a strong Copenhagen deal. Meanwhile dirty industries are lobbying like there's no tomorrow. So we'll soon launch an international "who's who" and "who's doing what" of top IT execs we want to see leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, we accept no money from governments or corporations. Greenpeace runs on the donations of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>New: Google Earth tour of rainforest victory for climate</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/google-earth-soy-300909/</url><text>
	In collaboration with the Danish government and others, Google is launching a series of Google Earth layers and tours to allow you to explore the potential impacts of climate change on our planet and possible solutions.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Soya field. It is illegal in Brazil to destroy Brazil nut trees so they are left standing when the forest is cleared.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week a set of tours, narrated by Al Gore, gave an idea of what the world might look like in 2050 if we do nothing to stop global warming. This week, Google launches another set of climate change tours, including one by Greenpeace telling a success story about what can happen when we take action for solutions today: the moratorium on new soya plantations in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the soya moratorium in Brazil is a tale of one small but significant step toward saving the Amazon and, with it, our planet's climate.  Tropical deforestation accounts for up to a fifth of greenhouse gasemissions, more than all the world's airplanes, trains and cars. It hasled Brazil to become the world's fourth worst climate polluter andmeans that runaway climate change cannot be averted unlessdeforestation is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we took action in 2006 to try and stop one of the biggest drivers of Amazon deforestation in Brazil: the clearing of rainforest to make way for more and more soya plantations to feed Europe's growing hunger for fast food.  It's a tale that involves Greenpeace researchers, unlikely corporate bedfellows, action under the canopy and beneath the golden arches of McDonalds, and you, our supporters, who helped build consumer pressure that could not be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://mw1.google.com/mw-weather/outreach/cop15tours/soya/soya.kmz"&gt; watch the tour in Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; if you have it, or here on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;YouTurn the (Google) Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to &lt;a href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/google-earth-tar-sands.kmz"&gt; view the Canadian tar sands&lt;/a&gt; as an angel would see them -- an oily, blackened, treeless scar upon the planet's face -- or take an eagle-eye view of the magnificent forests they are destroying, Google Earth is a great tool for bearing witness both to our planet's natural majesty and the marks humanity has made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we launched a Global Awareness layer in partnership with Google which bundles  images, video, and information about saving our planet's forests, stopping climate change, and protecting our oceans into every copy of Google Earth.  (What's that? You're a Google Earthling and you've never seen it? Turn on your sidebar with Ctrl-Alt-B, then click on Layers &amp;gt; Global Awareness &amp;gt; Greenpeace)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has also launched a &lt;a title="google cop15 channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/cop15" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; called "Raise your Voice" dedicated to the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December, where you can join celebrities and activists in sending your own video message to the world leaders that will gather there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos will be broadcast on screens aroundthe conference in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how many world leaders will be there to see those messages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, only Gordon Brown (UK), Donald Tusk (Poland) and Jan Peter Balkenende (the Netherlands) have even committed to go to the summit.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a moment to turn the Earth in the right direction?  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit/call-for-copenhagen"&gt; Give those leaders a phone call to demand they attend the climate summit&lt;/a&gt; and take personal responsibility for ensuring a fair, ambitious,  binding deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit/call-for-copenhagen"&gt;Call a world leader or sign our petition demanding that they personally attend the Copenhagen Climate Summit and sign a fair, ambitious, binding deal to stop global warming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists in Italy chained themselves to a shipment of illegally logged azobé ‘blood timber’ in Italy’s Ravenna port, hanging banners reading “African Forest Crime” and “Forest Destruction = Climate Change.” We also took action outside the Colosseum at one Rome’s busiest Metro stations, hanging a giant banner with the message “Forest Destruction Sponsored by Me.Tro”  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/ravenna-port-italy-activists.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/ravenna-port-italy-activists.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ravenna port, Italy. Activists chain themselves to illegally logged 'blood timber' from Liberia. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cargo of 'blood timber' comes from Liberia, where it was illegally taken during the civil war. It is planned for use in upgrading Rome's metro system. Unsurprisingly, this had not been communicated to metro passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeace_italia/"&gt;So we exposed it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This truly is blood timber. During Liberia's decade's long civil war, the then president Charles Taylor exploited the country's tropical forests, handing them over in exchange for money and arms. As Chiara Campione from Greenpeace Italy said, "this blood timber has fuelled destruction, war and climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rome - a forest friendly city?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the azobé was bought by Italian company Interwood Srl, which recently won a €720,000 contract with Me.Tro Roma Spa, the company responsible for upgrading Rome's metro system. They plan to use it to maintain the train tracks, including replacing the sleepers, in Rome's A and B metro lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing illegally logged timber to be used for public transport works contradicts the Municipality of Rome's 2002 commitment to the Greenpeace campaign for "Forest Friendly Cities." As a signatory it promised to establish criteria to ensure companies carrying out public works could guarantee any timber they used came from legal and sustainable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asking companies to bid for the metro upgrade project, Me.Tro Roma did not include a single requirement that the timber used was guaranteed to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Italy must stop funding forest destruction, and start funding climate protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropical deforestation is responsible for 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Ending forest destruction is one of the fastest and easiest ways to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy is one of the biggest gateways in Europe for illegally logged timber. It is way past time the government stopped funding forest destruction and instead started doing something to save the climate by committing to fund forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've calculated that the EU and other rich nations that contribute the most to the climate crisis owe a carbon debt of at least €110 billion a year. By 2020, this money must be given to a fund to help developing countries, including Liberia, adapt to climate change and reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions by protecting their forests and developing clean energy. Italy's fair share of this carbon debt is at least €4 billion a year by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liberia must end blood timber trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also telling Liberian president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf that she must protect her country's precious forest resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The azobé shipment sent to Italy exposes fundamental holes in the management of the Liberian Forest Development Agency (FDA). The sustainable development institute briefing the &lt;a href="http://www.illegal-logging.info/uploads/TheHuntersWhistle.pdf"&gt; "Hunter's Whistle"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shows how the FDA authorised the shipment to Italy despite it contravening Liberian law on numerous occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liberian parliament is the in the process of considering three forest management contracts. We urge the Liberian government not to put the country's forests into the hands of logging companies - the result will devastate the country's development and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;Deforestation is responsible for 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Support Greenpeace's campaign to cut emissions, not trees. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mediocrity is not an option for climate deal</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/G20-230909/</url><text>
	With the international climate negotiations and the climate system both in crisis, more than 100 Heads of State and Government gathered at UN HQ in New York yesterday to try to break the deadlock and move the discussions forward. But despite promising science-based emissions cuts from Japan and China, an agreement on a fair and binding deal at Copenhagen this December is still at risk.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/an-activist-stands-on-a-miniat.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists come together in New York to urge decision makers to take action on climate this week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last time that world leaders could discuss climate change before Copenhagen and this meeting could have been a place for leadership and responsibility for the Copenhagen outcome. It should have provided the guidance to negotiators that can break the logjam in the climate negotiations. It could have been the place where trust was rebuilt and momentum generated as they head toward the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - just one day away. And it should have been the place where money was placed on the table that developing countries need to adapt to climate change, switch to a clean energy future and protect their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama needs to show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just 10 weeks to go before the Copenhagen meeting, there are no concrete sums for developing country finance, no clarity about how forests will be protected and for the most part - totally inadequate emissions cuts on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Obama's speech" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23obama.text.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt; did not mention the key issues that are stalling international negotiations: he failed to offer specifics about financial support for developing countries to adapt to and mitigate climate changd and he neglected US mid term targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast &lt;a title="China announces plans to cut emissions" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-china-us-united-nations" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China will cut emissions&lt;/a&gt; by a 'notable margin' below 2005 levels by 2020. This, along with their earlier announcements and actions, demonstrates that China is willing to do its fair share. And &lt;a title="Japan's emerging leadership" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090922f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Japan's new government has emerged as a leader&lt;/a&gt; by proposing to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (below 1990 levels). Although this falls short of what is needed, and there are no details yet as to how it will be achieved, it provides a glimpse of the kind of what climate change leadership could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised countries especially the US hold the key to changing the dynamic here. They have the technology and the money. After 20 years of negotiations, with emissions continuing to grow, the world is weary of excuses and compromises. &lt;a title="half hearted efforts" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a1cLRPV94TIg" target="_blank"&gt;Half-hearted efforts&lt;/a&gt; will result in global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C -- which will lead to catastrophic climate change. It's time to stop talking - and start taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together China and Japan's announcements challenge Obama to increase US commitments. Cuts of at least 25 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2020 are needed from the US, and a minimum of US$ 56 billion annually is required to help developing countries adapt to climate change, end deforestation and switch to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just one day's pause, the next key opportunity for Heads of State to break the impasse on progress towards reaching a strong climate deal in Copenhagen comes at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where climate finance is on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, Ban Ki Moon's summit in New York brought the climate crisis more to the attention of world leaders. And with an official invitation for them to personally attend the Copenhagen meeting - issued by the Danish Prime Minister - it is certainly no longer on their shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not often we as leaders get a chance to chart out a new course for our planet. One of these rare moments is coming up this December. At COP 15 in Copenhagen we have choice to make. The moment will be in our hands. We can either seize it or we can let it go. Whatever we chose their is no doubt that future generations will judge us on our ability to make COP 15 a decisive moment of change"[...] "December is the time, Copenhagen is the venue. I welcome you all to COP 15". -- H.E Mr. Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Voices for Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week - people from many different organisations and communities have come together to give world leaders a global wake up call. A host of events kicked off around the world including flash mobs of people phoning their leaders from the streets and over a thousand people formed &lt;a title="Human hourglass" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/09/global_climate_wake_up_call.html"&gt;a human hourglass&lt;/a&gt; in Central Park, New York - urging decision makers to take action on climate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four women activists from Africa, the Pacific and the US have witnessed the effects of climate change first hand - are in New York this week calling for action. These women have either lost their homes, jobs or food supply to flooding, droughts and other disasters that are now becoming increasingly more frequent as a result of climate change. But they are taking action to rebuild their lives and they are now speaking out for their communities and their families. They are joined by over 1 million people across the world who have called on their leaders to sign a &lt;a title="TckTckTck" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/tcktcktck-campaign-interview.php" target="_blank"&gt;fair, ambitious and binding deal&lt;/a&gt; in December. World leaders need to listen - and not let international bureaucracy get in the way of averting a global catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;the UN Summit in Copenhagen is only 10 weeks away, tell world leaders to take personal responsibility for the climate by attending this year and ensuring a fair deal for all of us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;In order to maintain our independence we don't accept cash from corporations or governments. This means we rely on individuals like you to continue working towards a safer climate for everyone. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate meeting in Bonn: leaders wanted</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-meeting-bonn-290309/</url><text>
	When the future of the world is at stake, the last thing you need is a politician. You need a real leader.  And that's our challenge to governments attending the first round of international climate talks in Bonn.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/can-a-billion-mouseclicks-save.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2002/6/can-a-billion-mouseclicks-save.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Urgent: leaders wanted.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks are the first in a series of negotiations this year culminating at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December.  That meeting may well be viewed in decades to come as the most important gathering of world leaders of this century.  It's the place where a global deal to prevent runaway climate change will either be agreed, or we will all face the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game on: the planet is the prize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race to forge a deal by the end of the year begins now. We need to see governments come off the starting blocks like cheetahs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We marked the opening of the Bonn climate talks with a demonstration outside the meeting featuring a giant balloon depicting a globe on fire.  It was surrounded by 60 people on bicycles and a banner reading "Urgent: climate leaders wanted." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key agenda items for Bonn is agreement on an overall mid-term emissions reduction target for the group of developed countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hu goes first? I don't know, you tell me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries especially need to end the ridiculous "after you'" charade that they have been engaged in for the last decade and simply agree to cut emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When US President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao meet for the first time at the G20 in the UK, the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters will have an opportunity to demonstrate their committment to leadership in a common cause -- or to continue the game of demanding the other commit first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint US/China commitment to finding climate solutions, including securing the necessary funding and a call to other world leaders to join them, could be the critical step that breaks the stalemate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all roads lead to Copenhagen. Every signal, every deal, every move on the table now will shape that crucial agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the world needs now is NOT love, sweet love.  It's action on climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we want out of the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen in December? Nothing short of a plan to save the planet: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global emissions to peak by 2015 and decline rapidly thereafter reaching as close to zero as possible by mid-century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed countries, as a group, to reduce emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels). At least three quarters of these reductions must be achieved domestically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries to reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The establishment of a funding mechanism to stop deforestation and associated emissions in all developing countries by 2020, with key areas (Amazon, Congo Basin and the Paradise Forests in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) achieving zero deforestation by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more detail about what we're demanding, and what we think the state of play is now, &lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/3/bonn-climate-talks-demands.pdf"&gt; have a look at our briefing document, "What's on the table in Bonn?" &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Become a climate activist. Sign up for our alert network, and you become one of a 3-million-strong, global force for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, we accept no money from governments or corporations.  Greenpeace runs on the donations of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In a “historic announcement” today delivered from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, “President Obama” has vowed to end the climate crisis by committing to legally binding, timely and deep emissions reductions that are ambitious, equitable and fair. “Obama” also committed to funding for mitigation and adaptation, and has pledged billions in funds to save forests.

            Faux-bama, Ilhan Anas, an Indonesian look-alike of United States President Barack Obama, holds a poster of the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short but momentous speech was the declaration that climate change activists around the world have been waiting for - except that it was delivered by 'Faux-bama' and not Obama: Ilham Anas, 34, is an Indonesian look-alike of the US President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His speech was delivered in a creative action organized by &lt;a title="southeast" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/obama-vows-to-end-climate-cr" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the global &lt;a title="tcktcktck" href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; activities to call on world leaders to act on climate change, ahead of the climate session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this September 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real President Obama will make an address at the UNGA, while the 'Faux-bama' address was aimed at securing his attendance at the UN Climate Summit in December which is not yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Obama for Copenhagen!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama and other world leaders have an opportunity to show climate leadership at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December. It is the best chance we have to avoid runaway climate change and the devastating consequences - world leaders must agree to a just and binding deal that will create significant reductions in world emissions and halt deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few challenges facing the world are more urgent than combating climate change. Many of you are working to confront this challenge. I am committed to working on this with you.I will attend the Copenhagen Climate Summit.I will ensure an ambitious, fair and binding global climate treaty.I will make funds available for climate mitigation and adaptation, starting with funds to protect the remaining forests.This is our chance to build a new future for our children. I will not let this moment pass us &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A "new epoch of sea-ice melt"</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/new-epoch-sea-ice-180909/</url><text>
	The minimum area of summer Arctic sea-ice extent was reported this week to have plummeted to the third-lowest level in recorded history. This is Earth's way of saying that we're reaching the limits of what the planet can sustain. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/polar-bears-on-an-ice-shelf-m.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polar Bears on an ice shelf. Mother and cub.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic sea-ice reached its yearly minimum low on September 12th, according to the US &lt;a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2009/091709.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest ever extent was recorded in 2007, and the second lowest in 2008. While these are signs that the greenhouse effect is real and requires urgent action, some people are still in denial - see the message on the NSIDC's twitter feed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/sea-ice-extent/" target="_blank"&gt;minimum sea-ice extents &lt;/a&gt;are more than records -- they are a call for attention to world leaders about the devastation that is happening all over the world due to climate change. We really need to reduce carbon emissions immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earth is losing its "climate control"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens in the great North goes way beyond the polar circle. When the sea-ice melts, it triggers several feedback loops. The first is greater heat absorption -- without the white sea-ice to reflect the sun, more heat is asorbed in the ocean, making it warm faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4x49ZW"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/9/twitter-quote.png" alt="Twitter" width="420" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second feedback loop is the disappearance of old, thicker sea-ice. The ice that melted this year will be replaced during the winter by new ice, less thick, which melts more easily the next summer. Simply put, the more ice melts, the less control we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New epoch of sea ice melt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/about/ships/the-arctic-sunrise/" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/a&gt; is currently in the Fram Strait, in the Arctic region, and approaching the ice edge. On board is world-class sea-ice expert Dr. Peter Wadhams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're entering a new epoch of sea-ice melt in the Arctic Ocean due to climate change," said Dr. Peter Wadhams. "In five years' time most of the sea-ice could be gone in summer, with just an 'Alamo of ice' remaining north of Ellesmere Island. In 20 years' time, that will also be gone, leaving the Arctic Ocean completely ice-free in summer. It's clear we can't rely on current models of prediction for sea-ice melt, as they have been constantly outpaced since the 1980s."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders: Act now!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the time for action is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, not just in five years, when it will be too late to keep feedback effects under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's needed is a 40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 on the part of developed countries. They also need to invest US$ 140 billion per year to help developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change, stop deforestation and switch to a low carbon economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do anything less is to ignore the warnings we're seeing in the Arctic and elsewhere that tell us that the climate is in serious peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we want world leaders to show their commitment to stop the devastating effects of climate change now,and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0" target="_blank"&gt;attend the Copenhagen climate conference at the end ofthe year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Patience for global leaders is wearing thin as Arctic sea ice. Ask them to get a move on and go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work. Consider making a donation to help us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today embarked on an extraordinary 15-day journey with five elephants, to call upon world leaders, and Barack Obama in particular, to demonstrate audacious leadership and take immediate action to avert climate chaos. We all know that politicians can forget their promises, but an elephant never forgets.

            Elephants take Thai Buddhist monks to bless the Greenpeace Chang(e) Caravan.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chang for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chang(e) Caravan, was launched at a colourful ceremony on
the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, a UNESCO world heritage
site, and one of the last refuges of the Asian elephant. Chang,
Thai for Asian elephant, is facing imminent extinction due to loss
of forest cover. When an elephant's habitat is gone, it's gone:
they can't just pack their trunks and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared
regions to cope with the impacts of climate change. Likewise, the
&lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0"&gt;Asian
Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, along with almost 20 percent of world's biodiversity
in the region, is severely threatened by relentless deforestation
which in turn magnifies climate change impacts," said Von
Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately despite the science and the obvious signs, world
leaders are reluctant - even unwilling - to act. It is time for
President Obama to take responsibility and deliver on the change he
promised. He has a second chance to make history again. And that
opportunity could be the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
New York on September 22," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

The Chang(e) Caravan&lt;/a&gt;, led by elephants rehabilitated by the
Thai Elephant Research and Conservation Fund (TERF), is a &lt;a href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;TckTckTck&lt;/a&gt; initiative. Tck Tck Tck
involves a growing number of organisations mobilising civil society
and galvanising public opinion in support of profound change and
rapid action to save the planet from the devastation effects of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 15-day journey, a people's caravan for change, will traverse
the vast Central Plains of Thailand, from Khao Yai National Park to
the outskirts of Bangkok. The city is the venue of a crucial UNFCCC
(United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change) meeting
ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Time is running out. A strong climate treaty will not only
reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help
us tackle the world's most urgent issues - energy security, food
security, water security and protection of our last remaining hope,
biodiversity on planet Earth," said Tara Buakamsri, campaign
manager of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions - and that is the real elephant in the room. The
plight of the Asian Elephant is the plight of the rest of the
world. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/"&gt;
If developed countries do not help developping countries to face
the challenges raised by climate change&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the end
for one of the world's biggest mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting the elephant by protecting its forest home means
protecting the entire ecosystem on which the entire human species
is also dependent. Developing countries are in urgent need of
assistance and aid from developed countries to stop deforestation.
However, they must also strictly enforce national laws to protect
the elephants and their forest habitat," said Alongkot Chukaew,
Executive Director of TERF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts
can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after
2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees
Celsius. Greenpeace is urging developed countries, as a group, to
agree to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/"&gt;
cut emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
Deforestation, one of the main contributors to climate change, must
stop by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Global leaders hold the fate of the Asian elephant in their hands. Ask them to go to Copenhagen and sign a fair, ambitious, and binding deal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on individual donations to support our work.

	Today we're celebrating Southeast Asia's rich heritage of rice cultivation with a giant organic work of art -- and reminding governments to protect our most important food crop from the threats of genetic engineering and climate change.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The art of rice cultivation has been perfected over thousands of years 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Rice Art' occupies an area of 16,000 square metres and
depictsfarmers wearing straw hats and using sickles to harvest rice
-reflecting the traditions and way of life of rice farmers. We
plantedour work of art in Thailand's Central Plains - an area
recognised asone of Southeast Asia's most fertile rice producing
regions -- with &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/hands-off-our-rice/"&gt;
two colours of organic rice&lt;/a&gt;. One is an irrigated local rice
variety which appears green from above, and the second is a
traditional black rice variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rice is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is inextricably linked with the culture and way of life of
peoplein Southeast Asia and this rich rice heritage must be
protectedthrough sustainable rice farming. The best way to do this
is tosafeguard rice against risky 'technologies' like
geneticengineering, and invest in productive and ecological farming
methodsthat are not dependent on harmful chemical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmentsin Southeast Asia should issue an outright ban on GE
(geneticallyengineered) crops, particularly GE rice. GE crops
threaten farmers'livelihoods and pose irreversible damage to the
environment. Because thecorporate backers of GE rice encourage
monoculture plantations whichreduce diversity, GE crops increase
the risk to worldwide riceproduction posed by global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is themost important food crop in Southeast Asia -
accounting for around 25percent of the total world rice production
in 2008. But rice productionin countries such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand facesthreats from profit-driven bio-tech
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farming in the face of climate change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the world's leading agricultural producer -
but atthe same time it is incredibly vulnerable to disasters caused
byclimate change. &lt;a href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/economics-climate-change-sea/default.asp"&gt;
An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released last
April&lt;/a&gt;revealed that if global action is not taken, climate
change will causea serious decline in rice production in countries
such as Indonesia,the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climatechange will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide. Food
security inmany countries is under threat from unpredictable
changes in rainfalland more frequent extreme weather. Seventy
percent of the world'sextreme poverty is found in agricultural
areas where farmers depend onrain for their harvests - where too
much or too little rain spellsdisaster. Governments need to
recognise that agriculture isparticularly vulnerable to climate
change and they must ensureadaptation strategies are based on
sustainable agricultural techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report "&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/food_security_and_climate_change_dec08/"&gt;
Food Security and Climate Change"&lt;/a&gt;we review recent scientific
studies that underline the most effectivestrategy to adapt
agriculture to climate change - increasingagricultural
biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is
a proven and highly reliable farming method to increaseresilience
to erratic weather changes. And, the best ways to increasestress
tolerance in single varieties are modern breeding technologiesthat
do not entail genetic tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition tosafeguarding agriculture against climate change -
it is essential torecognise that agriculture itself is one of the
largest emitters ofgreenhouse gases. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/cool-farming-full-report/"&gt;
'Cool Farming'&lt;/a&gt;report details the destructive practices
resulting from industrialagriculture and presents workable
solutions to help reduce itscontribution to climate change. These
practical changes will benefitthe environment as well as farmers
and consumers throughout the worldwithout the use of dangerous
genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare campaigning for GE-free crop and food production grounded
on theprinciples of sustainability, protection of biodiversity, and
providingall people access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic
engineering isan unnecessary and unwanted technology that
contaminates theenvironment, threatens biodiversity and may pose

<item><language>en</language><title>Illegal genetically modified organisms found in Germany</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/illegal-genetically-modified-o/</url><text>
	Residents of Germany, (and the rest of you Europeans) watch your breakfast! We've just learned there's a secret genetically-engineered ingredient in some of your food that shouldn't be there. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Linseed.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal genetically-engineered linseed (also known as flaxseed) from Canadian fields has been found in some of Germany's baked goods and cereal, according to the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linseed, which was never commercially grown in Canada, contains an antibiotic-resistant and herbicide-tolerant gene and has not been approved in the European Union. Though linseed is not a staple food, it is a widely-used health-food and can be found in baked goods, cereal and oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a test conducted by the German federal state Baden-Württemberg, 39 percent of the samples were found to be contaminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Germany today &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.de/themen/gentechnik/nachrichten/artikel/greenpeace_weist_nach_illegaler_gen_leinsamen_in_broetchen_und_muesli-1/"&gt;released the results of their research&lt;/a&gt; finding genetic contamination in products such as bread, cereals, baking mixes and in whole and crushed linseed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without knowing it, the German population has become guinea pigs," stated Alexander Hissting, one of our experts on Genetic Engineering (GE). This proves, yet again, that once released into nature, genetically engineered constructs are uncontrollable and cannot be recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German  Federal State has already announced that the linseed contamination is a European problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling for world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to recognise that the only effective protection from the uncontrolled spread of genetically modified organisms is a worldwide ban on their cultivation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Germans should be made aware of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.de/fileadmin/gpd/user_upload/themen/gentechnik/UEbersicht_Analyseergebnisse_Leinsaaten_10.9.2009_final.pdf"&gt;which brands have been affected by the infected linseed&lt;/a&gt;, and those products should be taken off the shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand against genetically modified organisms. There is insufficient scientific research on their effects on the environment and human health. Genetic engineering is a threat to biodiversity as GE plants can spread and infect natural strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linseed is a widely-used health-food and can be found in baked goods, cereal and oil.  68 percent of Canadian-grown linseed is exported to Europe, and a proposed ban on the import of the seed would be devastating to Canadian farmers.  This strain is illegal for commercial growth in Canada, which has led to questions as to how the contamination could have occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the latest example of this type of contamination: in 2006, unapproved GE rice spread all over the world, and earlier this summer, shipments of American soybeans containing traces of GE corn were blocked before entering Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;What's next? The Genetic Engineering industry wants all the rice in China. Don't let them have it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>What's inside your box of Kleenex?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/kleenex-forest-destruction/</url><text>
	What’s it take to get the makers of Kleenex to protect forests as vigilantly as they protect profits? Kimberly-Clark, the parent company of Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, and Viva, will be holding its annual shareholder meeting in Dallas at the end of April 2009, and we plan to be there to push for forest protection. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/kleenex-wiping-away-canadian.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2005/1/kleenex-wiping-away-canadian.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kleenex - wiping away Canadian forests, one sheet of toilet paper at a time
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the run up to the meeting, we’ll be focusing a lot of attention on Kimberly-Clark's destructive business practices, starting with a video  entitled "What’s inside your box of Kleenex?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is that every box of Kleenex is filled with ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark doesn’t use recycled content in most of its consumer paper products, and the “What’s inside your box of Kleenex?”video shows just how much forest destruction Kimberly-Clark is packing into every box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue Guide provides consumers with alternatives to Kimberly-Clark’s forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We released the Greenpeace Recycled Tissue and Toilet Paper Guide in February to help consumers find alternatives to Kimberly-Clark’s forest-destroying products. The story was picked up by the &lt;a title="NYT: Mr. Whipple Left it Out" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/science/earth/26charmin.html?_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="The Guardian: American taste for soft toilet roll 'worse than driving Hummers'" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/26/toilet-roll-america" target="_blank"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and other media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark continues to wipe away ancient forests to make disposable products because the company does not have a comprehensive plan for protecting forests. The company itself has admitted that recycled fiber can provide “the product softness and quality consumers have come to expect from the Kleenex brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why doesn't Kimberly-Clark have a plan that ensures it's not buying any virgin fiber from the Boreal or any other endangered forests? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark’s annual shareholder meeting brings executives, boardmembers, and shareholders together to chart a course for the company over the next year. It is the most important meeting Kimberly-Clark holds, so we plan on sending a strong message about protecting forests. You can help get that message through, and let Kimberly-Clark know it's time they made forest protection as integral to their plans as profit protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://usactions.greenpeace.org/action/start/236/"&gt;Send a letter to Kimberly-Clark and let them know that you'll only use recycled products, like those found in our tissue guide, until they cleans up their act.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Greenpeace can criticize companies like Kimberly-Clark because we don't take money from Kimberly-Clark. In fact, we take no money from any corporations or governments, to ensure that independence.  That means we rely on small donations from people like you. Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Rouge Alert: Climate change threatens French wine</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/french-wine-climate040909/</url><text>
	Climate change would drive anyone to drink, but it seems that the drink won't be a nice French Pinot Noir. France, famous for its unique wine varieties, stands to lose an important part of its cultural heritage as rising temperatures impact vineyards. And unless world leaders can ensure an ambitious deal on climate change at the upcoming UN summit in Denmark - French wines face a grim future.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/9/if-temperatures-increase-beyon-3.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            "Where there is no wine there is no love." -- Euripides
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/impacts-of-climate-change-on-w/"&gt; Our new report "The impacts of climate change on wine in France"&lt;/a&gt;details how French wine production is a climatically sensitive endeavour - and shows that it is at great risk from environmental change. For optimum quality each variety (like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir) is grown in specific regions within narrow climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the climate is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average annual temperature hassignificantly increased, leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar. The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines. Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids - which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavour and heavier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, many French vineyards experienced these changes, producing grapes with these undesirable characteristics. Scientists predict that at the end of this century half of all summers could be like the summer of 2003. Other expected impacts are the increased risk of frost in spring, disease, and rotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes put France's 'wine producing pedigree' at risk. Given current emission levels, we are on the path to an increase in temperatures of 4 to 6°C between now and 2100. Such a climate scenario would lead to a displacement of vines 1,000 km beyond their traditional limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24981/if-temperatures-increase-beyon.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great French wines derive their finesse and elegance from their terroir. Terroir alludes to a very specific combination of climate and a well defined territory, sometimes no bigger than a single plot of land. It is the combination of these characteristics, together with age-old practices and know-how, which produces exceptional wines. Relocating vineyards simply will not result in the same wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture that has taken centuries to build is now inperil and might even disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine, of course, is the result of a climate, a soil, a human tradition. And it is very sensitive. The most minor change will affect its aromatic expression: its colour, its complexity (...) Burgundy is famous for its well-balanced fine wines: their maturity, acidity and mineral composition. This is what we will &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;lose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnaud Immele (Oenologist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading figures from the French wine and food industries have joined us to urge the French government to push for a strong global agreement at the &lt;a href="http://en.cop15.dk/"&gt;United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in December, warning that failure to cut greenhouse gases will devastate their sector. To survive, French wines needed an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, said the group, which includes chefs Marc Veyrat and Jean-Luc Rabanel and sommeliers Franck Thomas and Antoine Petrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group published an &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/08/11/le-rechauffement-climatique-menace-l-equilibre-des-terroirs-et-l-ame-de-nos-vins_1227562_3232.html"&gt; opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde&lt;/a&gt; - addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy - saying "We urge the president and environment minister of the world's top wine-making nation to act with exemplarity at the Copenhagen talks" in December [...] The jewels of our cultural heritage, French wines, elegant and refined, are today in danger," [...] "Changes in the climate are leavingour vineyards increasingly vulnerable. Summer heat waves, recent hail storms in the Bordeaux region, new diseases coming from the south - these disturbances will soon be much more serious, [...] Our winescould lose their soul," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bare necessities for wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned American artist Spencer Tunick will soon team up with our French office - inviting hundreds of people to pose nude in a human installation that is committed to raising awareness about climate change. The installation will take place in early October, in a vineyard in the south of Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers can already register online at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.fr/tunick"&gt;www.greenpeace.fr/tunick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to artist Spencer Tunick, "Whether it be vines, corn, wheator rice, agriculture's sustainability around the globe is being threatened by climate change. Mother Nature is losing to man's aggressive grip on the Earth. Sometimes we forget how connected the body is to the earth, as the world is turning into a concrete jungle. With my work, I hope to bring attention to the vulnerability of our existence and to our connections to the foods we consume, for pleasure and survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Tunick's artwork has challenged humankind's relationship with its environment for more than 15 years. All around the world, he has staged more than 75 large body landscapes in the heart of urban or natural settings, each time gathering hundreds or thousands of volunteer nude models. In 2007, he achieved an intense illustration of humankind's tragic relationship with the climate, rallying &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/naked-glacier-tunick-08182007/"&gt; 600 volunteers to pose naked on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Help protect French wine by asking world leaders to go to the UN Climate Summit in December and ensure a good deal for wine - and for the entire planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	There are 100 days remaining until the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, where urgent action is needed by world leaders in order to save our climate.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/8/a-child-poses-with-one-of-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's time to stop talking and start taking action
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have 100 days until Copenhagen. Greenpeace China displayed 100 children carved from ice at the Temple of Earth in Beijing today, to symbolise the "disappearing future" for the 1.3 billion people in Asia at risk of water shortage as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event, matched in India with another ice sculpture, marks the 100-day countdown before the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - where &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;we are urging governments&lt;/a&gt; to take strong, effective action to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting sculptures of100 children are made from Himalayan glacier water from the source of Yangtse, Yellow and Ganges rivers. The ice sculpture in India is a huge "100" on a World Map and was unveiled in New Delhi to show "the world washed away" by glacial melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate tipping point is unfolding in the Himalayas. The rapid melting of glaciers caused by global warming is jeopardising the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the 7 great rivers that originate in the region. If we cannot stop runaway &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, babies born today - at this moment - will face a very different reality when they grow up, where water availability would be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate faster than recorded for other glaciers anywhere in the world.  The IPCC suggests that glacier coverage will fall by at least 43 percent and possibly as much as 81 percent by the end of the century - depending on how effectively we act to restrain our greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India together account for one-third of the world’s population but both countries' water resources (per capita are far below the global average. The two largest developing countries share the challenge of balancing the goals of development and environmental protection. They must pursue a low-carbon development path if we are to avert environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global countdown to Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other parts of the world - our activists staged public events to highlight the number of days left for our leaders to take action. In Brazil, we set up large clocks in eight cities together with the &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign. In Belgium, 10,000 people formed a giant human banner in the shape of a big clock. Our team in Switzerland placed a giant banner on a retreating glacier saying '&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/08/our_climate_your_decision.html"&gt; Our Climate, Your Decision&lt;/a&gt;' and there was bike riding activity in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tcktcktck...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're proud to be part of the &lt;a title="Tcktcktck" href="http://tcktcktck.org/"&gt;Tcktcktck&lt;/a&gt; campaign this year. It's a global campaign for climate action, which has launched 100 days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, and brings together an unprecedented alliance of faith groups, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and individuals at this crucial time. We're working with Tcktcktck to &lt;a title="harnessing the voices of people from around the world" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/global-coalition-for-climate-a/climateorb/"&gt;harness the voices of people from around the world&lt;/a&gt; - calling for an ambitious, fair and binding international agreement that reflects the latest science.  As December's meeting in Copenhagen approaches, tcktcktck will organise around major international meetings and other relevant events to demonstrate the support from citizens around the world in having world leaders attend the negotiations in Copenhagen and produce an ambitious, fair and binding agreement. &lt;a href="http://www.tcktcktck.org/"&gt;www.tcktcktck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to take responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest scientific research shows catastrophic climate impacts can be averted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions after 2015 in order to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. We are urging developed countries, as a group, to agree to cut emissions by 40 percent below1990 levels by 2020. And developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With100 days until the most important meeting of our time, we're working together with other organisations as part of the global TckTckTck campaign to show that the world is ready for bold climate action. &lt;a title="We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;We're asking world leaders to ensure a fair, ambitious, and binding climate deal in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong climate treaty will not only reverse the march of dangerous climate change - it will also help us tackle the world's largest challenges. We will create millions of green jobs, reduce healthcare costs, lift millions out of poverty, and put &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; into thehands of everyday citizens in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next opportunity for world leaders to step up and show decisive leadership on averting a climate catastrophe will be at the UN General Assembly focusing on Climate, on September 22nd. &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/a/you-turn-the-earth/"&gt;Sign upto be a climate activist with us&lt;/a&gt; and find out what you can do to add your voice to this important process.

<item><language>en</language><title>Exposed! Big oil's dirty tricks </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-oil-tricks190809/</url><text>
	Following our exposure of a secret oil industry plan to fake public concern over US climate legislation - we're putting big oil companies in the spotlight to make sure nobody falls for their dirty tricks. The leaked memo from the American Petroleum Institute (API) revealed its request for members to have employees masquerade as concerned 'Energy Citizens' at rallies held across the US this month.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/8/aug-18-2009-greenpeace-act.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/8/aug-18-2009-greenpeace-act.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cut the crap! Climate change is the most pressing environmental crisis of our time.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attempt to deceive politicians and the public by forging a grassroots campaign (known as "astroturfing") was highlighted by &lt;a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/blog/greenpeaceusa_blog/2009/08/18/greenpeace_action_calls_out_climate_frau"&gt; our activists who laid real Astroturf outside the API headquaters in Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; They also held a sign reading "Climate fraud funded by big oil" and branded the Astroturf with the logos of oil giants ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game plan known&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/oil-memo/"&gt; The API memo, leaked to Greenpeace last week&lt;/a&gt;, called on the CEOs of some of the world's biggest oil companies to "indicate to your company leadership - your strong support for employee participation in the rallies." The API's President, Jack Gerard, further warns the world's oil barons to treat the memo as "sensitive," arguing that "we don't want our critics to know our game plan".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memo and the rallies are in direct contradiction to many of its members' stated support for "cap and trade" climate legislation in the US. Not only that, but the API was citing misleading economic statistics to back its campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Come clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scam makes a mockery of the public debate on climate action. Energy companies could be putting their workers to work on an energy revolution, rather than busing them out of their workplaces to attend bogus rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, over US$ 82 million has been spent on corporate lobbying including against climate change legislation, by the oil and gas industry alone. The CEOs and Presidents of API member companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, General Electric and others must publicly denounce these dirty tricks. They must make clear to Governments their support for strong climate action at the upcoming UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government climate and energy policy must be based on climate science and the genuine expression of public opinion - not vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN Climate Summit is rapidly approaching - in addition to calling on big oil to stop the lies - we're also asking for all Heads of State to show up to the meeting in Copenhagen this December - and take personal responsibility for a good climate deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We're only as strong as the people who support us. By giving what you can to support our activists, researchers, campaigners, political advisors and lawyers - you can help us stand up against the oil industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Philips back in the red again</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/philips-back-in-the-red161008/</url><text>
	Philips Electronics has long been in the red with a big fat zero on tackling e-waste in our Guide to Greener Electronics. Meanwhile, in Moscow’s Red Square, it is celebrating 110 years in Russia with its annual 'Sense and Simplicity' event. We did a spot of corporate gatecrashing to remind Philips that, after all these years, doing the right thing is still simple: take back and recycle. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/10/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Philips stands out as the company with the worst position on e-waste and recycling. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips stands out as thebiggest obstacle to tackling the
growing problem of old electronics (e-waste)being dumped in
developing countries. Not that you'll find any reference tosuch
details in Philips' marketing material. That's why we paid a visit
tohighlight the real consequences of Philips' position. In fact, we
discoveredthat never mind simply not mentioning the real truth,
Philips' public materialwas overflowing with elaborate wording
gushing over how responsible, healthyand sustainable Philips
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Circle of irresponsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a copyof Philips' greenwashed press packet in a trash
bin. It claims Philips' eventis all about a healthy lifestyle and
maintaining a sustainableenvironment. It talks about
responsibleconsumption and a shopping experience it calls the
"Circle of Life." Philipsclaims the concepts and products presented
at the event are about itscommitment to "health and well-being of
people across the globe" and to"collective well-being, and helping
to create a sustainable global society toprotect our environment
for future generations."&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If this is the case, then why does
Philipsfail to take back and recycling it products globally in
contrast to manycompetitors like Dell and Nokia? Why does it refuse
to accept the real costs oftheir own e-waste? Instead, Philips
promotes and actively lobbies forgovernments and public to
subsidise recycling its e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unhealthy People, Unhealthy Living, Unhealthy Planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips should takeresponsibility for its own products. If it is
really interested in a"sustainable global society", it should make
sure all of its products are collectedand not leave the burden of
cleaning up toxic e-waste on unprotected workers.E-waste can end up
in countries without recycling facilities and the recyclingworkers
treating the waste - often children - are exposed to a cocktail
oftoxic chemicals and poisons when the products are broken
apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unprotected workers in thee-waste dumps of China, India,
Pakistan and Ghana who end up dismantlingPhilips products are a
world away from Philips' 'Sense and Sensibility'marketing, but that
doesn't change the fact that Philips is the company whoseposition
is blocking real solutions to the problem. Watch the snap shot
ofpersonal stories of e-waste workers in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words healthy and sustainable certainly don't spring to mind
do they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other electronics producers, including Sony, Dell and
Lenovo,accept responsibility for their own products, supporting
'Individual ProducerResponsibility', and setting up free voluntary
take-back systems for theirproducts. Philips is lobbying against
the implementation of individual producerresponsibility, under
existing legislation and its adoption in futurelegislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weare calling on Philips to accept responsibility for its own
e-waste and to takeback and recycle its products in every country
where they are sold. It shouldpay for the recycling of its own
products.When producers pay the real recycling costs, they have an
incentive tostop using toxic materials in the design of their
products and make them moredurable and recyclable in order to lower
the recycling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Tell Philips to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from governments or corporations.

	The world’s largest food fishery is on the verge of collapse. Pollock, used to make McDonald’s fish sandwiches, frozen fish sticks, fish and chips, and imitation crabmeat, have had a population decrease of 50 percent since last year.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our appetite for fish is exceeding the oceans' ecological limits with devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. Scientists are warning that overfishing results in profound changes in our oceans, perhaps changing them forever.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling fish populations are largely due to the enormous
amounts of fish being removed from Alaska's Bering Sea. Factory
trawlers take over a million tonnes of pollock out of the ocean
each year. The fish can't reproduce and recover as quickly as they
are being fished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the financial institutions on Wall Street collapsed due
to poor oversight and mismanagement-the pollock fishery is on the
fast-track to collapse as well. In order to avoid a collapse, the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council must take swift and
decisive action when they meet in December to reduce catch levels
and put pollock back on the path to healthier population
levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Billion Dollar Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pollock fishery is a billion-dollar industry. These days, it
seems when you have that much money at stake, common sense gets
thrown out the window. Each year, fishery management wants to catch
the most fish to get to the most profit. They continue to fish,
even when warning bells are going off and science tells them its
time to cut back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how much pollock are they catching? Picture this- if the
pollock from the 2004 catch were laid end to end they would wrap
around the earth more than 38 times. Now, that's a lot of fish
sticks! Pollock are being fished excessively and cannot keep up
with the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four Alaska pollock stocks, two are now shut down
completely and a third is just a fraction of its former size.
Despite the warning signs, including five years in a row of low
juvenile survivorship, the industry has continued to target the
pollock spawning aggregation, taking huge numbers of pregnant
females before they release their eggs. This kind of fishing
practice only deepens the problem by not allowing pollock to
reproduce, grow and mature to reproduce again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bering Sea Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and conservationists have warned that unless the
Council reduces fishing pressure on Pollock - a vital forage
species for fur seals, whales, and endangered Steller sea lions -
the entire Bering Sea ecosystem could be in jeopardy of collapse.
This would prove devastating for the state's commercial fishermen
and traditional coastal communities that depend on a healthy ocean
for their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swift Action is Needed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing interests have no doubt played a huge role in shaping
the pollock fishery. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council
is dominated by fishing industry representatives. With exemptions
from conflict of interest laws, Council members regularly vote
against measures that would affect their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council will
set thenew pollock catch limits for 2009. In order to restore the
pollockfishery's health, the allowable catch must be cut in half,
fishing onspawning populations suspended, and marine reserves
established toprotect critical habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

	Illegal logging is rapidly destroying the Earth's stores of natural resources at a time when runaway climate change threatens life on every continent. However, a review of the legality of 156 logging contracts in Democratic Republic of Congo will put its ancient forests in peril, rather than protect them. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A woman from a forest dependant community gathers firewood. Approximately 40 million people in the DRC depend on the rainforest for their basic needs, such as medicine, food or shelter. Logging is seen by the World Bank and other donors as a way to alleviate poverty and promote economic development.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging titles have been under the microscope in DRC for three
years, under a review financed by the World Bank. Greenpeace has
been keeping watch to see if the review actually protects these
ever-diminishing tropical forests, rather than the loggers'
short-term profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday 6 October, the review was announced and at the same
time Environment Minister Jose Endundo made a public commitment to
extend the current moratorium. While the announcement of the
moratorium is good news, we fear that with such a flawed review,
the reality could be business-as-usual for unregulated logging in
the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legal precedents ignored&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, a moratorium stopped the allocation of new concessions
in DR Congo, in an effort to keep logging out of protected areas.
The Government then launched a review in 2005 to determine which
existing contracts could be converted to legal concessions under
the conditions of the Forest Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial findings released this week, the commission
responsible for the review has declared that logging can now take
place under 46 of the 156 contracts - including 33 that are illegal
titles obtained in breach of the 2002 moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very start, the terms of reference were flawed and
easily manipulated by companies with vested interests. For example,
the review's own Technical Working Group said that there was not
enough information on previous permit boundaries to judge whether
companies have been operating outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/DRC-logging-sector-briefing" target="_blank"&gt;briefing paper&lt;/a&gt; published today shows how more
destructive logging could occur on these concessions that were
obtained illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No social or environmental considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the terms were followed properly, the review would still
be woefully inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social conflicts are ever-present in these company's concession
areas - violations of human rights are the rule rather than the
exception. However, the review did not measure or even acknowledge
this aspect of logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without social and environmental criteria, the process ignores
both local people's livelihoods and the global significance of
tropical forest in stabilising climate change and protecting
biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft review findings were kept secret for over a week, only
circulated to the companies concerned and not to forest communities
who are immediately at risk from logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desperate need for good governance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss-German SIFORCO (owned by Danzer Group) and all the
subsidiaries of the Portuguese NST Group have seen the majority of
their titles approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our report &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/conning-the-congo/" target="_blank"&gt;Conning the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, we exposed how companies
like Danzer are cheating local people out of large amount of tax
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies are now promoting themselves as ready for
"sustainable certification" for European markets. In fact, they are
logging in intact forests, near biodiversity hotspots and exporting
masses of internationally protected tree species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we really expect them to do the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without basic regulation, it is impossible enforce the law or
trace the origin of logs - making a mockery of international
efforts to cut demand for illegal forest timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Environmental Minister has committed to extend the
current moratorium we urge the DRC government to turn this
commitment into a reality with a legally binding Presidential
decree. We also urge those nations who are active donors of the DRC
to provide support so that this decree can be properly implemented
and monitored while the country works to improve the governance in
the forest sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also time for alternatives given the scientific evidence
of the vital role forests play in stablising global climate change.
To protect the remaining Congo forests, we call for a participatory
land-use plan, based on the needs and rights of forest-dependent

	Greenpeace today embarked on the Indonesian leg of its "Forests for Climate" ship tour, to shine the spotlight on the rampant destruction of the Paradise Forests - the last remaining ancient forests of Southeast Asia.

            A group of Papuanese traditional dancers greets the Esperanza during a welcoming ceremony at Jayapura port.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; arrived in Jayapura, in the Indonesian
province of Papua, to an energetic welcome from a troupe of
traditional dancers, and local dignitaries - including the mayor of
Jayapura - gave their support to our campaign."Forests for Climate"
is not only the slogan for our Paradise Forests tour - it's also
the name of a &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/forests_for_climate_brochure/" target="_blank"&gt;landmark proposal&lt;/a&gt; Greenpeace has developed,
for an international funding mechanism toprotect tropical
forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just completed a six-week tour of neighbouring Papua New
Guinea, the &lt;i&gt;Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; will tour Indonesia starting with the
provinces of Papua and West Papua, which represent the last
frontier of intact ancient forests in the country. Over the next
six weeks, the ship will be touring the archipelago to document the
threats facing the forests of Papua and Sumatra as well as the
companies and politicians responsible. Also, we will be
highlighting the short and long-term solutions to the crisis so
these forests can be permanently protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one half of the remote and mountainous New Guinea island,
Papua contains the largest area of remaining forest in Indonesia -
with those of Sumatra and Kalimantan on the island of Borneo
largely gone or degraded, this really is the last frontier. The
region is home to hundreds of distinct tribes and clans with a
corresponding range of cultural diversity, and for biodiversity is
second to none, with animals and plants new to science being
recorded on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That alone makes the forests worth protecting, but we now
realise they're also vitally important when it comes to climate
change. Not only do the trees and soil act as huge carbon stores,
cutting them down also releases that carbon in the form of
greenhouse gases. Indonesia is the third largest emitter on the
planet, largely due to deforestation and its forests are
disappearing faster than anywhere in the world, so to prevent
climate change we have to save the forests, including those in
Papua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to do this is to place a moratorium on all deforestation
across Indonesia, which will provide the breathing space necessary
to work on plans to safeguard the future of these forests. The
Indonesian government is the one to lay down a moratorium, but it
also needs the palm oil industry to provide ministers the space to
do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/" target="_blank"&gt;the victory with our Dove campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier
this year, we have been working with companies such as Unilever to
build a coalition in favour of an immediate moratorium on forest
conversion for palm oil and insisting their palm oil suppliers do
not clear further forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of climate change are already being felt around the
world and we don't have long to prevent the worst predictions
becoming inevitable. We still have time if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

<item><language>en</language><title>Pirates blacklisted</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pirates-blacklisted031008/</url><text>
	Our oceans are being plundered by pirates. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing – also known as "pirate fishing" - has become a global scourge. From international waters around the world, to the islands of the South Pacific and the coastal communities of West Africa, fisheries are in crisis.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/piratefishing2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/4/piratefishing2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Pirate fishing can be stopped. Governments can outlaw flags of convenience and refuse entry to fishing and supply vessels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirates are pulling in billions of dollars of fish that
rightfully belongs to coastal communities or falls beyond any one
country's waters. Pirate fishing affects communities that cannot
afford to be robbed of their livelihoods, leaves the marine
environment bruised and battered, and undermines food security and
attempts at sustainable management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roll call&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official lists of pirate vessels are limited in the information
they contain and don't include the names of the big companies
behind these pirate fishing vessels. It's time for the truth: for
fish purchasers, retailers, and the public to see who's behind
pirate fishing, and for ship owners to start taking responsibility
in their role. Companies often have illegal and legal vessels
fishing side by side. It is time they pay the real price for piracy
and have all their operations held accountable when caught
pirate-fishing.  We've launched an online database of fishing
vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, and the companies who own them.   &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/" title="Pirate Blacklist"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our IUU blacklist is the first independent record of fishing
vessels, support vessels and companies involved in pirate fishing. 
It includes independent observations from the legal fishing
industry, government authorities, and first-hand evidence from
Greenpeace and other NGOs who have recorded the activities of these
vessels and companies at sea and in ports around the world.  The
new database supplements the existing IUU database that was
launched in 2007, which contained only those pirate fishing vessels
officially blacklisted by regional fisheries management
organisations and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging all retailers and seafood traders to ensure
they do not purchase pirate-caught fish and, as a first step,
ensure that they do not trade with companies listed as operators of
pirate vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a long-awaited display of responsibility, the European Parliament’s Environment committee has voted through a strong package to reduce emissions from cars. As the committee went into session, it seemed certain that a compromise package riddled with loopholes would be the one to pass. However, the MEPs voted to stick with meaningful legislation, turning their backs on nine months of lobbying by the car industry.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists from Greenpeace Spain climbed the Osborne Bull, an internationally known symbol of Spanish roads, to "protect" him from increasing CO2 emissions from cars.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, average fleet emissions from new cars, which
are currently around 158 grams &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be reduced to 130 grams/km by 2012&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Must fall further to 95 grams by 2020&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For every gram over the average a manufacturer will face fines
of 95 euro per car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal still has to pass the full EU Parliament and the
Council of Ministers. But this is now increasingly likely to
happen, and we'll be defending this package every inch of the
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as a huge blow to the car industry lobby, which
has shamelessly defended its right to drive climate change by
putting profits ahead of the climate. The lobby, led by Volkswagen,
Mercedes and BMW will now have to embrace a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory! Turkish nuclear plans powered down</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-turkish-nuclear-plans/</url><text>
	Just two days after the arrest of 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group protesting against nuclear energy in Turkey, there has been a victory. For months, the Energy Ministry of Turkey has been intent on selecting a supplier for its first nuclear energy plant. The plant would have been the first of a number the Turkish government says it wants to build. Instead, plans have been stopped dead in their tracks. It turns out energy companies just aren’t that interested in the risk of a new nuclear energy plant.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nuclear power presents unacceptable risks to life on this planet: its small contribution to power is far outweighed by its inherent dangers. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And the envelope please…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the government received envelopes from 6 companies
supposedly interested in building the new plant.  Only one envelope
actually held a bid for a new nuclear plant - the other five
contained a "thanks but no thanks" letter. Russian company
Atomstroyexport was the only one willing to roll the dice on
nuclear energy in Turkey. But, Turkish rules say that without
competition for the bid the government is unable to move ahead and
issue the tender for a new nuclear plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey might have been considering nuclear energy as a quick and
cheap fix to its energy needs but nuclear energy is anything but
quick or cheap. In addition to being extremely dangerous and dirty,
nuclear energy is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs
and construction time, companies just don't want to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for an Energy [R]evolution. Let's not fall
back on power from the past. We've come up with a plan to move from
a world powered by nuclear and fossil fuels to one running on
renewable energy. Download the blueprint for an Energy

	At 2am this morning, four Greenpeace activists boarded the Windsor Adventure, a coal cargo ship importing coal from Colombia into Spain. Activist painted “Quit Coal” on the side of the ship as it entered Gijon, one of the biggest coal harbours in Spain. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint the slogan 'Quit Coal' in English and Spanish onto the side of the Windsor Adventure, a coal cargo ship from Colombia to Spain. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government relies heavily on coal, the most
polluting of all fossil fuels, for the country's energy supply. 
The activists took action to call on to the government to quit coal
and switch to subsidising clean, renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Free Pass for Coal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government imports 24 million tonnes of coal and
pays €2,500 million in state aid to the coal industry every year,
more than the renewable energy industry receives. A third of the
world's CO2 emissions come from coal, yet the Spanish government,
like all EU countries, has granted the coal industry CO2 emissions
rights for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action comes one day before the European Parliament votes on
the EU's response to climate change. Greenpeace is calling on the
EU to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by
2020, and to vote for measures to block construction of over 50 new
coal-fired plants in Europe. The Spanish government talks about
tackling climate change while feeding subsidies right into the
industry that are causing it. The potential of renewable energy in
Spain is enormous and with the right investment, they can supply
all the electricity and even all the energy needed with
renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This autumn, the Greenpeace ships Rainbow Warrior and Arctic
Sunrise, are bringing the "Quit Coal" message to the Mediterranean
and Europe. The tour, from Israel to Poland, is taking place in the
run-up to UN climate negotiations in Poznan, Poland this December.
Quitting coal will be essential to a meaningful deal to save the
climate. European governments must show leadership by phasing-out
coal in their own countries.   &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" title="quit coal!"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about the Quit Coal tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's Energy [R]evolution shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by 5o percent, and deliver half the world's energy needs
by 2050. Download the blueprint for an Energy [R]evolution:&lt;/p&gt;

	Activists turned the front of the Turkish Ministry of Energy into a mortuary to highlight the deadly risks involved with establishing a nuclear industry in Turkey. On the eve of a nuclear tender from the Turkish government, 37 activists from Greenpeace and Global Action Group were arrested after they took to the street to protest the dangerous decision.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists were arrested after protesting the possible development of two new nuclear plants in Turkey.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists unfurled a banner demanding a "STOP" to nuclear energy
and laid themselves on the line with a "die in" on the street in
front of the ministry. The protest ended when the 37 activists were
arrested, but they were later released without charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is currently nuclear-free and is considering nuclear
energy as a quick and cheap fix to its energy needs.  But nuclear
energy is anything but quick or cheap. In addition to being
extremely dangerous and dirty, nuclear energy will be a huge
financial burden on the people of Turkey. Greenpeace is urging the
government to cancel the nuclear tender and invest in clean, safe
renewable alternatives and greater energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not quick but very dirty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the hundreds of billions of US dollars that have been
given to the global nuclear industry in the past fifty years, we
still haven't seen a solution to the issues raised by waste and
security problems. A nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes
of nuclear waste annually. This means an additional 12,000 - 14,000
tonnes of waste are added to the already existing stockpiles of
nuclear waste every year. After recent radiation leaks in Spain and
incidents at plants in France, Sweden and Japan, you can't help but
wonder just how close we are to another Chernobyl. France leads as
an example of how dangerous nuclear energy can be, with
approximately 900 incidents a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear: an economic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with not being able to deal with all the risks, nuclear
power is an economic disaster. Because of increasing costs and
construction time, companies do not want to invest. Neither the
World Bank nor the Asian Development Bank will give credits to the
nuclear projects on the grounds that they are too risky
financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means tax payers need to take the burden. The two nuclear
projects currently under construction in Turkey are about three
times over budget, and when the plants complete their lifetime,
decommissioning and cleaning will present yet another bill for the
taxpayer. It is unacceptable that the Turkish government wants to
spend its citizens hard-earned billions of liras on dirty,
dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for an Energy [R]evolution. Let's not fall
back on power from the past. We've come up with a plan to move from
a world powered by nuclear and fossil fuels to one running on
renewable energy. Download the blueprint for an Energy

	Company scores plummeted in the previous edition of Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, when new criteria on climate change were introduced. However, leading brands like Nokia and Samsung are now making significant progress in greening their electronics products, with improved environmental policies responding not only to these new energy criteria, but also to the more stringent chemical and e-waste criteria.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Boys burning electronic cables and other electrical components in order to melt off the plastic and reclaim the copper wiring. This burning in small fires releases toxic chemicals into the environment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Greener Electronics Guide&lt;/a&gt; is our way of
getting the electronicsindustry to take responsibility for the
entire lifecycle of theirproducts. We want them to face up to the
problem of e-waste and take onthe challenge of tackling climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in August 2006 and now in its &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/"&gt;
9th edition&lt;/a&gt;, the Guideranks the leaders of the mobile phone,
computer, TV and games consolemarkets according to their policies
and practices on toxic chemicals,recycling and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guide has been a key driving force in getting many companies
to make significant improvements to their environmental policies,
and it continues to provoke significant change in the industry.
Intel recently announced that its new Xeon 5400 processors use
transistors made from hafnium, thus avoiding the use of toxic 
Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs). Last week, we also saw the &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2008/greener-ipods-10092008/" target="_blank"&gt;announcement by Apple&lt;/a&gt; that its new line of
iPods would be free of BFRs, PVC and mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who's in the lead, and who's in need?&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" width="430" height="237"&gt;&lt;param name="width" value="430"&gt;

&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="430" height="237" quality="high" menu="false" src="/international/PageFiles/25124/ranking-guide-8th-edition.swf"&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring seven points out of ten, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nokia-rank-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; has regained the lead, due largely to
its &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/press/reports/take-back-blues" target="_blank"&gt;improved take-back practice in India&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-samsung-ra-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, a top scorer on the energy-efficiency
of its products, takes second place with 5.9 points. &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-fse-rankin/" target="_blank"&gt;Fujitsu Siemens Computers&lt;/a&gt; jumps to third place
with 5.5 points, having finally set late 2010 as its deadline for
eliminating toxic PVC plastic and all BFRs from across its product
range. Although &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-erics-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sony-ranki-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; - who enjoyed the top two positions in
the previous edition - rank fourth and fifth respectively this time
around, they remain in the top half of the ranking with scores of
5.3 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languishing at the bottom of the ranking is &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-sharp-rank-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; with 3.1, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-microsoft-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; with 2.2 points and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-nintendo-r-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, with only 0.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Toxic-free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want manufacturers to eliminate harmful chemicals in their
product design. While no company has, so far, released a computer
completely free of BFRs and PVC, several have recently launched
products with restricted amounts of toxic BFRs and PVC. Sony
Ericsson stands out, having banned hazardous chemicals such as
antimony, beryllium and phthalates since the beginning of the year.
All of its new models are PVC-free. Following the lead set by
companies like Sony Ericsson, and Nokia, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-apple-rank-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has also announced that its new line of
iPods will be free of BFRs, PVC and mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a first step towards Apple putting its money where its
mouth is: Apple committed to a complete phase-out of PVC and BFRs
from all of its products by the end of 2008. With the new iPods
being the cheapest models yet, this is clear proof that
high-performing electronics products can be affordable, popular and
effective without using toxic chemicals. A downside to Apple's new
iPod is its built-in obsolescence; because of the high costs to
replace the battery, new product purchase is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has positioned itself among the leaders on PVC and BFR
phase-out, but the iPod alone is not enough to increase its overall
score. A complete phase out of all toxic chemicals across its
entire product range would improve Apple's ranking, and the company
needs to improve its record on recycling and climate policy. We're
urging Apple to introduce a free, global recycling scheme like
rivals such as &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-dell-ranki-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Energy-efficient&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 8th edition of the Guide criteria to assess the
companies' performance in tackling climate change have been
introduced. The global Information and Communication Technology
industry is estimated to be responsible for approximately 2 percent
of global carbon dioxide (CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
emissions, and the rapid proliferation of energy-hungry electronic
gadgets is part of this. It's vital that the electronics industry
plays a leading role in producing more energy-efficient products.
Aside from assessing the efficiency of their products, we also
score companies according to how much renewable energy they use and
the level of their commitment to significantly reducing
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top scorers on energy-efficiency of individual products are
Apple, Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Samsung, with &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-toshiba-ra-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; providing a further example of a
company that is improving its climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greener Electronics: Responsibly recycled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to see an end to the stories of unprotected child
labourers scavenging mountains of cast-off gadgets created by
society's gizmo-loving ways. The latest place where we have
discovered high-tech toxic trash causing horrendous pollution is in
Ghana. Our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/poisoning-the-poor-electonic/" target="_blank"&gt;recent investigation into e-waste dumping in
Ghana&lt;/a&gt; revealed major companies' products being torn apart in
almost mediaeval conditions, exposing people to alarming levels of
toxic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the company with the
worst position on e-waste and recycling. It ranks 12th with 4.3
points, retaining its penalty point for negative lobbying on
Individual Producer Responsibility in the EU. Put simply, this
means that companies like Philips believe that the costs for
responsible recycling of their obsolete and end-of-life products
should be met by governments and consumers (and that means
you!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philips has a &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/08/regressive_tv_brand_lobbying_c.html" target="_blank"&gt;bad history of holding this negative stance on
recycling&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Sharp and Sanyo, Philips was a member
of the Electronic Manufacturers' Coalition for Responsible
Recycling, a coalition of TV producers in the US that lobbied
against producer responsibility for financing e-waste recycling and
instead putting this responsibility - and expense - on governments
and the buyers of its products (that means you!). Many companies
left this coalition after being either penalised or threatened with
a penalty in earlier editions of our Greener Electronics Guide, and
the coalition was finally dissolved in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Switching to Green Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more companies now scoring higher than 5 out of 10 - the
halfway mark in the ranking - a company that rises to the challenge
of phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing the recycling rate of
e-waste, using recycled materials in new products and reducing its
impact on climate change could soon find itself &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/searching-for-green-electronics/" target="_blank"&gt;winning the race&lt;/a&gt; to produce the world's first
truly green electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Get email updates about the greening of the electronics industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept any donations from corporations or governments.

	Unilever has shown that beauty isn’t just skin deep. Following our campaign and thanks to your support, the company has taken the bold step to support our call for a moratorium on cutting down trees in Indonesia for palm oil plantations.

Sometimes it takes a lot longer to make acompany, corporation or government see the error of its ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;But our work is not yet done! Palm oil isused for a wide range of products – from toothpaste to margarine, and fromwashing powders to soaps. Following our meeting with Unilever last week,agreements on what needs to happen next are now taking shape. Even thoughUnilever is the biggest buyer of palm oil, it represents only three percent of palmoil purchasers. The moratorium will need support from other companies if wewant to see real change in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unilever has agreed to rise to thechallenge and lead the way, building a coalition of allies to put pressure on palmoil suppliers in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;to agree to the moratorium. This includes lobbying all the major players in theindustry, including Kraft, Nestlé, Cadburys, Cargill and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Over the coming months, we’ll be meetingwith companies and urging them to join Unilever in supporting the moratoriumand stopping deforestation and the release of greenhouse gases that fuel climatechange. This coalition of influential players in the palm oil industry –together with the support of palm oil suppliers and the Indonesian government -is key to getting the moratorium in place as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There's still a long way to go to ensure that
the climate is protected from further deforestation, that the
bulldozers leave the rainforest and that orang-utans are saved from
extinction in the wild. We'll be keeping you updated - and we'll be
letting you know if we need your help again to put pressure on any
company that may need a bit of an incentive to support the
moratorium!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The GM food industry suffered another serious setback today as European Commissioners overturned the verdict of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), who had given assurances that three new types of GM crops were safe. For the first time, Europe's most senior lawmakers are publicly doubting the safety of GM crops.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            GMO maize - ringing alarm bells for European Commissioners
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;The EFSA had previouslygiven the green light for a new type of GM potato and two types of GM maize tobe grown. However, when &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt;'s leaders beganto delve into the data on safety of these crops alarm bells rang.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Leading experts from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO), the Institut Pasteur and the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMEA) have already raised concerns about the impact of Germanchemical giant BASF's GM potato on human health. The crop could result in people andanimals developing resistance to certain types of antibiotics which are used totreat diseases. The data on the two types of GM maize wasn't much better.Scientists believe that they could harm wildlife such as butterflies and otherinsects. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;And if this mounting bodyof evidence wasn't enough to make &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt;'sCommissioners sit up and think again, then the 130,000 email messages fromGreenpeace supporters certainly helped them to do so. &lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Since last autumn, when Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas firststood up to the biotech industry, tens of thousands of environmentalistshave kept the heat on the European Commission about thisissue. We posted comments on Commission blogs, we wrote them emails, we sentthem postcards and petitions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Greenpeace International'sGeert Ritsema certainly thinks that the decision is another nail in the coffinfor the GM food industry. On hearing of the Commission's decision,Ritsema said, "that policy makers at the very highest levels are nowquestioning the safety of GM crops is very significant". &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;"The fact that the Commission has ordered a second investigation also raiseshuge questions over the EFSA’s ability to do its job properly. How can wetrust it to get it right on other crops if it has got it so badly wrongthis time?"  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Of course,scientific opinion means little when the giants of the GM industry areusing every trick in the book to make sure that the crops are given the goahead. It's no secret that the industry has been trying to intimidate &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/place&gt; into giving the go ahead by threatening to launcha law suit against the Commission if it didn't agree.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Commission should be given a pat on the back for not caving intoindustry pressure. Having said that, why is the Commission asking the EFSA to look again at the crops when it has shown itself completelyincapable of doing so the first time round?  There is no escaping thefacts. The impact on the environment and on human health of GM crops thatproduce their own insecticides is completely unknown. The Commissionshould have recognised this and rejected the new crops outright. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	Stake outs, testimony from informers, hidden cameras and tailing trucks full of stolen goods - it reads like a Hollywood movie, but it was an every day experience for Greenpeace activists in Japan, who have spent four months cracking open a major conspiracy of corruption at the heart of Japan's government-backed, sham scientific whaling operation.

&lt;b&gt;Latest updates and background on the whale meat
scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We displayed a cardboard box filled with the best cuts of whale
meat, smuggled ashore by the crew of the Japanese whaling factory
ship, Nisshin Maru, for illegal trade and personal gain, at the
Japanese taxpayer's expense. The box, along with videotaped
testimony and other evidence, suggest widespread embezzlement of
whale meat has been occuring for decades under the noses of the
public officials who run the whaling programme, and are allowing it
to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Box green"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Update, May 20th: You did it! &lt;/span&gt;More than 40,000 of
you wrote to the Japanese government to demand an investigation,
and today the Tokyo district Public Prosecutor has confirmed that
there will one. We will be cooperating in every way possible to
ensure that it is a full investigation, to the highest levels and
not simply the scapegoating of a few individual crew members. While
the investigation is underway, we're demanding that the government
immediately suspend any whaling permits, as well as stop
thetax-payers' subsidy to the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whale Bureaucrats aware of theft from taxpayers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our activists delivered the evidence, including the whale meat,
to the Public Prosecutor's office in Tokyo, calling on it to make a
full public enquiry into how deep the corruption runs with the
whaling programme. We're also calling for an end to the USD$4.7
million taxpayer subsidies for the programme, and for the license
of the company operating the whale hunt, Kyodo Senpaku, to be
withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhlOxfAljAo"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four-month Greenpeace investigation employed undercover
tactics to reveal dramatic evidence of an embezzlement ring
involving crewmembers on board the Nisshin Maru. Informers who
spoke to the activists claim that senior crew and officials from
Kyodo Senpaku turned a blind eye to the whale meat theft, allowing
it to continue for decades. One informer associated with Kyodo
Senpaku told Greenpeace that officials from the Institute of
Cetacean Research (ICR) - the agency that carries out the so-called
"scientific research" work on board the Nisshin Maru - are most
likely aware of the thefts as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The information we have gathered indicates that the scale of
the scandal is so great, it would be impossible for the ship's
operating company, Kyodo Senpaku, not to know," said Junichi Sato,
Greenpeace Japan whales campaign coordinator. "Kyodo Senpaku is
turning their back on large scale corruption and theft of
taxpayers' money. What we need to know now, through a full public
enquiry, is who else is profiting from the whaling programme? Who
else has allowed this fraud to continue?" Sato added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from information given by former and current Kyodo
Senpaku employees, the Greenpeace investigators secretly documented
the offloading of smuggled whale meat into a special truck, while
Kyodo Senpaku officials and crew members stood by, following the
Nisshin Maru's return earlier this year, on April 15th. Greenpeace
then tracked the consignment from the ship to a depot in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25179/consignment-sheet-detailing-i.jpg" alt="Consignment Label" vspace="4" width="430" border="0" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;Consignment sheet detailing, in Japanese,
the contents of a crewmembers' personal box offloaded from the
whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, containing 23.5 kilograms of
stolen whale meat.  The sheet lists the contents of the box as
"cardboard."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The house that stolen whale meat built&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of four boxes destined for the same private address was then
intercepted, to verify the contents and establish the fraud. The
consignment notes claimed the box contained "cardboard" - but in
reality held 23.5kg of salted 'prime' whale meat, worth up to
US$3,000, hidden beneath overalls. One informer told Greeneace that
dozens of crew take as many as 20 of these boxes each, and said he
overheard one crewmember claim  to have built a house from the
proceeds in stolen whale bacon alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To track down the final destination of this meat, activists
visited pubs and restaurants in a number of different locations
around Japan where they requested "special" meat and filmed the
responses using hidden cameras. Traders and restaurant owners
confirmed that they were expecting the imminent delivery of whale
meat from this year's hunt, despite the fact that the Japanese
Fisheries Agency and the Institute of Cetacean Research do not
release the whale meat for sale before the end of June, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Japanese government-backed scientific whaling
programme, which takes place in the internationally-recognised
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, has been continually mired in
controversy, lies and scandal, bringing Japan into international
disrepute. This latest scandal begs the question of just who
profits from a whaling programme which generates no useful science,
and is commercially unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scandals high and low: how high does this one go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the scandal of stolen whalemeat is the most shocking, it's
not the only revelation to come from this investigation. Further
allegations from our informants that require investigation
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing tonnes of whale meat overboard daily because they did
not have processing capacity for the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cancerous tumours being found and cut out of whales and the
remaining meat processed for public sale&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Targeted hunts to ensure maximum catch, not random "sampling"
as required by the research permits&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Harsh working conditions because of the increased workload from
the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

dossier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Japanese society already bristling from a litany of public
scandals involving &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jan/18/greenbusiness.recycling"&gt;
recycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071029a7.html"&gt;food
labelling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2017410.ece"&gt;
pensions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1625862,00.html"&gt;
bid-rigging for public works&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST15100620071115"&gt;
bribes for defence contracts,&lt;/a&gt; the whaling industry now joins
the ranks of the dishonoured, as well as earning the scepticism of
an increasingly dubious business community, with business magazine
&lt;i&gt;Shukan Toyo Keizai&lt;/i&gt; suggesting that "&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/02/shukan_toyo_keizai_on_whaling.html"&gt;
the stance of whaling hardliners could also be a vent for
narrow-minded nationalism&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt; newspaper reported
that the whalers &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
were struggling to pay back $1 billion Yen&lt;/a&gt; in borrowed public
funds. With a massive 4,000 tonne stockpile of unconsumed whalemeat
and &lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt; reports of &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
consumer disinterest in "bloody drippings"&lt;/a&gt;, the whalers seem to
be onto a sure loser. To make matters worse, the annual increase in
targeted Southern Ocean whales means that supply is already
outstripping demand, a situation "unthinkable for an ordinary
business entity" according to the accountant of a major audit
corporation quoted by the &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is
funded by the Japanese taxpayers and they have a right to know who
is profiting from their money," commented Sato. "The Japanese
whaling programme has already been shamed internationally for its
lack of scientific credibility, embarrassed by the generation of
vast stockpile of whale meat few want to eat and is now embroiled
in a scandal at home for being corrupt. It is time for the whaling
programme to be stopped and public money spent on something more
honourable." Sato concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/japan-investigate-the-stolen/"&gt;Help us create an outcry for a full investigation and demand the permits of the whalers be revoked.  Write a letter to the Japanese Prime minister. It will only take a minute. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/supportus"&gt;How can Greenpeace continue to bite the hands of governments and corporations? We don't let them feed us, that's how.  But that means we rely on small donations from people like you to keep our investigators undercover, our ships at sea, and our campaigns effective. Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Just a few days into our three-month “Defending Our Mediterranean” tour, and already the Arctic Sunrise has come face-to-face with pirates. In the early hours of the morning, we confiscated almost two kilometres of illegal driftnet, containing dead, undersized bluefin tuna - and a small sea turtle.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mediterranean Sea, Arctic Sunrise - crew of the Arctic Sunrise confiscate a length of illegal driftnet from the Italian fishing vessel Diomede II.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Moving through Greek Ionian waters towards &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;state w:st="on"&gt;Sicily&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/place&gt;, the ArcticSunrise passed a small drifting boat. Its crew had tried to stop their boatfrom being identified by covering its name and registration number; notsomething you’d think of doing unless you were obviously up to no good!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Fortunately for us, we never go anywherewithout a photographer with a camera and a high-poweredtelescopic lens! Confirming that it was the Italian fishing vessel &lt;i&gt;Diomede II&lt;/i&gt;, we checked the EU’s databaseof fishing vessels; it is licensed only to fish within 15 miles (approximately 24 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;kilometres) of theSicilian coast, and then only with longline or anchored nets. The &lt;i&gt;Diomede II &lt;/i&gt;was some 50 kilometresfrom the coast – and, with the seabed being 1500 metres down, we knew theycouldn’t be using anchored nets and could only be fishing with driftnets. So,the Arctic Sunrise’s crew set to work - and managed to haul in almost twokilometres of the driftnet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CqggoesNeCM&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Known as “walls of death”, driftnetscatch everything that crosses their path, including protectedspecies such as whales, dolphins and turtles. They’ve been banned for years bythe United Nations, the European Union, the International Conservation ofAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the General Fisheries Commission for the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt;. Of course, for bans to be effective they have to be enforced. Despite the European Commissionproposing laws to blacklist fishing vessels involved in illegal practices, &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/country-region&gt; and other &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;placename w:st="on"&gt;Member&lt;/placename&gt; &lt;placetype w:st="on"&gt;States&lt;/placetype&gt;&lt;/place&gt;are trying to water these down. Although the authorities confiscate hundreds ofkilometres of illegal driftnet every year, fleets from &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Italy&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt; and otherMediterranean countries are still fishing illegally.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;And the problem isn’t restricted to the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt;. At the same time as the crew of the ArcticSunrise are busy &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/defending-our-mediterranean-to/"&gt;Defending Our Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, on the other side of the worldthe crew of the Esperanza are busy &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;Defending Our Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve been bearing witness and taking action against purse seine and longlinevessels. They’ve been doing their own bit of turtle rescuing, as well asfreeing lots of other marine life from inevitable death on the longlines. Andthey’re also finding that international laws are being regularly floutedbecause little is being done to enforce them.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;That’s why we’re calling for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;globalnetwork of marine reserves&lt;/a&gt;, covering 40 percent of our seas and oceans,including the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/place&gt; and the Pacific:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves will close off high seas    areas currently used as loopholes by pirate fishers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves are vital to ensure that    fish stocks recover;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves are essential to ensure that the fishing industry has a sustainable future;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Marine reserves will also protect our seas  and oceans from the ravages of climate change and protect ocean life from   habitat collapse and destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;We’ve followedthe &lt;i&gt;Diomede II &lt;/i&gt;back home to itsharbour in &lt;state w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Sicily&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/state&gt;, where it is being met by the coastguard – we’ve asked for the driftnets still onboard to be confiscated. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Quite some homecoming for the pirates (though probably not the sort they were hoping for!). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;And,in the meantime, while it was too late to do anything for the tuna trapped in the driftnet we confiscated, the baby turtle managed to make it out alive! So we’re happy to say that, somewhere in the &lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Mediterranean,&lt;/place&gt;there’s at least one baby turtle who’s had the chance to head back home, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Updated, 8 May 2008:&lt;/b&gt; We're happy to
report that the coastguard has confiscated the &lt;i&gt;Diomede II&lt;/i&gt;'s
driftnets! It was a long day for the crew of the Arctic Sunrise -
and they'll keep on going; fishing out the Pirates of the
Mediterranean and denouncing, exposing and stopping illegal
fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If you want other baby turtles to have the chance to escape the driftnets and make it home, we need your help! And, if we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today. Add your name to the call to protect the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept money from governments or corporations -- and our financial independence is what allows us to pressure both.

	As the seventh annual Carbon Capture &amp; Sequestration conference gets underway in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Greenpeace has launched 'False Hope' - a report critically examining the status and promise of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The conclusion is that, despite what the coal and power industries claim, CCS will not prevent more than a whiff of global warming pollution from reaching the atmosphere in the next few decades.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Coal-fired power station smokestacks. Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and the largest single contributor to climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCS aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) emissions from power station
smokestacks and dump it underground. Although it's being described
as a "silver bullet" solution in combating the climate crisis, CCS
has yet to be used on any large-scale coal-fired power plant
anywhere in the world. And, as &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/false-hope/"&gt;
'&lt;i&gt;False Hope&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;/a&gt; reveals, there are huge unknowns regarding
feasibility, cost, environmental implications and liability which
have not been thought through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in greenhouse gas emissions needs to be halted in
the next decade and emissions then need to be cut significantly.
CCS will not be ready in time. Ironically, the suggestion that the
technology may be made to work some time in the future is being
used to justify building new coal-fired power plants without any
form of carbon 'capture'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes most sense is not building coal-fired power plants in
the first place. Carbon is already 'stored' safely underground: we
call it coal. Let's leave it there. Adapting an old phrase, "when
you find yourself in a (climate) hole, the first thing is to stop
digging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a perverse situation where policymakers who claim to
recognise the urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions are
considering bankrolling the development of an unproven technology
over funding proven pollution-free renewable energy sources and
energy efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCS is unproven, risky and expensive and investing in it
threatens to undermine the range of clean energy solutions which
are available right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS not ready in time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate experts say the worst impacts of climate change can be
averted by levelling off global warming pollution by 2015 and
turning down the burner after that. But the earliest that CCS will
be ready is 2030. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change is even less optimistic. The IPCC doesn't
see CCS being commercially viable until even later - around
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS wastes energy and resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capturing and storing carbon dioxide would be a major energy
consumer, gobbling up anything from 10 to 40% of a power plant's
electricity output. So more coal needs to be mined, transported,
and burned for a power station to generate the same amount of
energy as it would without CCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demands for cooling water also increase dramatically. Power
stations with capture technology could require 90% more freshwater
than those without. CCS is expected to erase gains in power plant
energy efficiency made over the past 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one-third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Storing carbon underground is risky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is uncertain whether there is sufficient suitable space
underground to bury enough carbon to have any meaningful climate
impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has no experience of safely storing anything forever.
But locking up carbon dioxide underground in perpetuity is exactly
what would need to be accomplished with CCS. A leakage rate of just
1% could potentially undermine any climate benefit. Tests have
thrown up unexpected results, such CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; disintegrating storage
materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS is expensive and undermines real solutions to climate
change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCS could well mean electricity price rises of between 21 and
91%. Clean energy sources, such as wind power, provide electricity
much more cheaply than coal-fired plants fitted with CCS will ever
be able to. The funding to get CCS off the ground - including
substantial sums of taxpayer's money - comes at the expense of real
solutions. In countries it has been pursued, CCS has taken up an
increasing share of energy research and development budgets whereas
funding for renewable technologies and energy efficiency has
stagnated or declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, for example, the Department of Energy has asked for
the CCS programme budget to be raised to US $623.6 million. At the
same time, it is scaling back renewable energy research to US
$146.2 million. Worse still, legislation introduced on Capitol Hill
would allocate a whopping US $424 billion to a dedicated fund for
CCS. Australia, meanwhile, has three research centres devoted to
fossil fuels, including one committed to CCS, but none for
renewable energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CCS and liability: risky business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale CCS applications pose significant and new liability
risks, including negative impacts on human health, damage to
ecosystems, groundwater contamination such as the pollution of
drinking water and increased greenhouse gas emissions from
leakage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, energy interests want a free ride by being relieved of
liability in return for investing in CCS. Some demand they be
relieved of ownership of CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; at
the power plant gates, or that they remain liable for CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; dumped underground for a mere ten
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs of any mishaps would have to be covered from the
public purse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of support offered to the recently collapsed
FutureGen project in the US gives some inkling of the real costs of
CCS. FutureGen was the Bush Administration's flagship CCS project.
It not only received unprecedented public funds (to the tune of US
$1.3 bn) but was protected from financial and legal liability in
the event of an unanticipated release of carbon, indemnified from
lawsuits and even had its insurance premiums paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The alternative to CCS: renewables and energy efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy and energy saving have proven track records in
meeting energy needs safely, cleanly, predictably and
cost-effectively. The world has sufficient technically accessible
renewable energy to meet global energy needs six times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the risky and expensive option of CCS which is
still on the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details of how clean energy and energy efficiency can cut
almost halve global CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
emissions  by 2050 are contained in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt;

	It's been a busy morning for Greenpeace activists across Europe, many of whom have been dressing up as orang-utans to draw attention to Unilever's "monkey business". Today, we're launching the next stage in our campaign to protect the rainforests of Indonesia from the expansion of the palm oil industry.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Orang-utan suited activists scale a Unilever plant to protest Unilever's use of palm oil from Indonesian forests. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that Unilever, maker of Dove and many other
well-known brands, is buying palm oil from companies that are
destroying valuable rainforest and peatland areas; bad news not
only for the millions of people who depend on these for their way
of life and endangered species such as the orang-utan, but also for
the global climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE (1 May 2008):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style="color: #808080; font-size: 80%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good news!
Unilever (Dove's parent company) is feeling the heat from customers
like you, and has made a positive statement. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/unilever-palm-oil080501/"&gt;
Read about it here.&lt;/a&gt; We'llmeet with them soon to talk about the
details. For now, we need moresignatures to &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/"&gt;
this open letter&lt;/a&gt; and keep spreading the word.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/orang-utans-swing-into-action-to-stop-dove-destroying-rainforests-for-palm-oil-20080421"&gt;
In the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, at the Unilever factory at Port
Sunlight, near Liverpool, sixty Greenpeace activists occupied the
production lines, while in London employees at Unilever's HQ were
greeted on their way to work by screeching mating calls and
orang-utans clambering all over the building. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/news/kettingzaaginunilever"&gt;At
Unilever's Rotterdam HQ, in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, six activists
scaled the waterfront building and hung a banner reading,
"Unilever, Don't Destroy the Forests". In Rome, another ten
orang-utans stopped &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-italy/news/dove-borneo"&gt;Unilever
employees entering their Italian HQ&lt;/a&gt;. Jumping out of a huge box
marked, "Stop Dove from Destroying Rainforests," the orang-utans
handed out flyers outlining the palm oil situation and demanding a
moratium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Unilever? For a start, Unilever is one of the largest users
of palm oil in the world, funnelling up to 1 in every 20 litres
produced from Indonesia into some of its many products. This means
Unilever has a huge influence on the way palm oil is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, as chair of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO), Unilever has even more clout. The RSPO is a group of
retailers, manufacturers and suppliers whose aim is to create
standards for the production of sustainable palm oil. As things
stand, however, it's little more than a greenwashing operation, as
card-carrying members of the RSPO continue to be involved in the
destruction of Indonesia's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following its creation in 2002, the RSPO set up a certification
scheme, but six years later not a drop of certified oil is yet
available. Even when certified palm oil does become available later
this year, there's nothing to prevent it being blended with
non-certified palm oil. This will make it impossible for RSPO
members to guarantee that their palm oil does not come from
recently deforested areas. All this was documented in our '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/palm-oil-cooking-the-climate/"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Cooking the Climate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;' report, produced last November, in
which Unilever featured prominently. Since then, we've collected
fresh evidence of Unilever's role in deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's actions coincide with the release of our new report, '&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/how-unilever-palm-oil-supplier/"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How Unilever's suppliers are Burning Up Borneo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'. The
report details how some of Unilever's key palm oil suppliers -
Sinar Mas, Wilmar, Sime Darby and IOI among them - are devastating
forest and peatland areas in Central Kalimantan. Not only are
millions of people who live in or rely on the forests for their
survival being put at risk, but as these areas are destroyed many
endangered species are at even greater risk of extinction,
including Sumatran tigers, Javan rhinoceroses and orang-utans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also devastating consequences for the climate. As the
forests and tropical peatlands of Indonesia are destroyed and
converted into oil palm plantations, huge volumes of greenhouse
gases are released, accelerating climate change. Indonesia is the
third largest emitter of these gases in the world, in large part
due to the destruction of its forests at the hands of the palm oil
industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not great going for a company that paints itself green
and responsible: take a look at Unilever's website, where it makes
a big deal of its efforts to be both environmentally and socially
responsible. As our report shows, when it comes to palm oil the
reality is very different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want Unilever to clean up its act, not just with the palm oil
it uses in Dove but in all its products. To start the ball rolling,
we've devised a three-point action plan for Unilever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support an immediate moratorium on the destruction of
rainforest and peatland areas in Indonesia to grow palm oil;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;stop trading with palm oil suppliers who are involved in this
destruction; and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;pressure the RSPO to also support a moratorium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Talk to Dove&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/asia-pacific/dove-palmoil-action/"&gt;Unilever, the maker of Dove beauty products, is buying palm oil from suppliers who destroy Indonesia's rainforests. We've got the proof. Unilever is causing forest destruction, species extinction and climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept corporate donations. That gives us the freedom to bite the hand of any government or business. It also makes us entirely dependent on people like you to keep us going. Please help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	He may be the most famous humpback whale in the world but Mister Splashy Pants has lots of less famous friends too, all of them named by our supporters around the world.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Humpback whale swims past the Cook Island whale research boat, enjoying the warm water and the protected reefs of Rarotonga (Cook Islands). 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/great-whale-trail/"&gt;
The Great Whale Trail&lt;/a&gt; (GWT), we collaborated with scientists
working on humpback whales in the South Pacific. With financial
support from Greenpeace, humpback whales were tagged by the &lt;a href="http://www.whaleresearch.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Cook Islands
Center for Cetacean Research and Conservation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.operationcetaces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Opération
Cétacés&lt;/a&gt; (New Caledonia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the scientists encouragement, we asked our supporters to
help name the tagged whales. The most famous of them is undoubtedly
&lt;b&gt;Mister Splashy Pants&lt;/b&gt;, who came out on top of our online
whale name poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other winners from the poll that are now the proud names of
humpbacks in the South Pacific are, &lt;b&gt;Humphrey&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Aiko&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;Libertad&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Mira&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kaimana&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Aurora&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;Shanti&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Amal&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Manami&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our supporters in Japan also named a couple of whales
with composer &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Ryuichisakamoto-101007"&gt;
Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt; naming a whale &lt;b&gt;Neo&lt;/b&gt; after his son and
Japanese rock guitarist &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/sugizo/"&gt;Sugizo&lt;/a&gt;
naming a whale &lt;b&gt;Lyra&lt;/b&gt; after being inspired to protect the
environment after the birth of his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more whale was named after a school in the Cook Islands
after the children of the school had tried to save a stranded whale
just months before the humpbacks were tagged. The whale was not a
humpback whale but a &lt;a href="http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/CuviersWhale.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cuviers beaked whale&lt;/a&gt; which had stranded itself
on the beach opposite the Ngatangiia school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whale died shortly after it was discovered but became the
subject of an en masse lesson for the kids who watched over it all
day in utter amazement. The children were so moved by the
experience that they named the whale Kakera, meaning 'the rising
sun', which is also the name of the land that the school is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honour of the whale who died and the children who tried to
save it, there is now a humpback whale swimming around in the South
Pacific named &lt;b&gt;Kakera&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another whale was named by the readers of the Daily Telegraph,
anAustralian newspaper. The name they choose was &lt;b&gt;Iluka&lt;/b&gt;, an
AustralianAboriginal word meaning 'near the sea'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 5 whales left to name we turned to our most ardent
supporters, the whale defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Wu from Hong Kong named a whale &lt;b&gt;Siu King&lt;/b&gt; meaning
'smiling whale' in Cantonese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenni Barrett from Ireland named a whale &lt;b&gt;SIDD&lt;/b&gt; after the
first name initials of the three Irish crew members onboard the
Esperanza (&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ara Holden, &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ave Walsh and &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ave
McEvitt ) and one honorary Irish citizen (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;rene Berg - from
Sweden).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitney from USA named a whale &lt;b&gt;Maggie Mae&lt;/b&gt; partly after
her grandmother, aged 83, who is called Margaret (sometimes Maggie)
and partly after the Rod Stewart song of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varga Åskvigg from Sweden named a whale &lt;b&gt;Varuna&lt;/b&gt; after the
Vedic (Hindu) sea God, the protector of the sea and sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloé Banville from Canada named a whale &lt;b&gt;Anaïs&lt;/b&gt; which
means grace in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to all the people who participated in The Great
Whale Trail. With your help, we are another step closer to ending
whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/use-a-canon-to-shoot-whales/"&gt;Canon is famous for supporting wildlife initiatives dedicated to protecting endangered species. So why won't they condemn the killing of whales for unnecessary research?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/donate"&gt;To maintain our independence, Greenpeace doesn't accept corporate donations. That gives us the freedom to bite the hand of any government or business. It also makes us entirely dependent on people like you to keep us going. Please help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Mediterranean Sea is a global treasure. Rich seagrass meadows and rocky reefs dominate its coastal zone while an awe-inspiring array of underwater mountains (seamounts), cold seeps and trenches are found on its seabed.

            Coris julis over a Zostera seagrass bed near Kas, Greece.The Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise is in the Mediterranean for a three-month ship tour taking action on the threats to the sea and calling for a network of large-scale marine reserves to protect the health and productivity of the Mediterranean Sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean represents less than 1 percent of the world's
oceans yet contains some 10,000 species - that's around 9 percent
of the world's marine biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over-fishing and destructive fishing, including continued
illegal use of driftnets, pollution, and rampant coastal
development are steadily eroding this treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Defending our Mediterranean"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, for the third year in a row, is tackling these
threats head-on. With our ship the Arctic Sunrise we are conducting
a 3 month "Defending our Mediterranean" tour. The expedition will
travel across the Mediterranean region exposing and taking action
on destructive activities, documenting areas in need of protection,
and calling for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition is part of our call for a network of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/" target="_blank"&gt;marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; across the Mediterranean, in
both international waters and in coastal regions. Marine reserves -
national parks at sea - are areas where no destructive activities
are allowed, they provide a sanctuary for marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message is simple. "If we want fish tomorrow; we need marine
reserves today".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Threats facing the Mediterranean Sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Bluefin tuna is
on the brink of collapse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majestic bluefin tuna is famous as a symbol of the
Mediterranean. This incredible fish can accelerate faster than a
Porsche and can swim as fast as 43 miles (almost 70 kilometres) per
hour. It is one of the top predators of the Mediterranean
food-chain; crucial to the delicate ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mediterranean bluefin are in serious trouble - "time and
tuna are running out." In 1999, we recorded how Mediterranean
bluefin stocks had declined by 80 percent, and it's getting worse.
Rampant over-fishing and pirate fishing are pushing this precious
species to the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is out of control,
and must be closed immediately to allow the population to recover.
Proper management must be put in place, including marine reserves
to protect tuna breeding areas, if the fishery is ever to become
sustainable again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Driftnets - "walls
of death"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driftnets, known as "walls of death" are primarily used to catch
dwindling stocks of swordfish, but are also responsible for
regularly trapping and killing whales, dolphins and turtles that
happen to cross their path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driftnets have been banned for years by the United Nations, the
European Union, the International Commission for Conservation of
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the General Fisheries Commission for the
Mediterranean, (GFCM). In other words, they are most definitely
illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite millions of euros being spent on decommissioning
driftnets, they are still widely used in the Mediterranean.
Hundreds of thousands of kilometres of these illegal nets are loose
in the waters, indiscriminately killing marine life. In 2006,
Greenpeace confronted and confiscated driftnets from Italian
vessels, including one that had received €28,000 in grants to
change its fishing gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Coastal
development&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seagrass beds are common to shallow seas around much of the
Mediterranean. They are important nursery areas, and help protect
the seabed. They provide a special habitat for small animals and
plants. But rampant development of coastlines for hotels, holiday
homes, marinas and ports is destroying seagrass beds. In the worst
areas they have disappeared altogether; leading to serious loss of
biodiversity and habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2006 Greenpeace Spain recorded that some 1.5
million dwellings and 293 golf courses had been built along 8000
kilometres of Spanish coastline. 116 leisure ports were either
constructed or added to; 102 cases of urban development corruption
were uncovered. The unplanned and reckless nature of this urban
development along the coastline is causing severe erosion and
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"&gt;Pollution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of tonnes of toxic waste are pumped directly into the
Mediterranean Sea every year. Shipping, urban and agricultural
pollution and tourism are aggravating the crisis. Mercury, cadmium,
zinc and lead in sediments are found at "hot-spots", all too often
located in coastal zones exposed to pollution.  These substances
can travel thousands of kilometres, posing irreversible risks to
human health and marine life across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately one third of the world's total merchant shipping
crosses the Mediterranean each year. Some 370 million tonnes of oil
are transported annually across this busy Sea- that's more than 20%
of the world total.On average 10 oil spills a year happen in the
Mediterranean. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Expedition is calling for Marine
Reserves  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Defending our Mediterranean" will confront these threats, and
more. We are calling for a network of marine reserves to cover
forty percent of the Sea. Large scale reserves to protect
international waters, and a network of smaller reserves to protect
coastal areas and allow fishing grounds to recover and flourish
again. A network of marine reserves for the Mediterranean Sea will
represent a shift in the balance of human impacts, from damage and
harm to protection and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for marine reserves in the Mediterranean is part of
Greenpeace's call for a global network of properly enforced marine
reserves to cover forty percent of the world's oceans. The
Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza is currently in the Pacific
confronting overfishing and calling for the creation of marine
reserves in the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
Pacific Commons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today. Add your name to the call to protect the world's oceans. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Brussels Seafood Expo - Business Closed! </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/brussels-seafood-expo-230408/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace shuts down tuna trading &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	"Ladies and Gentlemen your attention please, the Dongwon, Mitsubishi, Moon Marine, Azzopardi and Ricardo Fuentes stalls are now closed." That was one message being relayed over the public address sound system at the Brussels Seafood Expo today, as Greenpeace closed down the stands of five  tuna suppliers - including the world's largest, Mitsibushi.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-present-message-dire.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/activists-present-message-dire.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists present message directly at an international seafood fair - "Time and Tuna are running out".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;80 activists from 15 countries covered the stands with fishing
nets, chained themselves to the stands and put up banners in 13
languages saying; 'Time and Tuna are running out'. They also
stenciled the very simple "business closed" across many stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://5am.org/fish/eng.mp3" class="act" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the messages we broadcast at the Expo.
(mp3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no trading at all going on at the Ricardo
Fuentes stand, where 30 people locked on, but trading across the
fair was stopped as people flocked to the stand to see what was
going on. Outside we relayed the same message to people coming into
the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;World's largest seafood trading event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://greenpeace.rack66.com/images/seafood/slideshow.html" style="border: medium none ; width: 100%; height: 350px"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels Seafood Expo is the world's largest seafood trading
event. If you want to see the world's remaining fish stocks
literally served up on a plate, this is the place to come. 1,600
companies from 80 countries are trading their goods, alternatively
known as global marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got our message out today directly to fish suppliers that
unless fisheries go sustainable then neither those who trade in
fish, nor our fish stocks, have a future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There simply aren't enough fish left in the sea to sustain the
world's voracious appetite. The world's oceans are in crisis. Some
two-thirds of fish stocks are either fully exploited or overfished.
Many stocks, such as Mediterranean bluefin tuna and North Sea cod
are on the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing methods such as bottom trawling, purse seining,
longlining, and industrial methods which can catch as much fish in
two days as the fishers of small Pacific Island countries can catch
in a year, are all threatening the sustainability and habitats of
the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the seafood on display at the Expo is either endangered
or has been fished using destructive techniques. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending overfishing and destructive fishing is not only crucial
to saving our marine environment, it is vital to the very survival
of the fishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we told traders today - going sustainable is the only way to
ensure their business has a future. It's not rocket science. In
fact it's really really simple; if you take more fish out of our
oceans than can be replenished - fish stocks will collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Greenpeace has stopped trading of some of the most endangered
species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have stopped business at Mitsubishi - the word's largest tuna
trader, and at Ricardo Fuentes, who not only dominate the Med's
bluefin tuna fishery but are also the biggest company involved in
bluefin tuna ranching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/time-s-running-out-for-tuna-200408/"&gt;
&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25189/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3.jpg" alt="Tuna Overkill" border="0" height="298" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dongwon is active in the Pacific - where our ship the Esperanza
is &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/time-s-running-out-for-tuna-200408/"&gt;
currently confronting overfishing and pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and
calling for the creation of marine reserves to protect the Pacific
Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Consumers want sustainable fish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80 percent of European consumers consider the environmental
impacts of seafood as important to their purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for seafood suppliers and retailers to
ensure that they only source or buy seafood that has come from
sustainable sources, and is not fished in destructive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our markets work across Europe has led to many supermarkets
adopting sustainable procurement policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers should not need to ask if the fish they want to buy is
stolen or overfished - retailers need to ensure that no fish that
reaches their shelves is stolen, or depleting the planet's
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for 40 percent of the world's oceans to be
turned into marine reserves - national parks at sea. Marine
reserves are areas closed to all extractive uses, including fishing
and mining. In ocean areas that have already been protected,
threatened species are returning and there is an overall increase
in their variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating marine reserves will do a lot to make sustainable
fishing goals achievable - and ultimately protect the future of the
fishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Bush's lame duck climate 'plan'</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bush-lame-duck-mem-climate-plan170408/</url><text>
	President Bush has tried again to make the world believe that he will rectify his shameful record of ignoring, denying and fuelling climate change. He's announced that by 2025, the US will stop increasing its emissions. Yes, for another 15 years the country that has spewed more emissions into the atmosphere than any other country on Earth will continue to emit more and more. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/1/monumental-failure.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A clear message to US President George Bush projected on the Washington Monument.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush must have missed the reports by the Noble Prize winning
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The IPCC
unequivocally says that global emissions need to peak within the
next 10 years at the latest. Ten years, not 17!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush's plan for after 2025 is also lamentable. Bush says, the US
may cut emissions, if coal can be made clean, nuclear power is safe
- and pigs can be genetically engineered to fly. This is a woefully
inadequate response by an administration that has obstructed global
efforts to tackle climate change at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush arrived as an oil man from Texas at the White House in
2001. He leaves as an oil man from Texas in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush made his speech on the occasion of the &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bush-s-major-emitters-meeting/"&gt;
Major Emitters Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (MEM)  currently underway in Paris. This
US-driven initiative, launched last year, brings together 16
countries that collectively emit over 80 percent of global
emissions to discuss climate change. But the MEM, like Bush's
speech, is nothing but an attempt by the Bush administration to
deflect attention from its shameful record on tackling climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding emission targets for industrialised countries are the
basis of any meaningful global agreement to fight climate change.
France said as much at the last climate summit in Bali last
December. Climate talks that don't result in binding targets for
industrialised countries are meaningless, France said. Which begs
the question - why is French President Sarkozy hosting this useless
talking shop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCain, Obama and Clinton all support binding emission
reductions for the whole US economy. That is good news, because
Bush is a 'lame duck' and will be out of office when the next
global climate agreement will be made in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries attending the MEM, must listen to Noble Peace Prize
Laureate, Desmond Tutu. In a statement supporting Greenpeace's
position on the MEM he reminds rich world leaders of their
responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many rich world leaders have not, so far, responded to the
climate crisis with the urgency required. Cushioned and cosseted,
they have had the luxury of closing their minds to the real impact
of what is happening in the fragile and precious atmosphere that
surrounds the planet we live on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wonder how much more anxious they might be, if they depended
on the cycle of mother nature to feed their families. How much
greater would their concerns be if they lived in slums and
townships, in mud houses, or shelters made of plastic bags? In
large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, this is a reality. The poor, the
vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh edge of climate
change every day of their lives. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the Major Economies Meeting in Paris, developed countries
must commit to immediate action against climate change. The United
Nations need to deliver an action plan to save the planet at the
climate change conference in 2009. There is no time to be
distracted from the urgent task to deliver this global rescue plan.
The world is watching, and those who are feeling the impacts of
climate change today, are expecting decisive action - now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;US burden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an attendee of the MEM, South Africa's environment minister
immediately condemned Bush's speech by saying: "There is no way
whatsoever that we can agree to what the US is proposing, which
means that the fundamental distinction between developed and
developing countries should be erased and that we should turn a
blind eye to historical responsibility for the problem. In effect,
the US wants developing countries that already face huge poverty
and development challenges to pay for what the US and other highly
industrialized countries have caused over the past 150 years. We
are willing to do our fair share to address the climate challenge,
but not to carry a part of the US's burden."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries participating in Bush's meeting are: Japan,
France, Germany, Italy, the UK, China, Canada, India, Brazil, South
Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesian, and South Africa. The
countries most at risk from impacts of climate change - such as
small island developing states like Tuvalu - are not even invited
to be at the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arieta Moceica of Greenpeace Australia Pacific said from Suva,
Fiji: "While small islands like my own are sinking, Bush and
Sarkozy are wasting everyone's time in Paris at talks that fail to
deliver the rapid emissions reductions we need. The Paris talks
behind closed doors are nothing but a slap in the face of those
already suffering from climate change today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;To maintain its independence, Greenpeace accepts no donations from corporations or governments. We rely entirely on support from millions of people like you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
