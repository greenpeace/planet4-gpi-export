	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace – Yes Men spoof newspaper declares climate deal </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iht-se/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Justice for the Tokyo Two - justice for whales, coming our way?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/justice-for-the-tokyo-two-ju/</url><text>
	Justice is starting to go the Tokyo Two way: A court in Aomori, Japan, has delivered a series of setbacks to the prosecution in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki (the activists known as the Tokyo Two) - and the Japanese government's attempts to cover up an embezzlement scandal within the whaling industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan Campaigns Director Junichi Sato faces up to ten years in prison for exposing corruption in the whaling industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the court has ruled that evidence of the embezzlement scandal cannot be excluded. Second, the issue of whether or not Junichi and Toru's actions are protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can and will be discussed during the trial. Third, the court has requested that the prosecutor come forward with witness testimonies that may prove crucial to the case - and to further disclose evidence of the whale meat scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor had previously been attempting to portray the actions of Junichi and Toru as being a simple case of theft, and to block any discussion of the embezzlement. The court has rightly refused to accept this, ruling that this evidence cannot be excluded - evidence which details the exposure by Junichi and Toru of a major corruption scandal within the Japanese government-sponsored Southern Ocean whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru risk up to ten years in jail if convicted of theft. They removed a box of embezzled whale meat from a mail depot last year, and presented it to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor, who immediately opened up an investigation into corruption in the government-subsidised whaling programme. The investigation was later discontinued - on the same day that Junichi and Toru were arrested, and the Greenpeace Japan office raided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has urged the prosecutor to disclose evidence that he's been holding back. This includes statements made to police by the "owner" of the intercepted box of whale meat;  by several individuals who purportedly entrusted their whale meat to him, and by an employee of whaling fleet operator Kyodo Senpaku, who made the arrangements to transport the crewmembers' "personal luggage" from the ship to their homes. If that sounds murky, it's probably because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this trial, we want to establish that what Junichi and Toru did was to corroborate information provided by whistleblowers regarding embezzlement within the Kyodo Senpaku whaling fleet," said the Tokyo Two's defence lawyer, Yuichi Kaido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the prosecutor's opinion being rejected by the court, we have gained a foothold in this case and the opportunity to prove that there was indeed embezzlement of whale meat by employees."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that prosecutor's attempts to keep the whale meat scandal and several witnesses out of the courtroom, and thus the public eye, has only resulted in making the judges more curious. Maybe it's because the prosecutor knows that the whaling industry really has something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The government was hoping to bury this scandal by putting the messengers on trial," said Jun Hoshikawa, Greenpeace Japan Executive Director. "However, as more evidence of embezzlement comes to light, at the end of the day it will be whaling that is on trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If the Japanese government is going to arrest people for the crime of opposing whaling, they are going to need a lot of handcuffs.  Are you a suspect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us defend the Tokyo Two, and oppose whaling.  Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations. We rely on you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A new exhibit in Aomori, Japan, gives a glimpse of Greenpeace history through one of our iconic communication tools: the t-shirt.

            Mai Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan and Fanny Lee of Greenpeace China at exhibition of Greenpeace t-shirts in Aomori, Japan, where two Greenpeace activists are on trial.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our campaigns have spawned many, many tees -- from the funny to the shrill, the plain and functional to the artistic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as action tools, as when activists aboard the Greenpeace ship Sirius were being escorted out of the Soviet Union, and in front of whirring cameras revealed the message "Stop Nuclear Testing" in Russian on the t-shirts  beneath their sweatshirts.  Or when activists in the high-security zone around a Star Wars missile test wore "Don't Shoot" tees -- messaging both the missile masters and the gun-toting guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as barter items with border guards, coveted and swapped among ships' crew, and sought after by collectors looking to create a complete timeline of the organisation in organic cotton. When our Japanese office put out the call to Greenpeacers around the world to empty their closets, they got nearly 200 examples of the art of the body billboard from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organiser Mai Suzuki, activist and Greenpeace t-shirt collector, hopes to tell the public about environmental risks and Greenpeace's efforts to tackle them in a simple and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many of us wear T-shirts every day. When you wear a Greenpeace T-Shirt, everyone can look at you on the street. It is a potent and direct way of communicating information," said Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157619186149933&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition also highlights the global support behind the Aomori communications centre, which was set up earlier this year to bring Greenpeace messages directly to people of the port city. Aomori is where Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are currently on trial for intercepting a box of embezzled whale meat, with the aim of exposing a long-standing culture of embezzlement within the government-sponsored whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They succeeded in exposing the scandal, but are now on trial themselves for "theft", despite having given the whale meat to the public prosecutor as evidence for an investigation into the embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition showcases a new t-shirt from Greenpeace UK, which was recently worn by activists during activities supporting Junichi and Tory, known as the "Tokyo Two", in London.  (Nudge, nudge -- you can &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;buy a version of that t-shirt at our online shop&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki hopes that the T-Shirts will show the Japanese public the passion Greenpeace has for its campaigns, and that it inspires them to take action themselves to right environmental wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is my wish that the public come and take a look at the T-Shirts, and realise that they have the power to change the world," said Suzuki.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;When you buy a Greenpeace t-shirt, the proceeds help keep us going. When you wear a Greenpeace t-shirt, you help spread the word about our campaigns. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;T-shirts alone can't keep our ships at sea and our activists free.  Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate challenge even greater after UN meeting in Bonn</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonntwo150609/</url><text>
	As another round of Bonn climate talks limps to a close, and the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December this year draws closer and closer, it’s a good opportunity to take a look at the progress that’s been made so far…
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Negotiators at the UN climate talks in Bonn failed to answer the call for emergency action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, almost everything is now on the table. On the minus side, almost everything now on the table is still on the table, and doesn't look likely to be going anywhere fast. In fact, one draft document that was 50 pages long at the start of the Bonn meeting is now closer to 300 pages long. Given that one of the purposes of this meeting was to narrow options down, it's safe to assume that 'progress', therefore, has not been significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money from the industrialised world to help developing countries to switch to clean energy, keep tropical rainforests intact and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts is still missing from the table. But the biggest space of all is where the robust, effective emissions cuts for industrialised countries should be. The science demands that, as a group, these countries need to cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of irreversible climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaders need apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate change issue has to be passed right to the top of the political 'food chain'. Heads of governments must take responsibility for protecting the climate and, in so doing, protecting the planet and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. There's probably not a single ministry or government department that remains untouched by this issue; energy, environment, foreign affairs, treasury - the list goes on. And every single one of them will have its own perspectives and priorities. In every capital city around the world, the person who has the 'big picture' - the person who sits at the desk where the buck ultimately stops - needs to stand up, step up and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next chance for action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, the heads of the world's richest countries will get together in Italy for the G8 Summit. This will be an historical opportunity for these leaders to break the deadlock and send a strong signal of intent by agreeing deep cuts in emissions and putting money on the table for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December around 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon destruction not such a good look </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/slaughteringtheamazon-160609/</url><text>
	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to campaign for a green and peaceful future. You will make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Obama: You won it, now earn it</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/obama-nobel-peace101209/</url><text>
	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/climatepolicy"&gt;Other briefings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Two years have passed since world leaders promised all of us a deal to stop climate change. After two weeks of UN negotiations, politicians breezed in, had dinner with the Queen, a three hour lunch, took some photos and then delivered what could only be described as the 24 hour Head of State tourist brochure of Copenhagen instead of a climate treaty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Think or Swim!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't believe the hype, there is nothing fair, ambitious or legally binding about this deal. The job of world leaders is not done. Today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/PageFiles/24942/cop15-assessment.pdf"&gt;Click here for a detailed assessment of the Copenhagen Accord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene tonight, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good, to avert catastrophic climate change. What we needed was a legally binding agreement that was fair to developing countries and ambitious when it came to emissions cuts and ending deforestation. In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through. We've seen a year of crises, but today it is clear that the biggest one facing humanity is a leadership crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's to blame?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year, a number of developing countries showed a willingness to accept their share of the burden to avert climate chaos. But in the end, the blame for failure mostly lies with the rich industrialised world, countries which have the largest historic responsibility for causing the problem. In particular, the US failed to take any real leadership and dragged the talks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are saying that we have only a few years left to stop the rise in emissions before making the kind of rapid reductions that would give us the best chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. We cannot change that science, so instead we will have to change the politics - and we may well have to change the politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen million people demanded that world leaders take responsibility and make good on their promise to deliver a real deal to save the climate. World leaders clearly heard us - echoing our messages in many of their own speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not over, people everywhere demanded a real deal before the Summit began and they are still demanding it. We can still save hundreds of millions of people from the devastation of a warming world, but it has just become a whole lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Executive Director and chair of the tcktcktck coalition, Kumi Naidoo said "Civil society, the bulk of which was locked out of the final days of this Climate Summit, now needs to redouble its efforts. Each and every one of us must hold our leaders to account. We must take the struggle to avert climate catastrophe into every level of politics, local, regional, national and international. We also need to take it into the board room and onto the high streets. We can either work for a fundamental change in our society or we can suffer the consequences of one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/me2"&gt;Together with other environmental and social justice groups, we are building the largest movement of civil society the world has ever witnessed. Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.

        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck. 
&lt;div&gt;

            Parody of the logo of French nuclear fuel company, Areva, manufacturer of the steam generators aboard the Happy Ranger.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/go2copenhagen"&gt;Demand our leaders lead by signing a fair, ambitious, legally binding deal to stop climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/11/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	High-tech smuggling operations may not be what you'd normally associate with the ongoing clearance of the Amazon rainforest, but logging companies intent on plundering it for timber have been using hackers to break into the Brazilian government's sophisticated tracking system and fiddle the records.

&lt;p&gt;To monitor the amount of timber leaving the Amazon state of
Pará, the Brazilian environment ministry did away with paper
dockets and two years ago introduced an online system. Companies
logging the rainforest for timber or charcoal production are only
allowed to fell a certain amount of timber every year and this is
controlled by the use of transport permits issued by the state
government's computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be exported from Pará, each shipment of timber requires one
of these transport permits, and the volume of timber in each
shipment is deducted from the total amount allowed under the
company's forest management plan. Once that amount is reduced to
zero, no more transport permits are issued so there's no profit in
felling more trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil, the world's "hacking capital"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what's supposed to happen. But today the public
prosecutor will release details of how hackers employed by 107
logging and charcoal companies have compromised the system,
falsifying online records to increase the timber transport
allocations for certain areas of the forest. In the past, Brazil
has been called the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3657170.stm"&gt;world's
hacking capital&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href="http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;amp;name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;amp;sid=743"&gt;
history of criminal gangs&lt;/a&gt; hacking into bank computer systems to
engage in large-scale online fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hacking has led to 1.7million cubic metres of timber being
illegally smuggled out of Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the Amazon hacking scandal is that nearly 1.7
million cubic metres of illegal timber have been smuggled out of
the Amazon, enough to fill 780 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The
sums of money involved are also huge, and the public prosecutor is
suing the companies responsible for 2 billion reais (US $833m).
According to federal prosecutor Daniel Avelino, many of these
companies have a track record of illegal practices: "Almost half of
the companies involved in this scam have other law suits pending
for environmental crimes or the use of slave labour, amongst other
things."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investigation started in April 2007&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police started investigating the suspect hackers in April 2007,
swooping in a couple of months later to arrest 30 ring leaders. One
is still in jail - the intermediary who brought the hackers and the
loggers together - in total, 202 people are facing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André Muggiati, campaigner in our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/"&gt;Amazon office&lt;/a&gt; in
Manaus, told me they have flagged up potential security holes in
the past. "We've pointed out before that this method of controlling
the transport of timber was subject to fraud. And this is only the
tip of the iceberg, because the same computer system is also used
in two other Brazilian states."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By hacking into the permit system, these companies have made
their timber shipments appear legal and compliant with the forest
management plans. But in reality, they're trading illegal timber
which is making the problem of deforestation worse, and a lack of
control and policing in the areas they're logging means they think
they can get away with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Scandal comes as Brazilian national congress prepares to vote
on forest code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scandal weren't bad enough, it comes as the Brazilian
national congress prepares to vote on a change to the country's
forest code which could massively increase the amount of legal
logging that will be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, land owners in the Amazon are able to clear trees
from 20 per cent of their property but if the proposed changes are
adopted, it will raise that to 50 per cent. Given the contentious
nature of land ownership in the region, no one knows exactly the
damage this will cause but as deforestation rates are once again on
the increase, it's certain to push them up even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil must adopt a zero deforestation plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scandal of loggers and hackers just demonstrates that the
Brazilian government is failing to protect the Amazon forest from
logging companies determined to break the law. If the rainforest is
to have any long-term future, the only answer is to adopt a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt;
zero deforestation plan&lt;/a&gt;, like the one we and other campaign
groups think is needed, setting ambitious targets to bring
deforestation under control. Otherwise illegal logging and
corporate fraud such this will continue to be a massive
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

	Europe is known more for its ancient cities than ancient forests. And if Finnish paper companies have their way, there may soon be nothing left of the old forests that once covered most of Europe. But Greenpeace activists confronted paper imports in Germany to expose the ongoing destruction of Finland's forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint 'Forest Crime in Europe' on the hull of a paper carried to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists onboard inflatable boats intercepted the paper carrier "Finn Hawk" as it entered the Baltic Port of Luebeck in Germany. As the Finn Hawk navigated towards its berth, the activists painted "Forest Crime in Europe" on the hull of the ship to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finn Hawk is loaded with paper products from the Finnish paper companies Stora Enso and M-Real; both continue to buy wood for its products from the last of Finland's ancient forests. Other activists on the pier held a banner that read "Forest ministers of Europe: save our ancient forests".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want European ministers to make the right decisions to increase ancient forest protection in Europe during next week's Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe taking place in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after numerous conversations over the last 12 months, the paper companies have taken no real measures to stop the destruction of ancient forests in Finland. In fact, they are peddling their ancient forest destruction to Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few areas of Europe's formerly vast ancient forests still exist in Finland. Less than five percent of the current Finnish forest cover is ancient forest and only half of that is protected from industrial logging and further destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami and other traditional communities. In the north-eastern part of Finland, many ancient forest areas are still unprotected and are being destroyed by the state-owned forest enterprise Metsahallitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main customers for the timber harvested by Metsahallitus are three international paper companies. This ancient forest timber is processed into pulp, magazine grade, fine paper and cardboard in the Finnish paper mills of Stora Enso, UPM Kymmene and M-Real then shipped to destinations in Europe and overseas. The ancient forests ends up as copy paper, envelopes, packaging, and in a range of publications from magazines and newspapers to advertising flyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, very few ancient forests and high conservation value forests are protected in Europe. Greenpeace is calling on European ministers to make real decisions to further the protection of the last ancient forests instead of only stressing sustainable forest management, which can not adequately protect Europe's forests alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure you are not buying products coming from ancient forest destruction, look for the FSC® logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC®, or Forest Stewardship Council™, is an international non-profit organisation that issues certificates for well managed forests and was created so that corporate buyers and individual consumers can identify products coming from responsible forest management. Look for the FSC® logo to the left on wood and paper products to make sure you aren't buying forest destruction or supporting illegal logging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When buying paper products, look closely to make sure they are made from 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper or other agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Glimmer of hope for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pacific-tuna-hope121208/</url><text>
	The final outcome of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is too weak to stop overfishing of Pacific bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Pacific islanders are still at great risk from the collapse of this fishery. But the decision to close two of the high seas pockets, between Pacific Island countries, to purse seine fishing from 2010 has left them with a shred of hope.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/5/a-yellow-fin-tuna-sits-on-the.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will also consider the closure of a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
third high seas area&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. We have been campaigning for
these areas to be designated as marine reserves &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/where-are-the-pacific-tuna/"&gt;
since 2004&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, our ship, Esperanza, patrolled these high seas areas
for over ten weeks. During this time we took action againstfishing
fleets from &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;
Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-demonstra"&gt;
Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3"&gt;
US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pacific-pirate-busted100508/"&gt;
Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support sustainable fisheries, protect marine life
and clean up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; in the region - &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning since 2001 that the bigeye and
yellowfin stocks in the Pacific are in decline and recommended a
minimum 30 percent reduction in fishing for 2009. Yet the
commission only agreed to cut fishing on bigeye tuna with a range
of measures including a 10 percent reduction for longliners
only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25073/greenpeace-activists-from-fiji.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Greenpeace activists from Fiji and
Papua New Guinea stand on juvenileyellowfin and skipjack tuna in
the hold of a vessel that was caughtoffloading fish from purse
seiners in the Pacific Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuna exterminators strike back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Island countries, and the US
all put up a strong front to save the Pacific tuna. But resistance
from Japan, Korea, China, Chinese Taipei and the Philippines meant
that fishing will not be reduced enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nations, with a huge appetite for tuna, resisted moves to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, despite strong
economic arguments. Recent studies indicate that the fishing
industry is undermining its own profits by having too many fishing
vessels on the water and by depleting stocks to the point that fish
are harder to catch. We've been calling for a precautionary 50
percent fishing reduction in order to ensure both the long term
sustainability and profitability of the fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just add water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than protecting their fishing future - these
shortsighted governments are sending entire species into oblivion.
As usual consensus based decision making ensured that many
agreements were diluted to the lowest common denominator -
determined only by short term interests. The needs of the Pacific
Island States, whose livelihoods and economies depend on tuna, have
been neglected yet again - despite members of the fishing industry
calling upon these nations to follow the advice of scientists and
reduce fishing by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets and marine reserves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save fish for the future we're now calling on
retailers and fish purchasers  to stop buying all overfished
bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as well as skipjack caught using
fish aggregation devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also continuing to push for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of fully protected marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; covering 40
percent of our oceans. This will help to; buffer our seas from the
ravages of climate change, restore the health of fish stocks and
protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Thanks to donations from individuals like you - we are able to support the Pacific islanders who are trying to preserve their way of life and economies.

	The nuclear industry has had fifty years of massive subsidies and state help – but has delivered only unsafe, expensive power, contamination and waste that will last for thousands of generations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/12/mickey-mouse-climate-solutions.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mickey Mouse climate solutions
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, over 350 non-governmental organisations including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF told delegates at the UN climate talks that nuclear power is not a climate solution but a dangerous distraction from investment in renewable power and energy efficiency. Representing millions of members in 48 countries, the organisations have proclaimed nuclear power a "Mickey Mouse climate solution" and delivered a global call to keep it out of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to pass up the chance of ever more state support and win more taxpayers' money, the nuclear industry is presenting itself as a practical solution to climate change. One of the privileges this dirty and dying industry wants now is to become eligible for support under Kyoto Treaty mechanisms. If that goes through, a country such as France could finance the construction of a reactor in a developing country by a French firm - giving money to its own companies and claiming "emission allowances" for itself so that it doesn't have to reduce its own domestic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to include nuclear power in the Kyoto Protocol CDM is currently being discussed at the UN Climate talks in Poznan These talks coincide with a run of bad news for the nuclear industry that makes its claims of clean cheap power even harder to justify. Following the news of soaring costs for the European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) in &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/epr_history_repeating_costs_up.html"&gt; France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/the_financial_times_finlands_s.html"&gt; Finland&lt;/a&gt; and  in the estimated budgets for &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/dont_believe_the_hype.html"&gt; reactors planned in the US&lt;/a&gt;, came the news that South-Africa - till now seen as one of the most promising candidates for a so-called nuclear "renaissance" - &lt;a title="Nukes out of Africa" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/non_merci_areva_is_out_of_afri.html"&gt;is backing off for a while&lt;/a&gt;: the planned French reactors are simply too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented its pro-nuclear case in Poznan last week, we were there to confront them with reality. And the IAEA had no defence other than to say that things would get better in the future! This is something that we and our parents have been hearing for fifty years now. The IAEA needs to stop dreaming - the climate will not wait and we need to get serious about combating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bring some facts to the debate, Greenpeace has prepared &lt;a title="Facts on Nuclear Power" href="/international/PageFiles/25075/getting-serious-about-nuclear.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Together with other NGOs, we also organised our own official "side event" in Poznan - a specialised session that exposed the facts behind the nuclear "renaissance" smokescreen: nuclear power has been in decline in recent years, with more reactors being closed than built; escalating costs combined with the recent financial crisis are having a devastating effect on the nuclear industry's reputation with financial institutions and bankers. We were delighted to see a crowd of over 100 press and country delegates getting detailed facts on the poor performance of the nuclear industry, something the nuclear industry has been trying to hide from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This side event alone isn't going to stop the nuclear lobby trying to sneak in by the backdoor to get its grubby hands on climate mitigation funding. But it's clear there's a very depressed mood in the nuclear industry's camp, and that negotiators and press from all over the whole world are beginning to understand that the nuclear "renaissance" hype is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Tell governments the world is watching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Sending out an SOS for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tuna-sos-081208/</url><text>
	Our activists together with Korean environmental group KFEM created a huge human "SOS Tuna" banner on the shores of a beach in Busan, Korea, as a key regional meeting in Korea began this week. This extremely critical meeting will decide the fate of valuable tuna stocks in the Pacific, which are now seriously threatened due to overfishing.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Time and tuna are running out!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific ocean is rich in marine life and home to over 20 IslandNations. Today, the Pacific supplies over 6 percent of the world's tuna. Butoverfishing in other areas of the world means more and more boats aremoving in, and chasing fewer and fewer fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge industrial tuna boats, capable of catching as many tuna in onetrip as some of the countries are able to take in a year, areplundering this vulnerable region at a rate that means trouble for thetuna as well as the people whose livelihoods and futures depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These boats originate from countries like Korea, Japan and Taiwan andfeed the ever-increasing appetites for tuna in the luxury Asian, European and US markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not just about saving some fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lives and economies of Pacific Islanders and Pacific Island nations are in peril as big eye and yellow fin tuna stocks are threatened from overfishing. Pacific communities are at the mercy of unscrupulous foreign fishersand our growing global appetite for tuna is in the grip of unfair andunsustainable fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on delegates at this week's Western and CentralPacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting in Korea to implement measures fora sustainable and profitable fishing industry. TheWCPFC must start putting words into action byagreeing on strong and effective measures. A precautionary and ecosystem-based approach isneeded to preserve the rich marine diversity of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce, protect and reject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be an immediate halving offishing, a closure to fishing in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt; the high seas pockets&lt;/a&gt; and an immediatehalt to the transfer of fish at sea to discourage piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCPFC must ensure decisions are not hijacked againby a small minority of nations that are not acting in the best interestof Pacific people, their valuable tuna resources andthe health of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one last chance to ensure the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks do notface the same fate as bluefin tuna of the Mediterranean. The Commission has to be preparedto face the consequences if negotiations break down to governments andindustry ruthlessly bargaining for the last tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship, the Esperanza, is present in Korea to bear witness tothe WCPFC's decisions, which will dictate the future of Pacific tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea should lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have joined forces with Korean environmental group KFEM to ensure that Korea, as the host nation and key player in the fishery, takes the lead in making sure that this meeting takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need marine reserves which will fully protect the most vulnerable breeding grounds of the tuna from exploitation. We need sustainable management measures outside those areas that will secure a future for this fishery and for the future of the millions of Pacific island people that depend on this resource for their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow we need marine reserves today. Join the call for a global network of marine reserves protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to attend meetings like this one in Korea to pressure governments who need to make the right decisions to protect our planet. We don't take any corporate or government donations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Representatives of millions of Greenpeace supporters from around the world arrived at the doorstep of the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo today to demand an end to the political persecution of two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, and an end to Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean. Embassy actions are scheduled around the world today and tomorrow.

            A "living statue" of Lady justice protests on behalf of Greenpeace in front of the Japanese embassy in The Hague, Netherlands.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-defendants include the chief whale-defenders (officially, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/whaling-on-trial-120508/about-the-co-defendants/"&gt; Executive Directors&lt;/a&gt;) of Greenpeace offices from Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil, USA and the Nordic countries, as well as Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Condemned by Amnesty International&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the group  declared themselves 'co-defendants' in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki. The two Greenpeace activists exposed corruption in the taxpayer-funded whaling industry, but were themselves &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; arrested in a crackdown on Greenpeace itself in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a million Greenpeace supporters wrote to the Prime Minister to demand their release. The arrest was &lt;a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/japan-must-respect-rights-of-detained-greenpeace-activists-20080715" target="_blank"&gt;denounced by Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, and fits a pattern of repression of the rights of free speech in Japan which has been condemned by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group challenged the Prime Minister to set Junichi and Toru free, and end the corrupt whaling programme, or order their own arrest for daring to oppose the whaling programme. 30,000 people have also &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;signed petitions declaring themselves complicit in Junichi and Toru's actions&lt;/a&gt;, and stated that if defending whales is a crime, they too are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want Prime Minister Aso to know that if Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are to be tried for exposing whale meat embezzlement and working to endthe killing of whales in the Japanese Government's 'research' programmein the Southern Ocean, then we should all be arrested," said JunHoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "It's not Greenpeace activists who should be put on trial; it is the government-backed  whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a Greenpeace undercover investigation in May 2008 that exposed the embezzlement of whale meat from the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet, Japanese authorities responded with a politically-motivated prosecution, arresting Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki and raiding the Greenpeace Japan office in June 2008. They have now been awaiting trial for 172 days under bail conditions which prevent hem from continuing their Greenpeace campaign work to end whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to begin early next year; they are both facing upto 10 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-us"&gt;events will be happening throughout today and tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; at Japanese embassies in Brazil, USA, New Zealand, Argentina, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Canada,  Italy and on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, activists declared themselves as 'co-defendants', by asking the Japanese government to "Arrest Me Too" and to put "Whaling on Trial".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proof of life after whaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart, in Tokyo to support the TokyoTwo and the campaign to end Japan's whaling, was a master and gunner atthe Cheynes Beach Whaling Station in Western Australia until it ceasedoperation in 1978 - following Greenpeace protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm here to assure whalers that there is life after whaling. Japan'swhaling programme is a taxpayer-funded government enterprise, so when it finally ends, it's the responsibility of the Japanese government and theFisheries Agency to retrain the crews for other, sustainable, work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Australia alone, 300 million Australian dollars are made every year fromwhalewatching - hundreds of times more than was ever made by the whalingindustry", said Hart. "I am proud of my time at sea, but it was 30 yearsago. Times have changed, and the world has moved on - whaling no longerhas a place in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We're all Junichi and Toru&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2008/12/junichi-toru-mask-thumbs.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="304"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know the story of Spartacus? He was the leader of a slave revolt in ancient Rome.  When soldiers put down the uprising, the Romans demanded to know which of the slaves was Spartacus.  One by one, each slave stood up to declare that he was Spartacus, masking their leader's true identiy and declaring their unity with his cause.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If you have ever done anything to oppose Japanese whaling, you're probably guilty in the eyes of the Japanese government of the same crime as Junichi and Toru. Fess up. Sign the petition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Help keep activists like Junichi and Toru working to stop whaling. Help keep our Japanese office running. Help us end whaling forever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activists in India, taking part in the 2008 Global Day of Action for the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 23 countries from Australia to Italy to Mexico to the Philippines to Turkey to the US joined or led a series of protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that Ministers arriving in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/un-climate-conference/"&gt; Poznan&lt;/a&gt; listen to the will of their citizens, and get serious about climate action. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YM806Vheo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the action day in Poznan itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world is watching governments in Poznan" said Mareike Britten, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner. "Saturday's actions clearly show that people across the world recognise that it's time for governments to get serious about climate action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a flash mob of people in swimming gear in Amsterdam, to protests in Red Square, Moscow to banner messages on Aztec pyramids in Mexico, to installing solar panels in Thailand, and giving a solar powered Parol (a Filipino Christmas lantern) to the Philippine senate, to a giant postcards reading "Dear World Leaders, we are ready to save the climate" in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, to a boat protest on the Ganga River in India, our map below highlights key Greenpeace activities across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take action! The global day of action is over, but it's not too late for you tell your government you are watching them. Join activists from around the world by &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt; uploading your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the Poznan meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

	If we are to avert catastrophic climate change the world must quit coal. But, the industry and the powerful forces which rely on it will not go down without a fight. Today, in Warsaw, Greenpeace, provided them with two reminders of why we should quit coal. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tell major global polluters in Poland to "Get Serious, Quit Coal".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists dumped coal on the doorstep of a luxury Warsaw hotel, where industry ministers from 20 countries are meeting to discuss coal's future, unveiling a banner saying 'Get serious, quit coal!'. Greenpeace has also published a report on the "True Cost of Coal": estimating the annual financial costs of coals' climate impact, health impact and the cost of deadly mining accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the Polish Government, the conference documents claim that the meeting is being held to agree on policies to help the climate - but the agenda reveals it is about saving profits, not the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background documents on the 'Summit on Sectoral Cooperation,' describe coal as the main fuel for power generation in the future and discuss "adequate policy actions."  The documents hold up the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as a "spectacular" example of good policy initiatives on climate protection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this partnership is just a coal pact - an agreement by some of the world's leading polluters to do nothing in particular, by no particular time and in no particular way.  In the face of catastrophic climate change that's worse than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Cost of Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with this meeting is the release of our report "The True Cost of Coal", which describes the costs coal imposes on society. Produced in conjunction with the independent Dutch Institute CE Delft, the report puts a price tag on some of the more obvious damages caused along the coal chain-of-custody, including climate change, health impacts from air pollution and loss of life from mining accidents.  Last year, these damages cost the world at least 360 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all the costs of coal can be measured in dollars and cents. In Columbia, indigenous communities are threatened and forced off their lands to make way for coal mines; thousands in Jharia, India, suffer from horrendous living conditions because of uncontrollable coal fires; in Russia, unsafe mining conditions have meant injury and death for scores of workers. We tell twelve of these stories in our report, but there are thousands more to be found wherever coal is mined or burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places like Indonesia, China and Thailand, air pollution from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, damaging ancient relics, reducing crop yields and killing people. The legacy of mining ensures that land in South Africa will continue to be poisoned by acid mine drainage long after mines are closed. Iin the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland, mining activities have caused the water level of Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically. In the United States coal has meant blowing up mountains, burying streams and contaminating nearby communities. In Germany, reclaiming opencast mines has created dead lakes with water as acid as vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in response to the unmitigated destruction and harm caused by coal, communities are rising up.  In Australia, winemakers, horse breeders, local residents and miners are saying no to mine expansion and yes to a just transition to renewable energy.  In the Philippines, a diverse group has united to oppose a new coal-fired power station, calling instead for clean energy development.  Stories such as these inspire, provide hope and point towards a better future - one not marred by dirty coal but fuelled by energy sources that are safe, sustainable and will protect our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is days away from sealing a deal on its own response to climate change, with a series of laws known as the 'climate package', which should provide a boost to renewable energy and reduce Europe's reliance on coal.  The European position will have a massive bearing on global negotiations to strengthen the successor to the Kyoto Protocol, culminating in Copenhagen at the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25082/true-cost-of-coal-report-launc.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poland threatens climate package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is currently threatening to block the EU package. Despite a recent report  showing that implementing the proposed climate package would benefit the Polish economy, vested interests have convinced the Polish government otherwise. Poland generates 90% of its power from burning coal, and the industry has convinced the government that their interests come before those of the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why there won't be any representatives from the renewable industry attending the Sheraton shindig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future without coal is not only possible, it is necessary if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change. The most effective way to do this is for the world to work together under one agreement. Poland, host of the upcoming climate talks, in Poznan, could have designed a meeting to help progress towards an environmentally effective global agreement on climate protection rather than one likely to hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're calling on all countries at the UN climate negotiations next week to get serious and put a meaningful proposal on the table. The proposal must include a "climate vision" which will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40%, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Time To Lead" href="http://www.timetolead.eu/" target="_blank"&gt;Tell EU Leaders to defend the climate package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UN climate negotiations begin in Poznan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/un-climate-conference/</url><text>
	It has been a year since governments in Bali pledged to nail down an agreement to save the climate by December 2009. That means they have one year left to agree on how to stop the climate crisis. This year’s UN meeting on Climate Change has just started in Poznan, Poland and we think it is about time for government leaders to stop the talking, get serious and start real negotiations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/get-serious-quit-coal-greenp.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real climate action means quitting our addiction to coal. It's time to get serious.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest destruction costs the world economy at least 2 trillion dollars annually. Ocean fish stocks are collapsing, putting a basic source of food for 3 billion people at risk. Droughts and forest fires are destroying our planet's most precious resources and rising sea levels are threatening to displace hundreds of millions of people before the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn't all bad news, the good news is that the solution is pretty simple: to avoid runaway climate change, the world needs to quit its addiction to coal and stop destroying forests - and that work has to start in Poznan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start investing in a future we can all believe in. We need investments in clean, renewable energy and an end to subsidies for dirty and dangerous energy like coal and nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Rescue Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some government leaders have proven that they cannot be trusted to take swift action on climate change based on the facts. From the coal mines of Konin, to the meeting rooms at the UN meetings in Poznan, we are taking action to make sure that government leaders know it is time to get serious about climate change and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  &lt;a title="QUIT COAL" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/"&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/a&gt; has set up a &lt;a title="CLIMATE RESCUE STATION" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/climate-rescue/"&gt;Climate Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; in Konin, Poland- one hour form the UN meeting - to highlight the true cost of coal in the lead up to crucial UN climate negotiations. The Rescue Station is currently set up on the edge of an open pit coal mine where activists have been demanding an end to our addiction to coal in a series of direct actions. On 8 December, a week into the talks, the dome will be moved to Poznan town square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that the truth is heard at the UN meetings, we've also sent a team of climate experts to Poznan. We are there to pressure governments to quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate. Our message to delegates is simple - it's time to get serious about tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not just another meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year doesn't seem like a lot of time to most of us, considering the scope of the problem. After two decades of climate negotiations, governments are still tip-toeing around each other when it comes to real solutions to climate change. This year the world is watching the UN negotiations and demanding that governments make good on their promise to come up with an action plan in Copenhagen next year. Be a part of the action and &lt;a title="THE WORLD IS WATCHING" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;upload your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the UN meeting in Poznan, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's what we need from our leaders in Poznan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Developed countries must agree greenhouse gas emission reduction targets at the upper end of 25-40%, as identified by the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Make sure government leaders know that The World is Watching and we expect them to commit to a climate deal at next year's talks in Copenhagen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely donations from individuals like you. We don't accept money from governments of corporations.Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Shameless. Disastrous. The international body responsible for "managing" what's left of the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna stock has ignored scientific advice, the demands of Greenpeace supporters around the world, and the pleas of the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa and the United States to save the fishery from collapse.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Captive Bluefin Tuna inside a transport cage.Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the Mediterranean to protect bluefin tuna with marine reserves in their breeding and feeding areas.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt;Bluefin tuna is highlyprized in Asian markets as sushi, and overfishing has decimated thestocks. Bluefin are slow to mature and many young tuna are caughtbefore they have the chance to reproduce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greenpeace and other environmental groups have called for the closure of the bluefin tuna fisheries, to give them time to recover. But the governments responsible for managing the fishery are refusing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), concluded in Marrakech with an agreement allowing over 22,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna to be landed -- around 7,500 tonnes over the level recommended by scientists to avoid the collapse of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last-chance tuna bazaar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fall under the 'management' of ICCAT, a body made up of government representation from 45 countries plus the European Community.&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But this year's session looked more like a bazaar, in which buyers haggled over the last remaining tuna, than an international meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management plan they agreed to fails to protect the spawning population and merely shortens  the purse seine fishing season, responsible for the bulk of illegal catches, by 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union, representing the majority of Mediterranean countries with interests in the bluefin tuna fishery, bullied other parties in the meeting into agreeing to management proposals which completely fail to follow the advice of ICCAT's own scientific body to substantially reduce fishing and protect the species' spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure from the European countries has been so strong that they have even managed to slow downthe 'payback' for the illegal catches made in the region in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Time for new management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"The game is over - ICCAT has missed its last chance to save the bluefin tuna from stock collapse," said Sebastian Losada, Greenpeace Spain Oceans Campaigner, who has been attending the Marrakech meeting. "Bluefin tuna has become an endangered species because of ICCAT mismanagement. It's time to take the fishery out of their hands and look to Conventions like CITES to impose trade restrictions on thespecies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"These past seven days have demonstrated that ICCAT is a farce," said Losada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;In 2006, following years of extremely high levels of pirate fishing, among others by European Union fishing vessels, ICCAT agreed a bluefin tuna "recovery plan" that set a 'Total Allowable Catch' of 29,500 tonnes for the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;ICCAT's own Scientific Committee recommended a sustainable limit of 15,000 tonnes. Since then, the very same scientists have estimated that actual bluefin tuna catches were about 61,000 tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; Greenpeace demanded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; a closure of the fishery&lt;/a&gt; until a proper recovery plan is inplace including at a very minimum a Total Allowed Catch (TAC) in line with the scientific advice, a seasonal closure covering the months of May, June and July and the establishment of marine reserves to protect the bluefin tuna spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Disgrace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the main fishing countries such as Spain and France, which currently leads the Union of 27 Member States, should bear the brunt of the criticism for this shameful outcome. They have again placed short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species, and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently released performance review of ICCAT written by a panel of experts appointed by ICCAT itself recommended&lt;em&gt; "the suspension of fishing on bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" and&lt;/em&gt; states that "&lt;em&gt;the management ... of this bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is widely seen as an international disgrace.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, ICCAT has lived up to that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.  Join the call to protect 40 percent of our world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish mine workers attack peaceful Greenpeace protest</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-rescue-attacked-241108/</url><text>
	Peaceful protesters from the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station were attacked by mine workers when they entered the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine. As the activists prepared to paint a huge "Stop" sign next to a giant excavator they were assaulted and prevented from carrying out their peaceful protest. A journalist accompanying the activists was beaten. Local people are also against the expansion of this mine, because it threatens their homes and livelihoods.

            The Climate Rescue Station overlooks the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our action is not against the miners but it is addressed to the Polish government. We demand that the forthcoming Polish energy policy contain a concrete plan for quitting coal and implementing renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also object to opening any new power plants working for lignite. Lignite is the most destructive fuel," says Magdalena Zowsik, Climate and Energy Campaigner in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists at the mine are part of the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station, which was set up two weeks ago at the edge of the mine to bear witness to the destruction and environmental devastation caused by coal. Just last week 400 members of local communities whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by the mine joined us in a peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More then 90 percent of energy in Poland is produced by burning coal, but it doesn't have to be that way. The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution scenario for Poland shows how Poland can make the transition to generating 80 percent of its power using renewable sources. That would mean an end to the destructive mining and devastated countryside that scars Poland. It would also mean Poland would cease to be one of the twenty largest emitters of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland's addiction to coal doesn't just harm its environment, it also drives its role in international talks. With the EU just days away form sealing a deal on a response to climate change Poland is actively trying to water down the package so it can carry on polluting. With Poland also due to host the UN Climate Negotiations on December 1 it is essential that Poland adopts a progressive attitude toward the talks and make itself part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Poland and the world need an energy revolution, not more of the same," adds Zowsik. "The science is unequivocal, if we try to continue burning coal we will do untold damage to the planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, Greenpeace wants to see governments agree a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40 percent cuts, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by the time the next round of climate talks begin in Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>India's light bulb phase out: setting a smart example</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/india-light-bulb-phaseout-250209/</url><text>
	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j2m7rwqERY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three hundred and forty Greenpeace activists were arrested as they took their demand to "Bail out the Planet" to European Union finance ministers in Brussels. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hundreds of activists were arrested as they demanded EU finance ministers "Bail out the planet."
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked the exits of the building where the ministers
were meeting, and demanded an answer on the climate funding
question. Swarms of uniformed officers, riot police and
plain-clothed cops descended on the activists as a line of black
armoured vehicles, police vans and busses moved in to block the
public view of the activist-guarded doors. Electric saws were used
to cut through the locks and police dragged activists face down
into the line of police vehicles. It took the police more than two
hours to remove all of the peaceful activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the men and women of EU finance met to discuss the financial
crisis and the climate crisis, we asked a question: where is the
money to avert runaway climate change? Because it looks to us like
there's far more interest in bailing out banks then in bailing out
a planet headed toward a bankrupt future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions made today by EU finance ministers are important
because they will directly influence Europe's position at the
historic UN climate summit in Copenhagen this December. Richer
developed countries need to contribute at least €110 billion a year
by 2020 to make sure developing countries are able to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable
impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country's contribution towards a climate bailout plan is
based on its ability to pay and its level of responsibility in
causing climate change. Based on this, the  European governments'
share is €35 billion a year by 2020, the equivalent of just €1.30 a
week per European citizen: the price of a bus ticket.  To help
raise these funds, we are supporting a new scheme that puts a price
tag on greenhouse gas emissions and asks rich countries to pay for
their carbon footprint according to their means and their
responsibility for causing the climate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/My/sign-up/"&gt;Be part of the change you want to see in the world. Help us win more campaigns like this one!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EXPOSED! Pirates bankrolled by Spanish government</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-pirates-bankrolled-by/</url><text>
	We've just presented evidence to the Fisheries Committee of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) that the Spanish company Vidal Armadores S. A., despite being involved in pirate fishing, received over 3.5 million Euros in Spanish government subsidies. On top of that, the company is still getting help from the Spanish government in securing contracts and licences to fish in other countries. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real pirates get punished, right? Aarrgh, not in Spain, matey! There they get subsidised.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;Pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; - known by its less colourful name: illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing -&lt;/span&gt; costs the world US$4 billion annually and &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;leaves communities that depend on fish without much needed food and income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;In the Southern Pacific, pirate fishing for the prized Patagonia toothfish (also known as "sea bass") has driven the species to the brink of commercial extinction. &lt;/span&gt;Illegal fleets catching the remaning toothfish here are predominantly controlledby northern hemisphere transnational crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off the radar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is currently running a fleet of at least five vessels in the Southern Ocean, at least three of which are blacklisted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Commission - part of the Antarctic TreatySystem - manages fishing activities in the Southern Ocean. It blacklists vessels for engaging in pirate activity or failing to respect conservation measures, and the 24 member states agree not to buy fish from blacklisted vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a blacklisted vessel transfers its catch at sea to another ship, who is to know? In 2007, CCAMLR estimated that pirate vessels caught more than 3600 tonnes of toothfish and killed more than 8000 seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, New Zealand inspectors documented that the Namibian-flagged &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/0/vessel/show/156-paloma-v"&gt;Paloma V&lt;/a&gt; had been involved in &lt;a href="http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Features/945-Illegal-Fishing-activities.php"&gt; illegal transshipments&lt;/a&gt;. It was blacklisted by CCAMLR as a result. The inspection revealed that the vessel was operating together with other ships in the Vidal fleet including the blacklisted North Korean-flagged Chilbo San 33 and Black Moon, as well as the Spanish-flagged Belma and Galaecia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Spain signed an agreement with Namibia in 2008 that gave the Belma access to Namibian fishing grounds, and has provided Vidal Armadores with other assistance in securing contracts and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hook them and book them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on all countries participating in the Committee on Fisheries in Rome to take the evidence presented to them seriously and urgently work towards closing the loopholes that these operators use to avoid controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is not alone - fishing companies around the world use transshipments and loopholes to evade the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need bodies like the UN FAO to support strong regulations involving the ports that these ships enter, create a global record of fishing vessels and to urgently reduce commercial fishing to a sustainable level. It is simply a matter of political will to deliver the kind of enforcement that is needed to protect the marine environment and the communities which depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the case of Vidal Armadores, we want to see the Spanish government take real action to stop ocean plunder - they can start by asking for their subsidies back. Then they can prosecute any Spanish nationals that were captains or masters of the ships. Then they can revoke all Vidal Armadores' licenses and stop helping them get contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves to protect the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Stop nuclear madness, end MOX shipments now </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/stop-nuclear-madness-no-more/</url><text>
	The largest shipment of deadly plutonium in history is about to leave the French port of Cherbourg - final destination Japan. We’ve taken action to send the message that this is yet another glaring example of the unacceptable risks posed by nuclear energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A target symbol projected onto a truck loaded with plutonium in MOX fuel. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists in France have tracked the shipment which contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in Mixed-Oxide (MOX) fuel. This is enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated &lt;a href="http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/na-bomb/museum/museume01.html"&gt; Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've demonstrated with distress flares and "Stop Plutonium" banners at the Cherbourg port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We projected a "target" symbol and "Nuclear Madness made in France" onto the nearby state owned AREVA reprocessing plant in La Hague, where the MOX was produced. Our activists also projected the same messages onto the trucks carrying the deadly cargo to Cherbourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our position is simple. The world needs an immediate ban on MOX shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ships, the Pacific Heron and Pacific Pintail will be used to transport the radioactive cargo. They will leave on March 6, just after departure AREVA will reveal which route the deadly waste will take to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mox - a deadly fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest dangers of plutonium is that it can be used to make nuclear weapons. MOX increases the dangers of nuclear proliferation, as the plutonium in it is easier to extract for weapons use than plutonium in spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also plenty of evidence showing that the containers used to transport the MOX are not strong enough to withstand serious accidents or terrorist attack. Risk of fire is just one example, the containers are only tested over a few hours, but fires on board ships can last much longer (days or even weeks).  Once MOX fuel disperses it poses a grave threat to public health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a plutonium shipment in 2002, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda stated "our small states are fearful that a deliberate act of terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence. This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all this, it is little wonder that plutonium and MOX shipments have been opposed by dozens of governments and their citizens, since they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AREVA is denying the risks of proliferation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AREVA denies that there is any proliferation risk by claiming a false distinction between "military grade" and "civil grade" nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) thinks differently classifying commercial plutonium MOX fuel as Category 1 nuclear material, requiring the highest level of security protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the world now has more weapons usable plutonium in civil nuclear programmes than in all nuclear weapons arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the Japan's Citizens Nuclear Information Center and Green Action organisations we've &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/Open-letter-ElBaradei"&gt; written to Mohammed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, head of the IAEA warning him that AREVA is either dangerously confused, or is deliberately misrepresenting the proliferation threat posed by the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also sent &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/open-letter-en-route-countries/"&gt; letters to the governments&lt;/a&gt; of  countries that may be en route, warning them of the potential dangers to their populations and environment; and urging them to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/3/mox-map-route.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25048/moxmap-thumb.jpg" alt="moxmap.jpg" width="430" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The most likely route of the MOX shipment is via South Africa and across the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia, and through the coastal waters of South Pacific nations. Other possible routes are via the Caribbean and Panama Canal or via South America and Cape Horn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan has been failing to use MOX for their nuclear reactors for over a decade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has been trying to use MOX in their nuclear reactors for more than ten years; and have repeatedly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shipment to Japan in 1999 ended in fiasco after the producer, UK state company British Nuclear Fuels, admitted it had deliberately falsified vital quality control safety data. After an 18,000-mile voyage, the rejected fuel was shipped back to the UK. Two more cargoes, one delivered in 1999, the other in 2001, were opposed by local citizens and regional governments. Both shipments remain in storage with no prospect that they will ever be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough already, stop the Nuclear madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as though anything has changed. Shipping MOX remains as dangerous as ever. Governments across the world have recognised the threat and in 2005 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/MIM/A-conf.207-L.6-Mauritius%20Declaration.pdf"&gt; a moratorium on all nuclear transports&lt;/a&gt; was tabled at a UN summit. It's time to make that resolution a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the best efforts of the nuclear industry to convince us otherwise, the simple truth is that you can't separate "civil" nuclear from nuclear used for weapons. They are two parts of the same extremely dangerous whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for industry claims that nuclear power can be used in the fight against climate change, the opposite is true. Nuclear power is too little, too late, too dangerous. In fact, it &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25048/nuclear-power-undermining-cl.pdf"&gt; undermines the true solutions to climate change&lt;/a&gt; by diverting urgently needed resources away from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory in Greece as the Quit Coal campaign moves to Indonesia</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory_greece_quit_coal_indonesia_120209/</url><text>
	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>France's Nuclear Failures</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/frances-nuclear-failures-020209/</url><text>
	Hazardous waste, illegitimate and dangerous new reactors and a diversion to the solutions to climate change - here's why France's picture of nuclear energy is just a 'great illusion'.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace in action at the construction site of the European Pressurised Reactor in Flamanville, France. Greenpeace is demanding an immediate end to construction at both Flamanville and Europe's other EPR site at Olkiluoto, Finland, calling the plants dangerous, unnecessary and uneconomic.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the French government's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) as cheap and safe, nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity, and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever-increasing problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has recently uncovered evidence that nuclear waste from the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) - the flagship of the French nuclear industry - will be up to &lt;strong&gt;seven times more hazardous&lt;/strong&gt; than waste produced by existing nuclear reactors, increasing costs and the danger to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming evidence was buried away in the &lt;a href="http://www.posiva.fi/publications/Posiva_YVA_selostusraportti_en_lukittu.pdf"&gt; environmental impact assessment report&lt;/a&gt; from Posiva, the company responsible for managing waste at the world's first EPR under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland, and in &lt;a href="http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e_ntb04-08.pdf"&gt; EU-funded research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expensive and hazardous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR is designed to extract more energy from nuclear fuel than any commercially operating reactor in order to maximise electricity output. This "high burn-up" method causes the amount of readily-released radioactive substances in spent fuel to increase disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of the hazardous waste will be more costly for a range of reasons - including an increase in the repository size due to the greater distance needed between canisters, more extensive and longer-term monitoring being necessary, and increased security being required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…not only will spent nuclear fuel produced by the EPR be more dangerous than is acknowledged by the French nuclear industry, but also storage and disposal will be more expensive than the industry and governments proclaim and will increase the overall cost of nuclear energy. The French nuclear companies Areva and EDF, which aggressively market the EPR as safe and cheap, have completely ignored the implications of the increased &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;hazards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Large, independent nuclear consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No appropriate waste facilities exist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- or are even being planned - in Finland, France or any of the countries considering buying the EPR (including the UK, the US, Canada and India). In Finland, plans for burying the nuclear waste that are awaiting approval are simply inadequate for preventing interim and long-term health risks, and will pass on huge financial liabilities to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Illegitimate and dangerous"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR construction project in Olkiluoto has been &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-the-french-reactor/"&gt; hampered by all manner of chronic problems, delays and cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposed to have been completed by April 2009, but now faces at least three years' delay - its cost has doubled to over €5 billion and serious construction and safety problems have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same mistakes have plagued a second EPR construction at Flamanville, France, which started just over a year ago. It too is now delayed - by nine months at present - and is already running at over 20 percent of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, President Sarkozy &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/illegitimate-and-dangerous-reactor-300109/"&gt; announced last week that a new EPR is to be built in Penly&lt;/a&gt;, France. Greenpeace believes that building yet another reactor under these circumstances is entirely illegitimate and simply dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penly decision was taken without any public consultation, open bidding or analysis of energy needs. No other options, such as energy efficiency or renewable energy potential, were considered, no comparisons were made in terms of costs, environmental impacts or needs; in fact, the official study analysing France's electricity needs beyond 2020 is still ongoing, so there is nothing to justify the decision to pour vast amounts of money into building another problematic reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its only justification is to provide a massive contract to the state-owned industry. In these times of fiscal crisis, however, it is crucial to make the right choices: and investment instead in renewable energy would provide not only climate protection and cleaner energy, but more and better jobs and a truly sustainable state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The great illusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when France is setting itself up as the political and industrial champion of a supposed worldwide expansion of nuclear power, Global Chance - an  association that includes among its members several of France's few independent nuclear experts - has produced a report that shows how France's nuclear promises are a dangerous illusion. France is locked into nuclear power in a way that presents an obstacle to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Chance report shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France's nuclear programme fails to rise to the challenges of climate change and energy security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France has not benefited economically from their 'all electric, all nuclear' approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how nuclear power is liable to suffer serious accidents - whether due to system failure, natural disaster or deliberate attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how no satisfactory solution has been found for the management of long-term waste; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France contributes to proliferation, which remains a major risk for global security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace briefing &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/frances-nuclear-failures-report/"&gt; &lt;em&gt;France's Nuclear Failures - The great illusion of nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; summarises the lessons that can be drawn from the Global Chance report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy [R]evolution!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is nothing more than an out-of-date, expensive and failed technology from the last century. It undermines the solutions to climate change by diverting urgently-needed resources away from the true renewable and energy-efficiency solutions that governments who are serious about climate change need to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy [R]evolution blueprint&lt;/a&gt; shows that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency can deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050 and ensure that people have a clean energy future that is free from the dangers of hazardous nuclear waste.&lt;/p&gt;

	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;For the sake of biodiversity, indigenous peoples' rights and the climate, I support Greenpeace's call to cut emissions – not trees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept funds from governments or corporations, but we've been able to support projects like this thanks to individual donations from people like you. Please give what you can to keep Greenpeace Amazon in action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Undercover operation exposes illegal dumping of e-waste in Nigeria </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-nigeria180209/</url><text>
	Following a three-year undercover investigation, we’ve shown once again that electronic waste - like your old TV set - still isn't being responsibly recycled like it's supposed to be. Instead, e-waste is being disguised as second-hand goods and shipped off to Nigeria, where it is sold, scrapped or illegally dumped. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            E-waste is one of the fastest growing types of hazardous waste with up to 80 percent of e-waste from Europe failing to be disposed of safely
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover operation, carried out with the help of &lt;a title="Sky News" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Sky-Probe-Reveals-Recycling-Scandal-As-Broken-TVs-Are-Shipped-Over-To-West-Africa/Article/200902315224628?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15224628_Sky_Probe_Reveals_Recycling_Scandal_As_Broken_TVs_Are_Shipped_Over_To_West_Africa"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt;, is further evidence of the growing trade in hazardous waste from Europe to the developing world due to  electronic companies' failure to take responsibility for recycling their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on a tip-off, we launched our operation to see just where some electronic waste was ending up. We took an unfixable TV, fitted it with a tracking device and brought it to the UK's Hampshire County Council for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being safely dismantled in the UK or Europe, like it should have been, the Council's 'recycling' company, BJ Electronics, passed it on as 'second-hand goods' and it was shipped off to Nigeria to be sold or scrapped and dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following the e-waste trail - a Greenpeace investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's illegal to export broken electronic goods under EU legislation - at no point before it was crammed into a container with similar TVs and shipped off was the TV turned on or tested to see if it was in working condition. We followed the complete e-waste trafficking route by hiding a tracking device inside the TV that provided location updates via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/02/illegal_ewaste_export_to_niger.html"&gt; Read more&lt;/a&gt; about how exactly we tracked the TV all the way to Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, like &lt;a title="Ghana" href="/international/en/news/features/poisoning-the-poor-electroni/"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Pakistan" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/scrap-life-pakistan-with-rob"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="India" href="/international/en/publications/reports/recyclingelectronicwasteindiachinafull/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="China" href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-e-waste-exposed140708/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, is just one of many destinations that Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other developed countries are using as toxic e-waste dumping grounds. For years, we've been exposing the mountains of e-waste that show up on the doorstep of developing countries at the expense of people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest people, in many cases children, are put to work breaking apart TVs, mobile phones, game consoles and other electronic items that arrive in their tonnes. With no safety measures, they are exposed to highly toxic chemicals, including mercury, which damages the brain; lead, which can damage reproductive systems; and cadmium, which causes kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is your e-waste going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we were able to track the e-waste from door to door, exposing the loopholes in recycling programmes that allow illicit profits to be made by the developed world's traders by dumping their obsolete and hazardous electronics abroad instead of properly recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of old electronic goods and components leave the EU for Africa every day, despite regulations prohibiting the trade in e-waste. Some will be repaired and reused, but many are beyond repair, meaning that they will eventually be dumped in places where no facilities exist for safe recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by making sure their goods are free from hazardous components. We need them to take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that poison people and the environment across the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need companies to introduce voluntary take-back schemes and remove hazardous substances from their products so they can be recycled safely and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing evidence of the harm caused by toxic e-waste, many companies are still failing to prioritise the removal of toxic chemicals and delaying taking full responsibility for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="The Independent" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/dumped-in-africa-britain8217s-toxic-waste-1624869.html"&gt;Check out the&lt;/a&gt; coverage of the undercover investigation at The Independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Please join us and tell Philips now to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;This undercover investigation would not be possible without your support. Please give what you can to make sure that we can continue to investigate the crimes that threaten the planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>First fin whales killed in Iceland </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/first-fin-whales-killed-in-ice/</url><text>
	The whaling boat Hvalur 9 dragged two massive fin whales up to the ancient whaling station ramp at Hvalförður in the early hours. If it were not for Iceland’s midnight sun the whalers would have been sneaking in under the cover of the night – a scene befitting the shameful hunt that can only do untold damage to Iceland’s reputation.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            June 19, 2009 HVALFJORDUR-FJORD, ICELANDWhaling in Iceland. First fin whales brought to land on June 19, 2009. The boat, Hvalur 9, entering Hvalfjordur-fjord. The first fin whale to be cut was a female, 18 metres long.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales were killed on Friday morning, just days before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings begin in Madeira, Portugal. The start of the hunt was clearly intended to deride efforts to modernise the Commission and stop the needless slaughter of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales are the first of 150 fin whales Icelandic whaler Kristjan Loftsson plans to hunt this year, despite having no domestic market for the meat and &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/no-market-for-icelandic-whale/"&gt; no interest from importers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The hunt is part of a 5 year whaling programme agreed by the former Icelandic government, just hours before it collapsed earlier this year. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists fin whales as an endangered species globally that requires special protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland's new government "fallen asleep" on the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland's new government under Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir has openly voiced its opposition to whaling. Yet, by failing to stop the hunt it appears to have fallen asleep on the issue and allowed the whalers to dictate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has not only failed to stop the controversial fin whale hunt from going ahead. It is also failing to stop a hunt of minke whales that started in May. Shockingly, the minkes are being hunted in the same areas as those visited by whale watching trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not taking action to stop the hunts, the new government risks squandering a real chance to save Iceland's environmental and international reputation, as well as hopes for speedy accession to the pro-conservation Europe Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No market for whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no domestic whale meat market in Iceland. Loftsson justifies the hunt by promising to sell the meat to Japan, claiming it can help Iceland recover from its economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently showed that this is absolute hogwash, when we released audio and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fact-sheet-the-whale-meat-mar/"&gt; an English transcript&lt;/a&gt; of a very interesting conversation we had with the Japanese trader who imported fin and minke whale meat from Iceland and Norway last year. The head of the Asia Trading Company in Tokyo told us very clearly that he will not take any more in the future, because there is no market for the whale meat in Japan. In fact, he only took it last year as a favour to Loftsson because he is a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland hunt starts on eve of IWC meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fin whale hunt has started just before the IWC meets in Madeira, Portugal. The blatant disregard displayed by the Icelandic whalers for international agreements, economics and the environment is a prime example of why the IWC needs to put its own house in order and become an effective conservation body that works for whales, not whalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a perfect setting for such change. In 1981, Portugal moved to protect all whales and dolphins throughout its territories, ending the island's long association with whaling. Madeira's fast-growing whale watching industry proves once again that whales are worth much more alive than dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icleand is well positioned to follow this example. More than 115,000 people have already taken our Iceland Pledge, saying they would visit the country, and go whale watching, if the government ends whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/d65e0c9134ba47f382c627f685a3589f.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Tell Iceland's government to save the whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Help keep us fighting for whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>A Time Comes: What it means to take action</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/louder-than-words020609/</url><text>
	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a sustainable future is only as strong as the people who support us. Join us today and add your voice to a movement that's committed to defending our food and planet. Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace – Yes Men spoof newspaper declares climate deal </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iht-se/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and demanding solutions. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Climate challenge even greater after UN meeting in Bonn</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bonntwo150609/</url><text>
	As another round of Bonn climate talks limps to a close, and the UN Climate Summit to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December this year draws closer and closer, it’s a good opportunity to take a look at the progress that’s been made so far…
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-activists-activated.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Negotiators at the UN climate talks in Bonn failed to answer the call for emergency action on climate change. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, almost everything is now on the table. On the minus side, almost everything now on the table is still on the table, and doesn't look likely to be going anywhere fast. In fact, one draft document that was 50 pages long at the start of the Bonn meeting is now closer to 300 pages long. Given that one of the purposes of this meeting was to narrow options down, it's safe to assume that 'progress', therefore, has not been significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money from the industrialised world to help developing countries to switch to clean energy, keep tropical rainforests intact and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts is still missing from the table. But the biggest space of all is where the robust, effective emissions cuts for industrialised countries should be. The science demands that, as a group, these countries need to cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of irreversible climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaders need apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate change issue has to be passed right to the top of the political 'food chain'. Heads of governments must take responsibility for protecting the climate and, in so doing, protecting the planet and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. There's probably not a single ministry or government department that remains untouched by this issue; energy, environment, foreign affairs, treasury - the list goes on. And every single one of them will have its own perspectives and priorities. In every capital city around the world, the person who has the 'big picture' - the person who sits at the desk where the buck ultimately stops - needs to stand up, step up and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next chance for action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, the heads of the world's richest countries will get together in Italy for the G8 Summit. This will be an historical opportunity for these leaders to break the deadlock and send a strong signal of intent by agreeing deep cuts in emissions and putting money on the table for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December around 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Justice for the Tokyo Two - justice for whales, coming our way?</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/justice-for-the-tokyo-two-ju/</url><text>
	Justice is starting to go the Tokyo Two way: A court in Aomori, Japan, has delivered a series of setbacks to the prosecution in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki (the activists known as the Tokyo Two) - and the Japanese government's attempts to cover up an embezzlement scandal within the whaling industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/greenpeace-campaigns-director.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan Campaigns Director Junichi Sato faces up to ten years in prison for exposing corruption in the whaling industry.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the court has ruled that evidence of the embezzlement scandal cannot be excluded. Second, the issue of whether or not Junichi and Toru's actions are protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can and will be discussed during the trial. Third, the court has requested that the prosecutor come forward with witness testimonies that may prove crucial to the case - and to further disclose evidence of the whale meat scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor had previously been attempting to portray the actions of Junichi and Toru as being a simple case of theft, and to block any discussion of the embezzlement. The court has rightly refused to accept this, ruling that this evidence cannot be excluded - evidence which details the exposure by Junichi and Toru of a major corruption scandal within the Japanese government-sponsored Southern Ocean whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru risk up to ten years in jail if convicted of theft. They removed a box of embezzled whale meat from a mail depot last year, and presented it to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor, who immediately opened up an investigation into corruption in the government-subsidised whaling programme. The investigation was later discontinued - on the same day that Junichi and Toru were arrested, and the Greenpeace Japan office raided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has urged the prosecutor to disclose evidence that he's been holding back. This includes statements made to police by the "owner" of the intercepted box of whale meat;  by several individuals who purportedly entrusted their whale meat to him, and by an employee of whaling fleet operator Kyodo Senpaku, who made the arrangements to transport the crewmembers' "personal luggage" from the ship to their homes. If that sounds murky, it's probably because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this trial, we want to establish that what Junichi and Toru did was to corroborate information provided by whistleblowers regarding embezzlement within the Kyodo Senpaku whaling fleet," said the Tokyo Two's defence lawyer, Yuichi Kaido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the prosecutor's opinion being rejected by the court, we have gained a foothold in this case and the opportunity to prove that there was indeed embezzlement of whale meat by employees."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that prosecutor's attempts to keep the whale meat scandal and several witnesses out of the courtroom, and thus the public eye, has only resulted in making the judges more curious. Maybe it's because the prosecutor knows that the whaling industry really has something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The government was hoping to bury this scandal by putting the messengers on trial," said Jun Hoshikawa, Greenpeace Japan Executive Director. "However, as more evidence of embezzlement comes to light, at the end of the day it will be whaling that is on trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;If the Japanese government is going to arrest people for the crime of opposing whaling, they are going to need a lot of handcuffs.  Are you a suspect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Help us defend the Tokyo Two, and oppose whaling.  Greenpeace accepts no money from governments or corporations. We rely on you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The campaign that launched 1000 geeks</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/the-campaign-that-launched-100/</url><text>
	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to campaign for a green and peaceful future. You will make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A new exhibit in Aomori, Japan, gives a glimpse of Greenpeace history through one of our iconic communication tools: the t-shirt.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mai Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan and Fanny Lee of Greenpeace China at exhibition of Greenpeace t-shirts in Aomori, Japan, where two Greenpeace activists are on trial.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our campaigns have spawned many, many tees -- from the funny to the shrill, the plain and functional to the artistic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as action tools, as when activists aboard the Greenpeace ship Sirius were being escorted out of the Soviet Union, and in front of whirring cameras revealed the message "Stop Nuclear Testing" in Russian on the t-shirts  beneath their sweatshirts.  Or when activists in the high-security zone around a Star Wars missile test wore "Don't Shoot" tees -- messaging both the missile masters and the gun-toting guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been used as barter items with border guards, coveted and swapped among ships' crew, and sought after by collectors looking to create a complete timeline of the organisation in organic cotton. When our Japanese office put out the call to Greenpeacers around the world to empty their closets, they got nearly 200 examples of the art of the body billboard from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organiser Mai Suzuki, activist and Greenpeace t-shirt collector, hopes to tell the public about environmental risks and Greenpeace's efforts to tackle them in a simple and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many of us wear T-shirts every day. When you wear a Greenpeace T-Shirt, everyone can look at you on the street. It is a potent and direct way of communicating information," said Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
&lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2Fshow%2F&amp;amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fgpjphoto%2Fsets%2F72157619186149933%2F&amp;amp;set_id=72157619186149933&amp;amp;jump_to="&gt;
&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition also highlights the global support behind the Aomori communications centre, which was set up earlier this year to bring Greenpeace messages directly to people of the port city. Aomori is where Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are currently on trial for intercepting a box of embezzled whale meat, with the aim of exposing a long-standing culture of embezzlement within the government-sponsored whaling programme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They succeeded in exposing the scandal, but are now on trial themselves for "theft", despite having given the whale meat to the public prosecutor as evidence for an investigation into the embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition showcases a new t-shirt from Greenpeace UK, which was recently worn by activists during activities supporting Junichi and Tory, known as the "Tokyo Two", in London.  (Nudge, nudge -- you can &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;buy a version of that t-shirt at our online shop&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki hopes that the T-Shirts will show the Japanese public the passion Greenpeace has for its campaigns, and that it inspires them to take action themselves to right environmental wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is my wish that the public come and take a look at the T-Shirts, and realise that they have the power to change the world," said Suzuki.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/greenpeace"&gt;When you buy a Greenpeace t-shirt, the proceeds help keep us going. When you wear a Greenpeace t-shirt, you help spread the word about our campaigns. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/support-us"&gt;T-shirts alone can't keep our ships at sea and our activists free.  Please donate whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Amazon destruction not such a good look </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/slaughteringtheamazon-160609/</url><text>
	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl01_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/a-rancher-on-horse-guides-his.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State

<item><language>en</language><title>Mr. Potato Head goes organic</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mr-potato-head-organic210509/</url><text>
	Giant potatoes have been spotted riding bikes in the Dutch countryside and through the middle of busy cities in the Netherlands! This phenomenon has coincided with a nation-wide cycling celebration of organic farming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            They say "potato" - we say "not the genetically modified ones" Oh let's call the whole thing off!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pieperpad.nl/"&gt;PieperPad&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch for "Potato Trail") is a 1000 kilometer long cycling tour designed to raise awareness about the importance of ecological farming in the Netherlands by encouraging members of the public to get out into the countryside and enjoy potatoes, a well loved Dutch staple, in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Parliament, called Mr. Pieper (yes, he's actually called "Mr. Potato"!) was a special guest at the premiere of the first track along with Gert van der Zwan, principal of the Carolus Clusius College (Carolus Clusius is the botanist who brought the potato to Holland around 1600). Copies of the cycling guide were given to these two sensibly dressed fellows who then donned potato costumes, hopped on their bike and rode to the first potato exhibition field sporting 15 kinds of potatoes. Assisted by students of the Carolus Clusius College, the two special guests planted the last potatoes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pieperpad is an initiative by Greenpeace Netherlands together with Biologica.Both organisations defend biodiversity and campaign on environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On yer bike!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several Dutch cities the Pieperpad was promoted by volunteers handing out potatoes, flyers and riding around on bikes dressed as potatoes - through the centre of Utrecht and organic markets in Amsterdam and Amerongen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch folks have been very enthusiastic about the project and requests are flooding in from individuals and businesses who want to hop on the Pieperpad. Greenpeace Netherlands has also started a competition asking supporters to create a name for the newest organic potato that will be ready at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25017/the-pieperpad-dutch-for-pota-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organic revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked several organic farmers here in the Netherlands how they felt about going organic. J. Bakker, grows potatoes on his 80 hectare farm, in Munnekezijl. Mr. Bakker was a conventional farmer for 25 years, but in 2001 he decided to switch to organic farming. He says "Genetic engineering is the biggest threat to agriculture, because there is so much uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joute Miedema, in Oudebildtzijl, went completely organic in 2009. From 1967 till 2000 he worked as a conventional farmer. But when he realised that organic farming was economical feasible he decided to make the gradual switch to organic farming. He enjoys being an organic farmer a lot more. "It demands more creativity and alertness", says Miedema. "Marketwise it's more pioneering and I like it more and more." Because he uses organic fertilisers in stead of artificial ones, his soil gets more body and life returns to his acres. "Birds of prey have returned, just like hares, deer, quails, while they have been away for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Ploer runs a farm with his family in the same region. When they first started working there he wanted to work in a way that was friendly to both humans, animals and the environment, that's why he decided to work organically. "Organic is the kind of farming I feel most at home with. In agriculture everything has to do with everything. You feed the soil, work together with the animals and for humans. Organic farmers make the right moves: No poison, rejecting genetically modified crops and no artificial fertilisers. Physical and mental health go first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GM resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries continue to resist growing genetically modified (GM) crops. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/germany-bans-monsanto-s-maize/"&gt; Germany has just announced that it will become the sixth EUcountry to ban the cultivation of Monsanto's GM maize MON810&lt;/a&gt; - the only GM crop that can be commercially grown inthe region. But Monsanto is still pushing for this maize to be grown in more EU countries, with some worrying success. The EU Commission needs to take a stand against GM crops to ensure the protection of consumers, farmers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another bid to control our food, &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/bayer/"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant&lt;/a&gt;is hoping to get EU approval for the import of their GM rice varietyLL62. This rice has geneticallymanipulated rice to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide calledglufosinate,which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environmentthat it will soon be banned from Europe. If this rice gets approval - farmers in the US and elsewhere may soon startplanting the manipulated crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that governments around the world will follow the examples of countries like Germany and France by announcing a ban all GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/hands-off-our-rice?homebanner"&gt;Ask all governments around the world to protect consumers and farmers, their crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE rice, and stopping GE rice field trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish Prime Minister takes step towards EU leadership at UN Climate Summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/TuskCopenhagen04062009/</url><text>
	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object width="400" height="230" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4910404&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

	If saving our climate was a game of poker and all the various stakeholders - our heads of state, the energy industry, environmentalists, etc - were players, there would be one player at the table who hasn't yet shown their cards. The hold-out in this particular game is the Information Technology (IT) Industry, a player who is sitting on a lot of chips in a high stakes game, despite holding a winning hand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cool-it-challenge-cards.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! Sun Microsystems, Intel, Fujitsu, Cisco? Who will be the first to rise to the Cool IT Challenge?
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry has already boasted about its potential contributions to cutting carbon emissions: more than &lt;a href="http://www.smart2020.org/"&gt;15 percent by 2020&lt;/a&gt; - globally. To put that in perspective the emissions cuts needed globally to avoid the worst consequences of climate change are at least &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/demands-for-the-copenhagen-cli/"&gt; 50 percent by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, making the IT Industry no small-time player in determining the fate of our climate - better yet, our entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the IT industry holding back? They stand to gain huge profits, and they can win global love and admiration by developing and offering technology solutions to cutting global emissions.  They ought to be lobbying hard for the tough restrictions that will put their services in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments around the world debate climate policies the IT industry is playing its cards close to its chest instead of advocating for science-based greenhouse gas emissions cuts. This is no way to play the game! They should be betting big, not getting ready to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show us your hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes a hold-out. So, we're talking to you Nokia, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Fujistu. You too - Sharp, IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba. And don't think you're getting off easy either Microsoft and Sony. It's time for your CEOs to lay their cards on the table. This includes: not only providing IT climate solutions, but also accurate measurements of the positive impact those solutions will have overall. Using your influence to lobby for a deal at the upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year, which will increase demand for IT climate solutions by the rest of the economy. Taking steps to reduce your own emissions and increasing your use of renewable energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get on with it! - you say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will push the IT Industry to lay its cards on the table? Greenpeace? Nope. Techies. Techies are the IT Industry's main constituency: they are its employees, customers and fans, and when they collectively demand climate leadership, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; greener gadgets, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;d futuristic, awe-inspiring IT climate solutions from the CEOs of major IT corporations the industry will sit up and take notice. That is why the Cool IT Challenge is running on techie power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it-challenge/about/faq#scores_table"&gt; scored&lt;/a&gt; the CEOs of all the major IT corporations mentioned above on their climate leadership and is now inviting techies, as well as activists and concerned citizens, to &lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; place their bets&lt;/a&gt; on the CEOs most likely to improve their scores. Their performance will be monitored closely in the lead up to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, as this summit presents an opportunity for the IT Industry to really lay down their cards and use their influence to push for a positive outcome at the climate negotiations taking place there. Greenpeace will regularly reevaluate the CEOs performance, update their scores accordingly and allow Cool IT Challenge bets to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT Industry is holding winning cards when it comes to our climate: influence, innovation and potential - tell them to pony up. There is too much at stake for them to fail to rise to this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Place your bets!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/9ad1737fd0b345ee91c50872f77deabf.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Join techies, activists and concerned citizens everywhere! Place your bets and your pressure on the IT Industry and demand climate leadership today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

	Two years have passed since world leaders promised all of us a deal to stop climate change. After two weeks of UN negotiations, politicians breezed in, had dinner with the Queen, a three hour lunch, took some photos and then delivered what could only be described as the 24 hour Head of State tourist brochure of Copenhagen instead of a climate treaty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Think or Swim!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't believe the hype, there is nothing fair, ambitious or legally binding about this deal. The job of world leaders is not done. Today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/PageFiles/24942/cop15-assessment.pdf"&gt;Click here for a detailed assessment of the Copenhagen Accord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Copenhagen is a climate crime scene tonight, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame. World leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good, to avert catastrophic climate change. What we needed was a legally binding agreement that was fair to developing countries and ambitious when it came to emissions cuts and ending deforestation. In the end they produced a poor deal full of loopholes big enough to fly Air Force One through. We've seen a year of crises, but today it is clear that the biggest one facing humanity is a leadership crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's to blame?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year, a number of developing countries showed a willingness to accept their share of the burden to avert climate chaos. But in the end, the blame for failure mostly lies with the rich industrialised world, countries which have the largest historic responsibility for causing the problem. In particular, the US failed to take any real leadership and dragged the talks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are saying that we have only a few years left to stop the rise in emissions before making the kind of rapid reductions that would give us the best chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. We cannot change that science, so instead we will have to change the politics - and we may well have to change the politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen million people demanded that world leaders take responsibility and make good on their promise to deliver a real deal to save the climate. World leaders clearly heard us - echoing our messages in many of their own speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not over, people everywhere demanded a real deal before the Summit began and they are still demanding it. We can still save hundreds of millions of people from the devastation of a warming world, but it has just become a whole lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Executive Director and chair of the tcktcktck coalition, Kumi Naidoo said "Civil society, the bulk of which was locked out of the final days of this Climate Summit, now needs to redouble its efforts. Each and every one of us must hold our leaders to account. We must take the struggle to avert climate catastrophe into every level of politics, local, regional, national and international. We also need to take it into the board room and onto the high streets. We can either work for a fundamental change in our society or we can suffer the consequences of one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Messages to, from the future</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/messages-to-the-future/</url><text>
	Over the past month, thousands of people have posted messages to our Love Letters to the Future web site. They have voted for each other's love letters and shared their favourites with friends on Facebook.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/12/time-capsule.gif" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A schematic drawing of the time capsule.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- a#rollover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-example.gif); width:430px; height:297px; display:block; }a#rollover span { display:none; }a#rollover:hover { background-image:url(http://static.greenpeace.org/int/images/graphics/love-letters/love-letters-maya.gif); } --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the top 100 letters are being sealed in a time capsule, along with a selection of objects related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule will be sealed at the Store Vega nightclub in Copenhagen by Danish actor Thure Lindhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'climate hero' will bring a special message of support from the people of China. Live music will be provided by Nabiha, plus DJs Flow Job and Dokkedal/Dixon - if you're in Copenhagen, doors open at 8PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the messages in the time capsule at the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best messages so far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f64fa27b-bc79-4817-99dc-02d1a2f0760f"&gt; Is my city still there?&lt;/a&gt;", Hanna, Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=ff66a9f1-6fbc-4901-a698-9d245d0e9e3d"&gt; Alien Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;", Cory Doctorow, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f1b9216e-b7a0-4d5a-ab85-c2fea13b002e"&gt; It took a long time to understand&lt;/a&gt;", Carla, Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=f79f5906-c9f7-4e57-9a96-5df09b2e94a1"&gt; Love and tranquillity&lt;/a&gt;", Ana-Maria, Romania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fcd0441a-a4cd-4f6c-979c-b4e40a26e293"&gt; Sorry for the mess&lt;/a&gt;", Mark, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/?media=fba8333c-89c4-46b9-9b26-2fbd65dd8c9f"&gt; Forest berries&lt;/a&gt;", Marie, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time capsule is shockproof, waterproof and designed to last above ground for 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages selected for the time capsule will be encoded using Monolith™ card technology, that transforms data into a two-dimensional barcode that is burnt into the card. Besides the digital barcode, the film also holds preview images and metadata containing technical, self-explaining information about the read-back procedure. So even if language or technology changes the data will be recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional software or hardware necessary to read the cards, which makes this form of data storage independent of technological changes. Each card (10x15cm) can support a resolution of up to 300 pairs of lines per millimeter, carrying up to 120MB worth of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base of the time capsule is made out of an oil barrel that contains two sections inside: the bottom part is the 'hard core' preservation area, where we store the love letters for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our own favorite messages and engraved them on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="rollover" href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;A sample love letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Objects in the time capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the time capsule are vacuumed packed, and individually sealed to aid in their preservation.   Each was chosen for its connection to climate change, and personal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medal from a Netherlands canal ice skating race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm hat worn by youth activists as they &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solargeneration/sets/72157622905827410/"&gt; stood vigil&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, and made &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/solargeneration/2009/12/us_embassy_gets_a_wake_up_call.html"&gt; wake up calls&lt;/a&gt; to political delegates.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bottle of champagne - because if we've averted catastrophic climate change, they'll want to celebrate.  And if we haven't, then the wine growing region of France will have suffered, and it might be hard to get a decent bottle of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hand painted statue of an Asian Elephant, created by Dutch artist Wilma Veen for the &lt;a href="http://shop.myastrolife.nl/product_info.php?products_id=224"&gt;Elephant Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An energy efficient lightbulb - so people in the future will know we had the solutions to climate change, and it was only a matter of having the will to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technical problems or something more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all the people who have reported the strange messages, and odd behaviour of the &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Love Letters to the Future&lt;/a&gt; site.  Apparently, certain search terms, such as "me 2109" trigger unexpected behaviour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xenophile.ca/"&gt;Xenophile media&lt;/a&gt;, our partner in this project, is investigating.  Most of the site works fine though, and we think there may be something we can learn from these strange messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;There is still time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock can still be turned back on catastrophic climate change, and &lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;you still have a chance&lt;/a&gt; to get your message to the future in a time capsule.   We've been so touched by the love letters sent so far that we're going to keep collecting messages, and will add them to a time capsule in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send your own message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loveletterstothefuture.com/"&gt;Send your own message to the future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>The World Bank and the Congo Forests</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;REDD future or greenwash?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	On 3d December 2009, just a few days before the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the Rainforest Fundation delivered an open letter to the World Bank criticising its role in the forest sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo  - home to the second largest rainforest in the world.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The World Bank should be funding forest protection - not destruction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Conference represents the best chance of setting up aglobal deal to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation through anadequate REDD&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;mechanism. But international efforts will be wasted if past lessons fromprevious World Bank-led reforms go unheeded. The forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hang in thebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter denounces the failure of Congo's multinational loggingcompanies to adhere to basic standards of legality and transparency whilecontinuing to flout the rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2009, a "legal review" of logging titles in the DRC was completed. The World Bank states on its website that cancelled titles are "now void" and "logging operations had to stop." However, Greenpeace and other civil society groups have evidence that certain companies have continued their operations in violation of national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2009, local women in Equateur province blocked passage of logging trucks of Sodefor, a subsidiary of Congo's largest logging company, the Liechtenstein-based Nordsüdtimber Group, protesting the broken promises of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our exchanges with around 50 representatives from forest-dependent communities around Bumba in Equateur Province on November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; again revealed that local people are systematically being kept in the dark about the fate of their forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 report&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;by the World Bank Inspection Panel found the Bank had over-estimated therevenues of industrial logging in the Congo and had ignored its adverse impactson livelihoods and biodiversity. In the same year a report co-authored by Bankexperts concluded that "there is little evidence that [industrial timberproduction in Africa] has lifted rural populations out of poverty orcontributed in other meaningful ways to local and national development."&lt;a id="_ednref" title="_ednref" name="_ednref" href="#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;The World Bank continues to spearhead forest reform in the DRC, but itsprograms have so far failed to address any of the main problems plaguing thesector: corruption, impunity, and the exploitation of local people, who aredenied even the most basic information about the logging of their forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its Forest CarbonPartnership Facility (FCPF) the Bank is assisting the DRC in preparing for afuture REDD mechanism. Greenpeace fears that precious REDD money will end upsupporting so-called "sustainable forest management" by logging instead offorest protection and community development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World Bank and other donors should help fund alternatives able todeliver results for the forests, the people and the climate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, resourcesshould be re-directed to mapping the forests and their multiple use with theparticipation of local people, setting aside priority areas for protection fromlarge scale commercial activities, and supporting adequate community forestprojects for real sustainable management. Resources are also needed tostrengthen the enforcement capacities of the DRC administration at all levelsin order to bring companies and small-scale loggers under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank stands at acrossroads. It has to date not replied to calls from NGOs to exclude supportfor logging and plantations from REDD. Will it continue business as usual orwill it back solutions that benefitpeople, forests and the climate?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa political advisor and winner of the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;René Ngongo, Greenpeace Africa Political Advisor and civil society activist for 18 years, today received the Right Livelihood Award at the Swedish Parliament for his dedicated, and at times dangerous, work in defending the rights and livelihood of Democratic Republic of Congo's forest communities.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Livelihood Award Foundation recognised Ngongo "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting his award, René said "I humbly receive this honour on behalf of many of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's poor communities for whom the forest is a source of livelihood, a supermarket, a pharmacy and an heirloom. If we do not continue to raise our voices against the destruction of these ancient forests, their future and our very own existence is at stake".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"René Ngongo is a real leader. He has acted to protect the Democratic Republic of the Congo's forests and to protect its people," said Greenpeace International Executive Director &lt;a href="/international/en/about/kumi-naidoo-blog/"&gt; Kumi Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, who was present at the ceremony. "Just days before the beginning of the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit this award signals the critical importance of working to save the world's forests, not only for the people who depend on them, but also for their role in preventing catastrophic climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24946/a-man-illegally-cuts-down-a-tr.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation. Left intact, the tropical rainforests of the Congo, the Amazon, and Inonesia act like a mighty set of planetary lungs, absorbing CO2 from human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forests on the table in Copenhagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Copenhagen, we're demanding the developed nations put real money on the table to protect rainforests. But we're also having to snap at the heels of global institutions which are still funding forest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ngongo put his signature to an &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/congo-world-bank-031209/"&gt; open letter to the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, principal financier of Congolese forest reform, along with Greenpeace, Global Witness and The Rainforest Foundation. The letter exposes the environmental and social chaos caused by multinational timber companies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and criticizes the Bank's role in promoting industrial logging of rainforests in the name of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank needs to promote viable alternatives that benefit the Congolese people and the global climate. The World Bank's position in favour of logging may also influence the climate negotiations under the guise of so-called "sustainable forest management". Instead, efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must on the contrary exclude incentives for more forest destruction, such as industrial logging and conversion of forests into plantations. Agreements in Copenhagen should provide a reliable fund to promote alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars in the forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngongo has dedicated his life to activism. In the midst of raging conflict, he tirelessly pushed for an end to illegal exploitation of his country's natural resources, collecting abundant evidence on timber and mineral extraction under sometimes life-threatening conditions. In 1994, Ngongo founded the Democratic Republic of the Congo's influential environment organisation, OCEAN. Ngongo has been able to build a strong network and momentum for better protection of the world's second largest rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are very proud as René joins a group of leaders who are not afraid to stand up for the best sustainable options for their communities and environment," said Michelle Ndiaye Ntab, Greenpeace Africa Executive Director.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;What's missing in Copenhagen? YOU are! Send an animated message to world leaders with your facebook profile or other picture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;One of the reasons Greenpeace attracts activists like René is our strict policy of no corporate or government funding. Our silence can't be bought.  We rely on people like you to keep us going.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway's capital today. In his own words, this is a "call to action" rather than a recognition of his own accomplishments. So we're hoping he'll act on his promises to confront the global challenges of the 21st century. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Obama needs to take action in Copenhagen - and change the future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping he will confront the greatest one in history - climate change. Our activists are greeting him in Oslo and urging him to show strong leadership when he attends the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Obama's plane landed in Oslo, he was greeted by a massive Greenpeace banner next to the runway that read "Our climate, your decision." As he traveled through the Norwegian capital to City Hall, where the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held, our activists urged him to earn his Nobel Peace Prize by leading the world to a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate treaty in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several messages were waiting for the new Nobel Laureate throughout Oslo: reverse graffiti (made by pressure-washing stencils) reading "You won it, now earn it," "Change the Politics," and "Stop Climate Change" on public structures; an earth-shaped hot air balloon bearing the slogan "Save the Climate;" a "Next Stop: Copenhagen" banner hanging from the Rainbow Warrior (our ship in Oslo's harbour); and a projection on the City Hall itself reminding the President that it's up to him to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/obama-banner-airport.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome and encourge the President's commitment to working for a world free of nuclear weapons, we call on him to to not only address the weapons of war, but tackle the causes of conflict. Unchecked climate change will herald a new era of resource wars, as fresh water, food production and habitable land all become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting catastrophic climate change is about many things, it is about justice, it is about equity and it is about opportunity. But, perhaps today of all days we can recognise that it is about peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr President keep your eyes on the real prize: Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;US climate commitments unambitious - US leadership nonexistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has only agreed to a provisional goal of cutting its greenhouse gas pollution by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. This offer falls dangerously short of the 25-40 percent cut deemed necessary by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists who won the Noble Prize for theirwork on the issue in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American negotiators have been proposing a so-called "implementation agreement" that would have pollution cuts by countries aspire to what is politically feasible at home and only subject to domestic enforcement. This form of agreement will not build the trust and transparency within the international community that is so desperately needed to achieve a planet-saving deal. It also runs contrary to the commitment to global cooperation - the very reason why Obama won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate negotiations can succeed with the help of a true leader. President Obama, emboldened by the recognition of the Nobel Committee, must tell the world he is willing to sign a deal that is ambitious, fair and legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24944/maandagen-den-7e-december-proji.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;What the deal must achieve:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Copenhagen Climate Summit to agree amultilateral, legally binding deal, which must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions cuts of 40 percent by 2020 by industrialised countries, using 1990 levels as the baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 billion USD a year from the industrialised world for developing countries to deal with climate impacts, act on climate change and stop deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end of tropical deforestation by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing countries must reduce their projected emissions growth by 15-30 percent by 2020, with support from industrialised countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="/international/en/publications/reports/success-or-failure-in-copenhagen/"&gt;Read Greenpeace's key briefing on the possibilities for a strong Copenhagen deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 17, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. President,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to give hope more than a voice. As you depart for the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, I feel compelled to express my hope and desire for the role you will play when you join the other heads of state in reaching an agreement to avert catastrophic climate change: the role you must play in keeping hope alive for many millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Name is Kumi Naidoo, I am the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, I also chair the Global Coalition for Climate Action (www.tcktcktck.org) and serve as a co-chair of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (www.whiteband.org). But, most of all, like you, I am a global citizen. I am also a child of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people around the world, I was uplifted during your presidential campaign. I had great hope as I listened to you speak to the perils of global warming, and about the promise of a clean energy economy. I was delighted by the promise that the US would return to multilateral engagement. After so many years of denial and inaction by the Bush Administration, you restored my hope that a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate agreement was possible. My hope that a deal which would banish the specter of catastrophic climate change could be struck. I believed and still believe you could be the leader to ensure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up under apartheid, I learned that it is possible for a leader seeking change to keep hope alive. I also learned that, sooner or later, transformative leaders must make difficult decisions. Tomorrow you will face such a decision. Your choice could change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, no region or nation is immune to the ravages of climate change. Melting glaciers, blazing forests, and acid seas are some of the well-documented ecological impacts of climate change. But too often, we lose sight of the inextricable link between the environment and how real people are affected.  It is now estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly the poor and politically disenfranchised, die every year in our warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, food, and habitable land are becoming scarcer, compounding human suffering and multiplying political tensions. The latest figures suggest that if we don't act now, as many as one billion people will be uprooted by climate impacts by mid-century.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will inevitably lead to insecurity and conflict. Something an already unstable world can ill-afford. Already climate impacts, such as the drying up of Lake Chad, one of the largest inland seas in the world, have exacerbated the tragedy in Darfur, where water scarcity and competition for land have destroyed the lives of millions.  Indeed, climate change arguably constitutes the biggest threat to peace. The costs of inaction will be measured in human lives, and you well know that women and children, as always, will bear the biggest burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor and voiceless will suffer most; they will be hit hardest and fastest. The unfairness of that pains me. They are the least responsible for causing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, you have taken important steps to make up for lost time by enacting policies which will simultaneously limit greenhouse gas pollution and put Americans to work. From afar, it appears that the ambition of these plans has been stifled by powerful fossil fuel and energy corporations. To date, your negotiators have only agreed to a paltry provisional cut in US emissions of 3 percent on 1990 levels by 2020 - dangerously below the 25-40 percent cut the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also failed to put a long-term financial assistance package on the table. Long-term cash injections are desperately needed to allow poor countries to adapt to the climate impacts they are experiencing and will experience. They need money to invest in clean energy sources as they develop their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I feel a responsibility to inform you that this lack of ambition has profoundly discouraged many of the same people who were so energized by your promise of hope and pledges to rejoin the international community in this common struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cling on to hope, because as you have so vividly demonstrated, anything is possible. The prospect of personal leadership at the negotiations allows me to retain some 'audacity of hope' that you will have both the courage and the vision to make history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple political crisis: it is a moral crisis.  I want to continue to believe in you Mr President. I appeal to your humanity - please don't condemn the peoples of low-lying island states and the world's most vulnerable countries to uncertainty.  Do not let them be wiped off the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have given the world hope that we will finally put this crisis behind us. You have the opportunity to turn hope into action and into reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from the most vulnerable states face a clear and present danger, but let us be clear, all of the world's 6.8 billion people will suffer from the consequences of unchecked climate change. They need a leader with the courage and vision to act. I pray and hope you are such a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end by reminding you of something you said often during your campaign. You frequently invoked the powerful words of Martin Luther King: "The fierce urgency of now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, according to the science the urgency of now has become even more fierce. I humbly appeal to you to reject the voices of short-term interest, of political expediency and of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen instead to the call of history. Listen to the voices of those most at threat. Listen to the voices of future generations, of our children and grandchildren. Of your children. Of your grandchildren, as yet unborn. Then, please, take the action that you know is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Democrats pass bogus climate bill</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/waxmanbill-180509/</url><text>
	Greenpeace is calling for renewed leadership from President Obama and Congress following the release of the drastically weakened Waxman-Markey climate and energy bill today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/4/as-senior-diplomats-and-politi.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Waxman-Markey bill is not strong enough despite calls from the public for strong action on climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Climate and Energy Security Act (ACES) was already in need of improvement when first released as a discussion draft in March, and has become worse as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee actively worked to weaken the bill on behalf of fossil fuels industries and other corporate polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the legislation, Greenpeace USA Executive Director Phil Radford issued the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, this bill has been seriously undermined by the lobbying of industries more concerned with profits than the plight of our planet. While science clearly tells us that only dramatic action can prevent global warming and its catastrophic impacts, this bill has fallen prey to political infighting and industry pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot support this bill in its current state. We call on President Obama and leaders in Congress to get back to work and produce a bill, based on science, which presents a clear road map for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transforms our economy with clean, renewable energy technology, generates new green jobs and shows real leadership internationally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions targets miss the mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that the United States and other developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050. But ACES, as it currently stands, only sets a domestic target of approximately 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Even with additional measures elsewhere in the legislation, the US effort would still fall far short of the emissions cuts that climate scientists say are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid emissions reductions in the short-term are critical to avoiding the worst effects of climate change because rising temperatures have already triggered a series of negative feedback loops - such as Arctic melting in the North and raging wildfires in the South - that are accelerating the crisis. With the weak start outlined in this bill, achieving the needed emissions reductions would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polluters to get massive giveaways, federal renewable standards insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it sets out drastically low emissions targets, ACES would give corporate polluters hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of "allowances" - or free pollution credits - rather than making them pay the true costs of their businesses. Worse, a vast array of carbon offsets will also be offered to polluters, allowing them to effectively sidestep the need to make real reductions in their emissions for perhaps as long as the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, ACES would support the creation of a new generation of dirty coal-fired power plants through US $10 billion worth of ratepayer subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), a technology that has not yet been proven or even tested at large scales. You can read more about why CCS is a dangerous distraction that will not mitigate global warming impacts in our report, "False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable electricity standard set forth in the bill is woefully insufficient. It calls for the electricity supply to include just 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and gives states the option to lower that to 12 percent by making up the difference with efficiency measures. This would deliver lower uptake of renewable energy than states are likely to achieve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Our activists could not fight the legal battles they may face without donations from individuals like you. Please give what you can. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	With just 12 days before the critical UN Copenhagen Climate Summit, we are taking direct action again today - blocking one of the world's largest pulp mills, in the heart of Indonesia's rainforests UPDATE: Our last 4 activists occupied one of the cranes for 27 hours in extreme conditions. All activists have now been detained by the police for questioning.

        &lt;p&gt;
            World leaders can stop deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen activists locked down cranes at the giant paper plant's port calling for strong leadership from world leaders to avert climate chaos and to provide funds needed to end tropical deforestation as part of a fair, ambitious and legally binding climate deal at the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is one of the roots of the climate crisis. We are shutting down this plant at the frontline of forest destruction to tell Heads of State that they can - and must - pull us back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. The paper mill is owned by Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP). The parent company, Sinar Mas, is a leading driver of global climate change due to its widespread role in forest destruction. This plant is fed by wood from one of the world's largest peatland forests, on the Kampar Peninsula in Sumatra, which stores up to 2 giga tonnes of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't believe the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to relegate the Copenhagen climate deal to nothing but a political statement and to postpone critical decisions on a legally binding agreement. President Obama and other world leaders cannot be allowed to sabotage a strong outcome in Copenhagen because of their lack of political will. Significant funds are urgently needed to end tropical deforestation in Indonesia and around the world. This must be a central part of any climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper giant APP sells its products on the global market in China, the United States, Europe and Australia and supplies many international brands and distributors with paper products. Customers include Vogue, Kentucky Fried Chicken and designer Marc Jacobs. APP, alongside their main competitor APRIL, are both responsible for destroying rainforests and their carbon-rich peat soil across Indonesia, including the threatened Kampar Peninsula of Sumatra - the location our Climate Defenders Camp. Containing 2 billion tonnes of carbon, the Peninsula is one of the planet's largest natural carbon stores and a key defence against global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspension for peat's sake!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with local communities over the past month to highlight the central role that deforestation plays in driving global climate change. &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/obama-forests-climate121109/"&gt; Our Climate Defenders took action in the area against APRIL on November 12&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, both the camp and the local communities have been under sustained intimidation by the authorities including threats, arrests and deportations. But &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/forests-climate-april241109/"&gt; last week the Indonesian government suspended APRIL from destroying the area further&lt;/a&gt;- pending a review of the company's permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US, mainly as a result of the ongoing destruction of its forests and their peat soils. Globally, a million hectares of forests are destroyed every month. That's an area the size of a football pitch every two seconds -- emitting so much CO2 that deforestation is one ofthe main causes of climate change, responsible for about a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seal the deal with trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/copenhangen-climate-summit/"&gt; UN Copenhagen Climate Summit&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, Heads of State of developed countries must show real leadership and secure a robust climate deal in December that includes a global funding mechanism that will transfer 30 billion euros (US$42 billion) annually from industrialised countries to poor forested countries like Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, with the aim of ending deforestation by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24950/greenpeace-activists-hang-a-ba-7.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal must deliver substantial emissions reductions from deforestation as well as protect wildlife and respect the rights of forest-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also ensure that money does not end up in the hands of those responsible for forest destruction, like those in the logging industry. If world leaders can commit to halting deforestation at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen - they can accomplish one of the quickest but also one of the most cost effective tasks required to prevent runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get Involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

	A few days ago the cargo ship The Happy Ranger left France carrying steam generators intended for the nuclear European Pressurised Reactor under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. As the ship made its way from France to Finland, activists from the Arctic Sunrise boarded the cargo ship and are currently occupying the deck. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transport of large components for a nuclear reactor is yet another example of France exporting its expensive nuclear technology while undermining investments in real solutions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE November 18, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; The Happy Ranger has arrived in Finland with its cargo and our protest camp with eight activists aboard.  Disappointingly, the activists rather than the steam generator have been detained. You can &lt;a href="http://blogi.greenpeace-online.net/category/english/"&gt;check out the hour by hour story of the action, as told by the activists, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French nuclear industry and President Sarkozy are aggressively trying to sell their nuclear reactors all over the world as a climate change solution. However investments in nuclear energy undermine real efforts to tackle climate change by blocking investments in clean, renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Finns were told that accepting a nuclear reactor would mean no need for new fossil fuel plants. But now the same company building the nuclear reactor is planning a new fossil-fueled power station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned Finland against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts. That risk has become a reality, and it's clear nuclear power is no answer to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24952/greenpeace-board-the-cargo-shi.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuclear energy - financial lunacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment in nuclear energy is a risky business. The nuclear industry is in distress, haemorrhaging money into bad investments while desperately seeking government support in order to pay for it. Finland proves the risk of taking the nuclear energy route: Construction of the French EPR reactor is already three years behind schedule and the expected cost has more than doubled to €5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of that cost of the EPR will be paid by French taxpayers, construction costs and the impact of the delay will end up costing more than a €1000 for every man, woman and child in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't let the nuclear industry continue to push their fake climate change solutions onto the rest of the world. Tell world leaders to take personal responsibility and show up in Copenhagen to make a fair, ambitious and LEGALLY binding deal. We need real solutions to climate change from our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

	While politicians continue to talk, we're taking action at the frontline of forest and climate destruction in Indonesia.  Barack Obama is about to arrive in Asia for his first official visit while the US continues to block progress ahead of the critical UN climate summit.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Forest protection is one of the fastest ways to save the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas  emissions coming from cutting down and burning forests, it's clear we cannot avert a climate disaster unless world leaders take action of their own to stop the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt; Fifty of our activists  - from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Brazil and Finland - shut down deforestation operations in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; and stopped companies clearing and destroying the carbon-rich forest peatland and asked Obama to live up to the promise he made to take decisive action on climate change. With just weeks left before December's critical UN climate summit, his administration is actively undermining and stalling the climate change negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled a huge 20x30 metre banner in a freshly destroyed area of rainforest that read "Obama: you can stop this". Others locked themselves to all seven digging machines that were in the middle of destroying the rainforest in one of the pulpand paper concessions in the Kampar Peninsula - owned by Asia Pacific Resources International Holding Limited (APRIL -- one of Indonesia's biggest pulp and paper producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes and tropical rain - our activists managed to hold their nerve and remained locked onto the digging machinery. Workers even started three of the excavators and moved one of them with three of our activists still on its roof. They only stopped when other activists bravely sat right in front of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/24954/over-50-greenpeace-activists-f.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things began to get tense about 10 hours into the action - when company staff broke the chains and started another of the four diggers - even though it had 7 activists locked onto it. The  police moved in to stop the protest. Our activists are currently detained by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Liar, liar - trees on fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a letter we sent voicing our concerns about forest destruction in this region, pulp and paper company APRIL stated that it had ceased operations in the Kampar Peninsula. But we knew otherwise. So, earlier this week we released fresh evidence - including aerial surveillance images - that left no doubt that APRIL is destroying this rainforest. This data also raised damning suspicions that the company is draining and destroying forest peat that is deeper than three meters - the maximum depth allowed by Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, we brought this evidence to a public meeting held by APRIL in the regional capital of Pekanbaru where the company was introducing the latest of a string of so-called 'High Value Forest Assessments' aimed at greenwashing its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="act" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/forests/"&gt;Watch this space to see what happens next.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Dam it! We need forest protection NOW!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's action took place on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where we have set up a '&lt;a href="~/link/3b141ae58d144344a6be74868876572a.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Climate Defenders' Camp&lt;/a&gt;'. Rainforest and the destruction of the forest's carbon-rick peat soil in Indonesia emits huge quantities of CO2 and has driven Indonesia to become the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peatland in this area alone stores approximately 2 billion tonnes of carbon. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpsea/sets/72157622659240377/"&gt;Our activists at the camp&lt;/a&gt; have spent the past weeks &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/inglourious-treehuggers-climate031109/"&gt;constructing dams across the canals - built by paper companies top repare the land for plantations - to prevent them draining and destroying the forest and its peat and releasing all this CO2 to the atmosphere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two days, President Obama joins 20 other Heads of State in Singapore to discuss Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) - just a few weeks before he and other leaders must agree an historic deal to avert a climate crisis at December's UN climate summit. Instead of continuing to block progress - Obama and other world leaders need to push for an ambitious, fair and effective deal that includes ending the destruction of the world's rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end global deforestation, industrialised countries must invest 30 billion euros in forest protection (on an annual basis, mostly from polluters, not taxpayers). This is less than the US gave to individual banks during the financial crisis last year - a staggering $180billion went to bailout AIG alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Join our activists by calling on world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December - including a fund for forests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;It is thanks to people like you - that we are able to set up a camp and take action at the frontline of forest destruction. You can help make a difference tomorrow by giving whatever you can today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Glimmer of hope for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/pacific-tuna-hope121208/</url><text>
	The final outcome of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is too weak to stop overfishing of Pacific bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Pacific islanders are still at great risk from the collapse of this fishery. But the decision to close two of the high seas pockets, between Pacific Island countries, to purse seine fishing from 2010 has left them with a shred of hope.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For many pacific island countries, no tuna means no future.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will also consider the closure of a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt;
third high seas area&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. We have been campaigning for
these areas to be designated as marine reserves &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/where-are-the-pacific-tuna/"&gt;
since 2004&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, our ship, Esperanza, patrolled these high seas areas
for over ten weeks. During this time we took action againstfishing
fleets from &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/free-ocean-life050508/"&gt;
Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-demonstra"&gt;
Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/photos/greenpeace-activists-take-acti-3"&gt;
US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/pacific-pirate-busted100508/"&gt;
Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support sustainable fisheries, protect marine life
and clean up &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;
pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; in the region - &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning since 2001 that the bigeye and
yellowfin stocks in the Pacific are in decline and recommended a
minimum 30 percent reduction in fishing for 2009. Yet the
commission only agreed to cut fishing on bigeye tuna with a range
of measures including a 10 percent reduction for longliners
only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25073/greenpeace-activists-from-fiji.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;Greenpeace activists from Fiji and
Papua New Guinea stand on juvenileyellowfin and skipjack tuna in
the hold of a vessel that was caughtoffloading fish from purse
seiners in the Pacific Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuna exterminators strike back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Island countries, and the US
all put up a strong front to save the Pacific tuna. But resistance
from Japan, Korea, China, Chinese Taipei and the Philippines meant
that fishing will not be reduced enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nations, with a huge appetite for tuna, resisted moves to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, despite strong
economic arguments. Recent studies indicate that the fishing
industry is undermining its own profits by having too many fishing
vessels on the water and by depleting stocks to the point that fish
are harder to catch. We've been calling for a precautionary 50
percent fishing reduction in order to ensure both the long term
sustainability and profitability of the fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just add water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than protecting their fishing future - these
shortsighted governments are sending entire species into oblivion.
As usual consensus based decision making ensured that many
agreements were diluted to the lowest common denominator -
determined only by short term interests. The needs of the Pacific
Island States, whose livelihoods and economies depend on tuna, have
been neglected yet again - despite members of the fishing industry
calling upon these nations to follow the advice of scientists and
reduce fishing by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets and marine reserves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save fish for the future we're now calling on
retailers and fish purchasers  to stop buying all overfished
bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as well as skipjack caught using
fish aggregation devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also continuing to push for a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/"&gt;
global network of fully protected marine reserves&lt;/a&gt; covering 40
percent of our oceans. This will help to; buffer our seas from the
ravages of climate change, restore the health of fish stocks and
protect ocean life from habitat destruction and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Thanks to donations from individuals like you - we are able to support the Pacific islanders who are trying to preserve their way of life and economies. We don't accept donations from government or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	High-tech smuggling operations may not be what you'd normally associate with the ongoing clearance of the Amazon rainforest, but logging companies intent on plundering it for timber have been using hackers to break into the Brazilian government's sophisticated tracking system and fiddle the records.

&lt;p&gt;To monitor the amount of timber leaving the Amazon state of
Pará, the Brazilian environment ministry did away with paper
dockets and two years ago introduced an online system. Companies
logging the rainforest for timber or charcoal production are only
allowed to fell a certain amount of timber every year and this is
controlled by the use of transport permits issued by the state
government's computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be exported from Pará, each shipment of timber requires one
of these transport permits, and the volume of timber in each
shipment is deducted from the total amount allowed under the
company's forest management plan. Once that amount is reduced to
zero, no more transport permits are issued so there's no profit in
felling more trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil, the world's "hacking capital"&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what's supposed to happen. But today the public
prosecutor will release details of how hackers employed by 107
logging and charcoal companies have compromised the system,
falsifying online records to increase the timber transport
allocations for certain areas of the forest. In the past, Brazil
has been called the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3657170.stm"&gt;world's
hacking capital&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href="http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;amp;name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;amp;sid=743"&gt;
history of criminal gangs&lt;/a&gt; hacking into bank computer systems to
engage in large-scale online fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hacking has led to 1.7million cubic metres of timber being
illegally smuggled out of Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the Amazon hacking scandal is that nearly 1.7
million cubic metres of illegal timber have been smuggled out of
the Amazon, enough to fill 780 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The
sums of money involved are also huge, and the public prosecutor is
suing the companies responsible for 2 billion reais (US $833m).
According to federal prosecutor Daniel Avelino, many of these
companies have a track record of illegal practices: "Almost half of
the companies involved in this scam have other law suits pending
for environmental crimes or the use of slave labour, amongst other
things."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investigation started in April 2007&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police started investigating the suspect hackers in April 2007,
swooping in a couple of months later to arrest 30 ring leaders. One
is still in jail - the intermediary who brought the hackers and the
loggers together - in total, 202 people are facing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André Muggiati, campaigner in our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-brasil/"&gt;Amazon office&lt;/a&gt; in
Manaus, told me they have flagged up potential security holes in
the past. "We've pointed out before that this method of controlling
the transport of timber was subject to fraud. And this is only the
tip of the iceberg, because the same computer system is also used
in two other Brazilian states."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By hacking into the permit system, these companies have made
their timber shipments appear legal and compliant with the forest
management plans. But in reality, they're trading illegal timber
which is making the problem of deforestation worse, and a lack of
control and policing in the areas they're logging means they think
they can get away with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Scandal comes as Brazilian national congress prepares to vote
on forest code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scandal weren't bad enough, it comes as the Brazilian
national congress prepares to vote on a change to the country's
forest code which could massively increase the amount of legal
logging that will be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, land owners in the Amazon are able to clear trees
from 20 per cent of their property but if the proposed changes are
adopted, it will raise that to 50 per cent. Given the contentious
nature of land ownership in the region, no one knows exactly the
damage this will cause but as deforestation rates are once again on
the increase, it's certain to push them up even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Brazil must adopt a zero deforestation plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scandal of loggers and hackers just demonstrates that the
Brazilian government is failing to protect the Amazon forest from
logging companies determined to break the law. If the rainforest is
to have any long-term future, the only answer is to adopt a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt;
zero deforestation plan&lt;/a&gt;, like the one we and other campaign
groups think is needed, setting ambitious targets to bring
deforestation under control. Otherwise illegal logging and
corporate fraud such this will continue to be a massive
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

	Europe is known more for its ancient cities than ancient forests. And if Finnish paper companies have their way, there may soon be nothing left of the old forests that once covered most of Europe. But Greenpeace activists confronted paper imports in Germany to expose the ongoing destruction of Finland's forests.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2003/4/greenpeace-activists-paint-the.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists paint 'Forest Crime in Europe' on the hull of a paper carried to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists onboard inflatable boats intercepted the paper carrier "Finn Hawk" as it entered the Baltic Port of Luebeck in Germany. As the Finn Hawk navigated towards its berth, the activists painted "Forest Crime in Europe" on the hull of the ship to expose the ongoing destruction of European ancient forests in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finn Hawk is loaded with paper products from the Finnish paper companies Stora Enso and M-Real; both continue to buy wood for its products from the last of Finland's ancient forests. Other activists on the pier held a banner that read "Forest ministers of Europe: save our ancient forests".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want European ministers to make the right decisions to increase ancient forest protection in Europe during next week's Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe taking place in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after numerous conversations over the last 12 months, the paper companies have taken no real measures to stop the destruction of ancient forests in Finland. In fact, they are peddling their ancient forest destruction to Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few areas of Europe's formerly vast ancient forests still exist in Finland. Less than five percent of the current Finnish forest cover is ancient forest and only half of that is protected from industrial logging and further destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the traditional livelihoods of the indigenous Sami and other traditional communities. In the north-eastern part of Finland, many ancient forest areas are still unprotected and are being destroyed by the state-owned forest enterprise Metsahallitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main customers for the timber harvested by Metsahallitus are three international paper companies. This ancient forest timber is processed into pulp, magazine grade, fine paper and cardboard in the Finnish paper mills of Stora Enso, UPM Kymmene and M-Real then shipped to destinations in Europe and overseas. The ancient forests ends up as copy paper, envelopes, packaging, and in a range of publications from magazines and newspapers to advertising flyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, very few ancient forests and high conservation value forests are protected in Europe. Greenpeace is calling on European ministers to make real decisions to further the protection of the last ancient forests instead of only stressing sustainable forest management, which can not adequately protect Europe's forests alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="heading5"&gt;What can you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure you are not buying products coming from ancient forest destruction, look for the FSC® logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC®, or Forest Stewardship Council™, is an international non-profit organisation that issues certificates for well managed forests and was created so that corporate buyers and individual consumers can identify products coming from responsible forest management. Look for the FSC® logo to the left on wood and paper products to make sure you aren't buying forest destruction or supporting illegal logging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	The nuclear industry has had fifty years of massive subsidies and state help – but has delivered only unsafe, expensive power, contamination and waste that will last for thousands of generations.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mickey Mouse climate solutions
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, over 350 non-governmental organisations including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF told delegates at the UN climate talks that nuclear power is not a climate solution but a dangerous distraction from investment in renewable power and energy efficiency. Representing millions of members in 48 countries, the organisations have proclaimed nuclear power a "Mickey Mouse climate solution" and delivered a global call to keep it out of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to pass up the chance of ever more state support and win more taxpayers' money, the nuclear industry is presenting itself as a practical solution to climate change. One of the privileges this dirty and dying industry wants now is to become eligible for support under Kyoto Treaty mechanisms. If that goes through, a country such as France could finance the construction of a reactor in a developing country by a French firm - giving money to its own companies and claiming "emission allowances" for itself so that it doesn't have to reduce its own domestic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to include nuclear power in the Kyoto Protocol CDM is currently being discussed at the UN Climate talks in Poznan These talks coincide with a run of bad news for the nuclear industry that makes its claims of clean cheap power even harder to justify. Following the news of soaring costs for the European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) in &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/epr_history_repeating_costs_up.html"&gt; France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/the_financial_times_finlands_s.html"&gt; Finland&lt;/a&gt; and  in the estimated budgets for &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/11/dont_believe_the_hype.html"&gt; reactors planned in the US&lt;/a&gt;, came the news that South-Africa - till now seen as one of the most promising candidates for a so-called nuclear "renaissance" - &lt;a title="Nukes out of Africa" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/non_merci_areva_is_out_of_afri.html"&gt;is backing off for a while&lt;/a&gt;: the planned French reactors are simply too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented its pro-nuclear case in Poznan last week, we were there to confront them with reality. And the IAEA had no defence other than to say that things would get better in the future! This is something that we and our parents have been hearing for fifty years now. The IAEA needs to stop dreaming - the climate will not wait and we need to get serious about combating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bring some facts to the debate, Greenpeace has prepared &lt;a title="Facts on Nuclear Power" href="/international/PageFiles/25075/getting-serious-about-nuclear.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Together with other NGOs, we also organised our own official "side event" in Poznan - a specialised session that exposed the facts behind the nuclear "renaissance" smokescreen: nuclear power has been in decline in recent years, with more reactors being closed than built; escalating costs combined with the recent financial crisis are having a devastating effect on the nuclear industry's reputation with financial institutions and bankers. We were delighted to see a crowd of over 100 press and country delegates getting detailed facts on the poor performance of the nuclear industry, something the nuclear industry has been trying to hide from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This side event alone isn't going to stop the nuclear lobby trying to sneak in by the backdoor to get its grubby hands on climate mitigation funding. But it's clear there's a very depressed mood in the nuclear industry's camp, and that negotiators and press from all over the whole world are beginning to understand that the nuclear "renaissance" hype is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Tell governments the world is watching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Sending out an SOS for Pacific tuna</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/tuna-sos-081208/</url><text>
	Our activists together with Korean environmental group KFEM created a huge human "SOS Tuna" banner on the shores of a beach in Busan, Korea, as a key regional meeting in Korea began this week. This extremely critical meeting will decide the fate of valuable tuna stocks in the Pacific, which are now seriously threatened due to overfishing. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Time and tuna are running out!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific ocean is rich in marine life and home to over 20 IslandNations. Today, the Pacific supplies over 6 percent of the world's tuna. Butoverfishing in other areas of the world means more and more boats aremoving in, and chasing fewer and fewer fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge industrial tuna boats, capable of catching as many tuna in onetrip as some of the countries are able to take in a year, areplundering this vulnerable region at a rate that means trouble for thetuna as well as the people whose livelihoods and futures depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These boats originate from countries like Korea, Japan and Taiwan andfeed the ever-increasing appetites for tuna in the luxury Asian, European and US markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not just about saving some fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lives and economies of Pacific Islanders and Pacific Island nations are in peril as big eye and yellow fin tuna stocks are threatened from overfishing. Pacific communities are at the mercy of unscrupulous foreign fishersand our growing global appetite for tuna is in the grip of unfair andunsustainable fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on delegates at this week's Western and CentralPacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting in Korea to implement measures fora sustainable and profitable fishing industry. TheWCPFC must start putting words into action byagreeing on strong and effective measures. A precautionary and ecosystem-based approach isneeded to preserve the rich marine diversity of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce, protect and reject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be an immediate halving offishing, a closure to fishing in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/"&gt; the high seas pockets&lt;/a&gt; and an immediatehalt to the transfer of fish at sea to discourage piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCPFC must ensure decisions are not hijacked againby a small minority of nations that are not acting in the best interestof Pacific people, their valuable tuna resources andthe health of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one last chance to ensure the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks do notface the same fate as bluefin tuna of the Mediterranean. The Commission has to be preparedto face the consequences if negotiations break down to governments andindustry ruthlessly bargaining for the last tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ship, the Esperanza, is present in Korea to bear witness tothe WCPFC's decisions, which will dictate the future of Pacific tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea should lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have joined forces with Korean environmental group KFEM to ensure that Korea, as the host nation and key player in the fishery, takes the lead in making sure that this meeting takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need marine reserves which will fully protect the most vulnerable breeding grounds of the tuna from exploitation. We need sustainable management measures outside those areas that will secure a future for this fishery and for the future of the millions of Pacific island people that depend on this resource for their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow we need marine reserves today. Join the call for a global network of marine reserves protecting 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;Without donations from individuals like you, we can't afford to attend meetings like this one in Korea to pressure governments who need to make the right decisions to protect our planet. We don't take any corporate or government donations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Representatives of millions of Greenpeace supporters from around the world arrived at the doorstep of the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo today to demand an end to the political persecution of two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, and an end to Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean. Embassy actions are scheduled around the world today and tomorrow.

            A "living statue" of Lady justice protests on behalf of Greenpeace in front of the Japanese embassy in The Hague, Netherlands.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-defendants include the chief whale-defenders (officially, &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/japanese-whaling/whaling-on-trial-120508/about-the-co-defendants/"&gt; Executive Directors&lt;/a&gt;) of Greenpeace offices from Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil, USA and the Nordic countries, as well as Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Condemned by Amnesty International&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the group  declared themselves 'co-defendants' in the trial of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki. The two Greenpeace activists exposed corruption in the taxpayer-funded whaling industry, but were themselves &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; arrested in a crackdown on Greenpeace itself in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a million Greenpeace supporters wrote to the Prime Minister to demand their release. The arrest was &lt;a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/japan-must-respect-rights-of-detained-greenpeace-activists-20080715" target="_blank"&gt;denounced by Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, and fits a pattern of repression of the rights of free speech in Japan which has been condemned by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group challenged the Prime Minister to set Junichi and Toru free, and end the corrupt whaling programme, or order their own arrest for daring to oppose the whaling programme. 30,000 people have also &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-me"&gt;signed petitions declaring themselves complicit in Junichi and Toru's actions&lt;/a&gt;, and stated that if defending whales is a crime, they too are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whaling on trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want Prime Minister Aso to know that if Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki are to be tried for exposing whale meat embezzlement and working to endthe killing of whales in the Japanese Government's 'research' programmein the Southern Ocean, then we should all be arrested," said JunHoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan. "It's not Greenpeace activists who should be put on trial; it is the government-backed  whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a Greenpeace undercover investigation in May 2008 that exposed the embezzlement of whale meat from the taxpayer-funded whaling fleet, Japanese authorities responded with a politically-motivated prosecution, arresting Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki and raiding the Greenpeace Japan office in June 2008. They have now been awaiting trial for 172 days under bail conditions which prevent hem from continuing their Greenpeace campaign work to end whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to begin early next year; they are both facing upto 10 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/arrest-us"&gt;events will be happening throughout today and tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; at Japanese embassies in Brazil, USA, New Zealand, Argentina, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Canada,  Italy and on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, activists declared themselves as 'co-defendants', by asking the Japanese government to "Arrest Me Too" and to put "Whaling on Trial".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proof of life after whaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian ex-whaling captain Paddy Hart, in Tokyo to support the TokyoTwo and the campaign to end Japan's whaling, was a master and gunner atthe Cheynes Beach Whaling Station in Western Australia until it ceasedoperation in 1978 - following Greenpeace protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm here to assure whalers that there is life after whaling. Japan'swhaling programme is a taxpayer-funded government enterprise, so when it finally ends, it's the responsibility of the Japanese government and theFisheries Agency to retrain the crews for other, sustainable, work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Australia alone, 300 million Australian dollars are made every year fromwhalewatching - hundreds of times more than was ever made by the whalingindustry", said Hart. "I am proud of my time at sea, but it was 30 yearsago. Times have changed, and the world has moved on - whaling no longerhas a place in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We're all Junichi and Toru&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2008/12/junichi-toru-mask-thumbs.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="304"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: 70%"&gt;Opposed to whaling? We're all Junichi &amp;amp; Toru.  Download and print a mask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know the story of Spartacus? He was the leader of a slave revolt in ancient Rome.  When soldiers put down the uprising, the Romans demanded to know which of the slaves was Spartacus.  One by one, each slave stood up to declare that he was Spartacus, masking their leader's true identiy and declaring their unity with his cause.  &lt;/p&gt;

	People across the world took to the streets for a Global Day of Action on Saturday, to tell the governments meeting in Poznan, Poland for crucial UN climate negotiations, that the world is watching them.
&lt;div&gt;

            Greenpeace activists in India, taking part in the 2008 Global Day of Action for the climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers in 23 countries from Australia to Italy to Mexico to the Philippines to Turkey to the US joined or led a series of protests, demonstrations and outreach events to ensure that Ministers arriving in &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/negotiations/un-climate-conference/"&gt; Poznan&lt;/a&gt; listen to the will of their citizens, and get serious about climate action. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YM806Vheo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the action day in Poznan itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world is watching governments in Poznan" said Mareike Britten, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner. "Saturday's actions clearly show that people across the world recognise that it's time for governments to get serious about climate action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a flash mob of people in swimming gear in Amsterdam, to protests in Red Square, Moscow to banner messages on Aztec pyramids in Mexico, to installing solar panels in Thailand, and giving a solar powered Parol (a Filipino Christmas lantern) to the Philippine senate, to a giant postcards reading "Dear World Leaders, we are ready to save the climate" in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, to a boat protest on the Ganga River in India, our map below highlights key Greenpeace activities across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take action! The global day of action is over, but it's not too late for you tell your government you are watching them. Join activists from around the world by &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt; uploading your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the Poznan meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>UN climate negotiations begin in Poznan</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/un-climate-conference/</url><text>
	It has been a year since governments in Bali pledged to nail down an agreement to save the climate by December 2009. That means they have one year left to agree on how to stop the climate crisis. This year’s UN meeting on Climate Change has just started in Poznan, Poland and we think it is about time for government leaders to stop the talking, get serious and start real negotiations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/get-serious-quit-coal-greenp.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/get-serious-quit-coal-greenp.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real climate action means quitting our addiction to coal. It's time to get serious.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest destruction costs the world economy at least 2 trillion dollars annually. Ocean fish stocks are collapsing, putting a basic source of food for 3 billion people at risk. Droughts and forest fires are destroying our planet's most precious resources and rising sea levels are threatening to displace hundreds of millions of people before the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn't all bad news, the good news is that the solution is pretty simple: to avoid runaway climate change, the world needs to quit its addiction to coal and stop destroying forests - and that work has to start in Poznan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start investing in a future we can all believe in. We need investments in clean, renewable energy and an end to subsidies for dirty and dangerous energy like coal and nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Rescue Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some government leaders have proven that they cannot be trusted to take swift action on climate change based on the facts. From the coal mines of Konin, to the meeting rooms at the UN meetings in Poznan, we are taking action to make sure that government leaders know it is time to get serious about climate change and quit coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  &lt;a title="QUIT COAL" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/"&gt;Quit Coal Tour&lt;/a&gt; has set up a &lt;a title="CLIMATE RESCUE STATION" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/climate-rescue/"&gt;Climate Rescue Station&lt;/a&gt; in Konin, Poland- one hour form the UN meeting - to highlight the true cost of coal in the lead up to crucial UN climate negotiations. The Rescue Station is currently set up on the edge of an open pit coal mine where activists have been demanding an end to our addiction to coal in a series of direct actions. On 8 December, a week into the talks, the dome will be moved to Poznan town square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that the truth is heard at the UN meetings, we've also sent a team of climate experts to Poznan. We are there to pressure governments to quit coal and work towards a meaningful deal to save the climate. Our message to delegates is simple - it's time to get serious about tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not just another meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year doesn't seem like a lot of time to most of us, considering the scope of the problem. After two decades of climate negotiations, governments are still tip-toeing around each other when it comes to real solutions to climate change. This year the world is watching the UN negotiations and demanding that governments make good on their promise to come up with an action plan in Copenhagen next year. Be a part of the action and &lt;a title="THE WORLD IS WATCHING" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;upload your photo&lt;/a&gt; to be projected at the UN meeting in Poznan, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's what we need from our leaders in Poznan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Developed countries must agree greenhouse gas emission reduction targets at the upper end of 25-40%, as identified by the IPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/global-day-of-climate-action-08/the-world-is-watching/"&gt;Make sure government leaders know that The World is Watching and we expect them to commit to a climate deal at next year's talks in Copenhagen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely donations from individuals like you. We don't accept money from governments of corporations.Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	If we are to avert catastrophic climate change the world must quit coal. But, the industry and the powerful forces which rely on it will not go down without a fight. Today, in Warsaw, Greenpeace, provided them with two reminders of why we should quit coal. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tell major global polluters in Poland to "Get Serious, Quit Coal".
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists dumped coal on the doorstep of a luxury Warsaw hotel, where industry ministers from 20 countries are meeting to discuss coal's future, unveiling a banner saying 'Get serious, quit coal!'. Greenpeace has also published a report on the "True Cost of Coal": estimating the annual financial costs of coals' climate impact, health impact and the cost of deadly mining accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the Polish Government, the conference documents claim that the meeting is being held to agree on policies to help the climate - but the agenda reveals it is about saving profits, not the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background documents on the 'Summit on Sectoral Cooperation,' describe coal as the main fuel for power generation in the future and discuss "adequate policy actions."  The documents hold up the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as a "spectacular" example of good policy initiatives on climate protection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this partnership is just a coal pact - an agreement by some of the world's leading polluters to do nothing in particular, by no particular time and in no particular way.  In the face of catastrophic climate change that's worse than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Cost of Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with this meeting is the release of our report "The True Cost of Coal", which describes the costs coal imposes on society. Produced in conjunction with the independent Dutch Institute CE Delft, the report puts a price tag on some of the more obvious damages caused along the coal chain-of-custody, including climate change, health impacts from air pollution and loss of life from mining accidents.  Last year, these damages cost the world at least 360 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all the costs of coal can be measured in dollars and cents. In Columbia, indigenous communities are threatened and forced off their lands to make way for coal mines; thousands in Jharia, India, suffer from horrendous living conditions because of uncontrollable coal fires; in Russia, unsafe mining conditions have meant injury and death for scores of workers. We tell twelve of these stories in our report, but there are thousands more to be found wherever coal is mined or burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places like Indonesia, China and Thailand, air pollution from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, damaging ancient relics, reducing crop yields and killing people. The legacy of mining ensures that land in South Africa will continue to be poisoned by acid mine drainage long after mines are closed. Iin the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland, mining activities have caused the water level of Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically. In the United States coal has meant blowing up mountains, burying streams and contaminating nearby communities. In Germany, reclaiming opencast mines has created dead lakes with water as acid as vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in response to the unmitigated destruction and harm caused by coal, communities are rising up.  In Australia, winemakers, horse breeders, local residents and miners are saying no to mine expansion and yes to a just transition to renewable energy.  In the Philippines, a diverse group has united to oppose a new coal-fired power station, calling instead for clean energy development.  Stories such as these inspire, provide hope and point towards a better future - one not marred by dirty coal but fuelled by energy sources that are safe, sustainable and will protect our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is days away from sealing a deal on its own response to climate change, with a series of laws known as the 'climate package', which should provide a boost to renewable energy and reduce Europe's reliance on coal.  The European position will have a massive bearing on global negotiations to strengthen the successor to the Kyoto Protocol, culminating in Copenhagen at the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25082/true-cost-of-coal-report-launc.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poland threatens climate package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is currently threatening to block the EU package. Despite a recent report  showing that implementing the proposed climate package would benefit the Polish economy, vested interests have convinced the Polish government otherwise. Poland generates 90% of its power from burning coal, and the industry has convinced the government that their interests come before those of the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why there won't be any representatives from the renewable industry attending the Sheraton shindig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future without coal is not only possible, it is necessary if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change. The most effective way to do this is for the world to work together under one agreement. Poland, host of the upcoming climate talks, in Poznan, could have designed a meeting to help progress towards an environmentally effective global agreement on climate protection rather than one likely to hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're calling on all countries at the UN climate negotiations next week to get serious and put a meaningful proposal on the table. The proposal must include a "climate vision" which will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40%, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt;Bluefin tuna is highlyprized in Asian markets as sushi, and overfishing has decimated thestocks. Bluefin are slow to mature and many young tuna are caughtbefore they have the chance to reproduce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greenpeace and other environmental groups have called for the closure of the bluefin tuna fisheries, to give them time to recover. But the governments responsible for managing the fishery are refusing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), concluded in Marrakech with an agreement allowing over 22,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna to be landed -- around 7,500 tonnes over the level recommended by scientists to avoid the collapse of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last-chance tuna bazaar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fall under the 'management' of ICCAT, a body made up of government representation from 45 countries plus the European Community.&lt;span id="spanSummary"&gt;&lt;span id="lSummary"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But this year's session looked more like a bazaar, in which buyers haggled over the last remaining tuna, than an international meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management plan they agreed to fails to protect the spawning population and merely shortens  the purse seine fishing season, responsible for the bulk of illegal catches, by 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union, representing the majority of Mediterranean countries with interests in the bluefin tuna fishery, bullied other parties in the meeting into agreeing to management proposals which completely fail to follow the advice of ICCAT's own scientific body to substantially reduce fishing and protect the species' spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure from the European countries has been so strong that they have even managed to slow downthe 'payback' for the illegal catches made in the region in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Time for new management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"The game is over - ICCAT has missed its last chance to save the bluefin tuna from stock collapse," said Sebastian Losada, Greenpeace Spain Oceans Campaigner, who has been attending the Marrakech meeting. "Bluefin tuna has become an endangered species because of ICCAT mismanagement. It's time to take the fishery out of their hands and look to Conventions like CITES to impose trade restrictions on thespecies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;"These past seven days have demonstrated that ICCAT is a farce," said Losada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;In 2006, following years of extremely high levels of pirate fishing, among others by European Union fishing vessels, ICCAT agreed a bluefin tuna "recovery plan" that set a 'Total Allowable Catch' of 29,500 tonnes for the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;ICCAT's own Scientific Committee recommended a sustainable limit of 15,000 tonnes. Since then, the very same scientists have estimated that actual bluefin tuna catches were about 61,000 tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; Greenpeace demanded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/ICCAT-16"&gt; a closure of the fishery&lt;/a&gt; until a proper recovery plan is inplace including at a very minimum a Total Allowed Catch (TAC) in line with the scientific advice, a seasonal closure covering the months of May, June and July and the establishment of marine reserves to protect the bluefin tuna spawning grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;Disgrace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the main fishing countries such as Spain and France, which currently leads the Union of 27 Member States, should bear the brunt of the criticism for this shameful outcome. They have again placed short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species, and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently released performance review of ICCAT written by a panel of experts appointed by ICCAT itself recommended&lt;em&gt; "the suspension of fishing on bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" and&lt;/em&gt; states that "&lt;em&gt;the management ... of this bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean is widely seen as an international disgrace.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, ICCAT has lived up to that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/marine-reserves-now"&gt;If we want fish tomorrow, we need marine reserves today.  Join the call to protect 40 percent of our world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/support-us"&gt;In order to maintain our independence, we accept no money from governments or corporations.  Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Three hundred and forty Greenpeace activists were arrested as they took their demand to "Bail out the Planet" to European Union finance ministers in Brussels. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hundreds of activists were arrested as they demanded EU finance ministers "Bail out the planet."
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists blocked the exits of the building where the ministers
were meeting, and demanded an answer on the climate funding
question. Swarms of uniformed officers, riot police and
plain-clothed cops descended on the activists as a line of black
armoured vehicles, police vans and busses moved in to block the
public view of the activist-guarded doors. Electric saws were used
to cut through the locks and police dragged activists face down
into the line of police vehicles. It took the police more than two
hours to remove all of the peaceful activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the men and women of EU finance met to discuss the financial
crisis and the climate crisis, we asked a question: where is the
money to avert runaway climate change? Because it looks to us like
there's far more interest in bailing out banks then in bailing out
a planet headed toward a bankrupt future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions made today by EU finance ministers are important
because they will directly influence Europe's position at the
historic UN climate summit in Copenhagen this December. Richer
developed countries need to contribute at least €110 billion a year
by 2020 to make sure developing countries are able to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases and cope with the already unavoidable
impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country's contribution towards a climate bailout plan is
based on its ability to pay and its level of responsibility in
causing climate change. Based on this, the  European governments'
share is €35 billion a year by 2020, the equivalent of just €1.30 a
week per European citizen: the price of a bus ticket.  To help
raise these funds, we are supporting a new scheme that puts a price
tag on greenhouse gas emissions and asks rich countries to pay for
their carbon footprint according to their means and their
responsibility for causing the climate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: All of the activists have been released from jail and
their were no serious injuries sustained. View video from the

	The largest shipment of deadly plutonium in history is about to leave the French port of Cherbourg - final destination Japan. We’ve taken action to send the message that this is yet another glaring example of the unacceptable risks posed by nuclear energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/3/greenpeace-activists-beam-a-ta.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A target symbol projected onto a truck loaded with plutonium in MOX fuel. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists in France have tracked the shipment which contains 1.8 tons of plutonium in Mixed-Oxide (MOX) fuel. This is enough to make 225 nuclear weapons, each more powerful than the bomb that devastated &lt;a href="http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/na-bomb/museum/museume01.html"&gt; Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've demonstrated with distress flares and "Stop Plutonium" banners at the Cherbourg port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We projected a "target" symbol and "Nuclear Madness made in France" onto the nearby state owned AREVA reprocessing plant in La Hague, where the MOX was produced. Our activists also projected the same messages onto the trucks carrying the deadly cargo to Cherbourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our position is simple. The world needs an immediate ban on MOX shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ships, the Pacific Heron and Pacific Pintail will be used to transport the radioactive cargo. They will leave on March 6, just after departure AREVA will reveal which route the deadly waste will take to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mox - a deadly fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest dangers of plutonium is that it can be used to make nuclear weapons. MOX increases the dangers of nuclear proliferation, as the plutonium in it is easier to extract for weapons use than plutonium in spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also plenty of evidence showing that the containers used to transport the MOX are not strong enough to withstand serious accidents or terrorist attack. Risk of fire is just one example, the containers are only tested over a few hours, but fires on board ships can last much longer (days or even weeks).  Once MOX fuel disperses it poses a grave threat to public health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a plutonium shipment in 2002, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda stated "our small states are fearful that a deliberate act of terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence. This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all this, it is little wonder that plutonium and MOX shipments have been opposed by dozens of governments and their citizens, since they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AREVA is denying the risks of proliferation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AREVA denies that there is any proliferation risk by claiming a false distinction between "military grade" and "civil grade" nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) thinks differently classifying commercial plutonium MOX fuel as Category 1 nuclear material, requiring the highest level of security protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the world now has more weapons usable plutonium in civil nuclear programmes than in all nuclear weapons arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the Japan's Citizens Nuclear Information Center and Green Action organisations we've &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/Open-letter-ElBaradei"&gt; written to Mohammed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, head of the IAEA warning him that AREVA is either dangerously confused, or is deliberately misrepresenting the proliferation threat posed by the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also sent &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/open-letter-en-route-countries/"&gt; letters to the governments&lt;/a&gt; of  countries that may be en route, warning them of the potential dangers to their populations and environment; and urging them to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2009/3/mox-map-route.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25048/moxmap-thumb.jpg" alt="moxmap.jpg" width="430" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;The most likely route of the MOX shipment is via South Africa and across the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia, and through the coastal waters of South Pacific nations. Other possible routes are via the Caribbean and Panama Canal or via South America and Cape Horn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan has been failing to use MOX for their nuclear reactors for over a decade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has been trying to use MOX in their nuclear reactors for more than ten years; and have repeatedly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shipment to Japan in 1999 ended in fiasco after the producer, UK state company British Nuclear Fuels, admitted it had deliberately falsified vital quality control safety data. After an 18,000-mile voyage, the rejected fuel was shipped back to the UK. Two more cargoes, one delivered in 1999, the other in 2001, were opposed by local citizens and regional governments. Both shipments remain in storage with no prospect that they will ever be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough already, stop the Nuclear madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as though anything has changed. Shipping MOX remains as dangerous as ever. Governments across the world have recognised the threat and in 2005 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/MIM/A-conf.207-L.6-Mauritius%20Declaration.pdf"&gt; a moratorium on all nuclear transports&lt;/a&gt; was tabled at a UN summit. It's time to make that resolution a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the best efforts of the nuclear industry to convince us otherwise, the simple truth is that you can't separate "civil" nuclear from nuclear used for weapons. They are two parts of the same extremely dangerous whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for industry claims that nuclear power can be used in the fight against climate change, the opposite is true. Nuclear power is too little, too late, too dangerous. In fact, it &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25048/nuclear-power-undermining-cl.pdf"&gt; undermines the true solutions to climate change&lt;/a&gt; by diverting urgently needed resources away from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be following the MOX shipment on our &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/"&gt;nuclear reaction blog&lt;/a&gt;, sign up for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Our vision of a better future is only as strong as the people who support us.  Join Greenpeace today and add your voice to the movement that's committed to defending our planet.  Your support will make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish mine workers attack peaceful Greenpeace protest</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/climate-rescue-attacked-241108/</url><text>
	Peaceful protesters from the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station were attacked by mine workers when they entered the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine. As the activists prepared to paint a huge "Stop" sign next to a giant excavator they were assaulted and prevented from carrying out their peaceful protest. A journalist accompanying the activists was beaten. Local people are also against the expansion of this mine, because it threatens their homes and livelihoods. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2008/11/climate-rescue-station-3.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Climate Rescue Station overlooks the vast Jóźwin IIB open pit mine.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our action is not against the miners but it is addressed to the Polish government. We demand that the forthcoming Polish energy policy contain a concrete plan for quitting coal and implementing renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also object to opening any new power plants working for lignite. Lignite is the most destructive fuel," says Magdalena Zowsik, Climate and Energy Campaigner in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists at the mine are part of the Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station, which was set up two weeks ago at the edge of the mine to bear witness to the destruction and environmental devastation caused by coal. Just last week 400 members of local communities whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by the mine joined us in a peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Energy [R]evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More then 90 percent of energy in Poland is produced by burning coal, but it doesn't have to be that way. The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution scenario for Poland shows how Poland can make the transition to generating 80 percent of its power using renewable sources. That would mean an end to the destructive mining and devastated countryside that scars Poland. It would also mean Poland would cease to be one of the twenty largest emitters of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland's addiction to coal doesn't just harm its environment, it also drives its role in international talks. With the EU just days away form sealing a deal on a response to climate change Poland is actively trying to water down the package so it can carry on polluting. With Poland also due to host the UN Climate Negotiations on December 1 it is essential that Poland adopts a progressive attitude toward the talks and make itself part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Poland and the world need an energy revolution, not more of the same," adds Zowsik. "The science is unequivocal, if we try to continue burning coal we will do untold damage to the planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poznan, Greenpeace wants to see governments agree a "climate vision" that will address what the science requires: global emissions peaking by 2015. We want to see developed countries agree to targets of 25-40 percent cuts, along with a draft negotiating text on the table and a detailed workplan to get this completed by the time the next round of climate talks begin in Copenhagen in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>VICTORY! Philips accepts recycling responsibility</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-philips260209/</url><text>
	We are delighted that Philips has announced a change in its recycling policy, taking responsibility for the cost of recycling its own products. Earlier this week Philips confirmed that these costs should no longer be paid directly by its customers through an additional fixed fee but instead come closer to being part of the overall product price.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/philips-celebrates-its-110-yea-2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Encouraged by Greenpeace pressure, Philips has accepted responsibility for their own products with their new recycling policy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips had been the biggest obstacle in the electronics industry to tacklingthe growing problem of &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/"&gt; e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. And we have been calling on them since 2007 to stop actively opposing laws that would oblige electronics producers to accept financial responsibility for the recycling of their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several actions and 47,000 messages from our supporters, the company has finally agreed to our demands. This is a big step forward, and makes Philips a new green leader in the electronics sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only good news for consumers but also for the environment - because recycling costs are influenced by the amount of toxic chemicals present in products and how easy it is to recycle them. Producers like Philips now have the added incentive to develop cleaner, more recyclable products that will reduce recycling costs now that they are paying for the collection and recycling of their own products. Producer responsibility is crucial to the greener development of the electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/philips-from-zero-to-hero/blog/10240/"&gt; Discover how Philips went from zero to hero on our blog (rumour has it that Skittles were involved!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking it back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips is also creating take-back systems for its waste within some countries where legislation does not currently oblige it to do so. It intends to set up a global take-back system, but still has to commit to an implementation timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/recycling/ourrecyclingprogram/index.page"&gt; Philips' commitment&lt;/a&gt; to a financially sensible recycling policy, together with the simple step of taking back its obsolete products and recycling them properly everywhere, is likely to substantially improve its ranking in our next &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/" target="_blank"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25052/greenpeace-dumps-philips-elect-2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better for the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics giant has also made commitments to make substantial cuts in its own greenhouse gas emissions and support a 30 percent emissions reduction for industrial nations by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest edition of our Green Electronics Guide had shown Philips to be one of the leaders on energy, but still &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/greener-electronics-philips-ra-3/"&gt; scoring abysmally on e-waste&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the public pressure mounted on the company over the last couple of years, with this week's announcement Philips now becomes one of the leaders in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to now be able to hold Philips up as an example of how electronics companies can be truly green across the board. We now want to see Philips maintain a leading role by helping to ensure future legislation on e-waste continues to ensure Individual Producer Responsibility and fully integrate environmental costs into product prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow the leader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be pressuring other companies to follow Philips' lead, and embrace producer responsibility. Electronics waste is often dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Some is exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia or Africa. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/following-the-e-waste-trail" target="_blank"&gt;Only last week, we exposed the illegal export of e-waste from Western countries to Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>EXPOSED! Pirates bankrolled by Spanish government</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/exposed-pirates-bankrolled-by/</url><text>
	We've just presented evidence to the Fisheries Committee of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) that the Spanish company Vidal Armadores S. A., despite being involved in pirate fishing, received over 3.5 million Euros in Spanish government subsidies. On top of that, the company is still getting help from the Spanish government in securing contracts and licences to fish in other countries. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2006/3/rostock.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Real pirates get punished, right? Aarrgh, not in Spain, matey! There they get subsidised.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/pirate-fishing/"&gt;Pirate fishing&lt;/a&gt; - known by its less colourful name: illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing -&lt;/span&gt; costs the world US$4 billion annually and &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;leaves communities that depend on fish without much needed food and income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal"&gt;In the Southern Pacific, pirate fishing for the prized Patagonia toothfish (also known as "sea bass") has driven the species to the brink of commercial extinction. &lt;/span&gt;Illegal fleets catching the remaning toothfish here are predominantly controlledby northern hemisphere transnational crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off the radar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is currently running a fleet of at least five vessels in the Southern Ocean, at least three of which are blacklisted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Commission - part of the Antarctic TreatySystem - manages fishing activities in the Southern Ocean. It blacklists vessels for engaging in pirate activity or failing to respect conservation measures, and the 24 member states agree not to buy fish from blacklisted vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a blacklisted vessel transfers its catch at sea to another ship, who is to know? In 2007, CCAMLR estimated that pirate vessels caught more than 3600 tonnes of toothfish and killed more than 8000 seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, New Zealand inspectors documented that the Namibian-flagged &lt;a href="http://blacklist.greenpeace.org/0/vessel/show/156-paloma-v"&gt;Paloma V&lt;/a&gt; had been involved in &lt;a href="http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Features/945-Illegal-Fishing-activities.php"&gt; illegal transshipments&lt;/a&gt;. It was blacklisted by CCAMLR as a result. The inspection revealed that the vessel was operating together with other ships in the Vidal fleet including the blacklisted North Korean-flagged Chilbo San 33 and Black Moon, as well as the Spanish-flagged Belma and Galaecia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Spain signed an agreement with Namibia in 2008 that gave the Belma access to Namibian fishing grounds, and has provided Vidal Armadores with other assistance in securing contracts and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hook them and book them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on all countries participating in the Committee on Fisheries in Rome to take the evidence presented to them seriously and urgently work towards closing the loopholes that these operators use to avoid controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidal Armadores is not alone - fishing companies around the world use transshipments and loopholes to evade the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need bodies like the UN FAO to support strong regulations involving the ports that these ships enter, create a global record of fishing vessels and to urgently reduce commercial fishing to a sustainable level. It is simply a matter of political will to deliver the kind of enforcement that is needed to protect the marine environment and the communities which depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the case of Vidal Armadores, we want to see the Spanish government take real action to stop ocean plunder - they can start by asking for their subsidies back. Then they can prosecute any Spanish nationals that were captains or masters of the ships. Then they can revoke all Vidal Armadores' licenses and stop helping them get contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/"&gt;Join the call for a global network of marine reserves to protect the world's oceans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In advance of Hillary Clinton's arrival in Beijing, we have delivered an open letter, together with a giant hourglass, calling for immediate cooperation and leadership between the US and China to stop global warming.The hourglass, inscribed with the words “time is running out”, refers to the time left to take effective action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/External/image/2009/2/activists-welcome-obama-6.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Obama administration is asked to lead on climate change action in China, Indonesia and Canada.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Obama administration and China have an historic opportunity to act on both the most serious economic crisis in decades and the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced - the looming climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the ways in which the US and China are different there is onething they share - the immediate need to stop climate change. China and the US are the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Commitments from both nations may differ but the urgency of the task facing us means every nation must play its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25053/open-letter-hillary.pdf"&gt; Our letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to both the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, states: "The current economic crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to make investments in a way that creates jobs, rebuilds critical infrastructure and lays the foundation for a new energy economy in both nations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer melting of the Arctic, more severe hurricanes, increasing drought, wildfires and heatwaves; these impacts are all signs of an increasingly chaotic climate system that will undermine the economic and development goals of all nations. Time is running out. Dr James Hansen, a leading climatologist from NASA, recently stated that the world is now in "imminent peril". The window for avoiding that peril is narrow, and closing rapidly, but it is not yet closed. With the right leadership, we can bring global greenhouse gas emissions under control, set them on a downward trajectory, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from our open letter to Hillary Clinton and Yang Jiechi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China need to show leadership for strong climate action, ensuring a sustainable energy future and economic security. By the end of this year, governments must agree to rapidly accelerate action on climate change. A negotiation process will begin soon and concludes at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not too late - yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao, when they meet ahead of April's G20 meeting in London, to issue a joint statement on the need for global action and their commitment to ensure an effective plan is agreed. We have also asked them to attend the Copenhagen meeting in person and hope they will call on the rest of world to join them in their efforts - before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have already been encouraging signs of cooperation between the two countries on renewable energy and energy efficiency, we want to make it absolutely clear that leadership is essential and time is quickly running out. The creation of a new development model that meets energy, moves both nations away from coal, and generates millions of green jobs without sacrificing human health or the environment is not only possible - it is absolutely vital. Also needed is an equitable financial mechanism encouraging greener development not only in China but also throughout Southern Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgency underlined in Indonesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton also received a similar letter from our Southeast Asia office while she was visiting Indonesia recently. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/en/news/greenpeace-challenges-presiden"&gt; The letter, addressed to her and President Yudhoyono, was delivered to the US Embassy and the Presidential Palace in Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Our activists held a rally outside as a meeting took place between the two leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called on Clinton to use her visit to take action against climate change. Developed countries like the US must provide funds to countries like Indonesia in order for them to tackle global warming by preserving forests and reducing greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping Obama will say "No we won't" for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/en/recent/greenpeace-welcomes-president-obama"&gt; President Obama was extended a warm Canadian welcome&lt;/a&gt; whenactivists unveiled two large banners on the Alexandra Bridgein Ottawa that read "Welcome President Obama" and "Climate Leaders Don't Buy Tar Sands".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Canada is urging that he puts climate change and energy issues at the top of his agenda during the visit. We hope the new US president will tell Prime Minister Harper that the dirtiest oil on the planet does not fit with his plan for a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning in 2008, Obama described oil as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive." If President Obama supports low-carbon fuel standards in the US he would discourage the importing of oil from tar sands. Canada is now the biggest supplier of oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

	Hazardous waste, illegitimate and dangerous new reactors and a diversion to the solutions to climate change - here's why France's picture of nuclear energy is just a 'great illusion'.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/4/flamanville2.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace in action at the construction site of the European Pressurised Reactor in Flamanville, France. Greenpeace is demanding an immediate end to construction at both Flamanville and Europe's other EPR site at Olkiluoto, Finland, calling the plants dangerous, unnecessary and uneconomic.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the French government's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) as cheap and safe, nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity, and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever-increasing problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has recently uncovered evidence that nuclear waste from the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) - the flagship of the French nuclear industry - will be up to &lt;strong&gt;seven times more hazardous&lt;/strong&gt; than waste produced by existing nuclear reactors, increasing costs and the danger to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming evidence was buried away in the &lt;a href="http://www.posiva.fi/publications/Posiva_YVA_selostusraportti_en_lukittu.pdf"&gt; environmental impact assessment report&lt;/a&gt; from Posiva, the company responsible for managing waste at the world's first EPR under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland, and in &lt;a href="http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e_ntb04-08.pdf"&gt; EU-funded research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expensive and hazardous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR is designed to extract more energy from nuclear fuel than any commercially operating reactor in order to maximise electricity output. This "high burn-up" method causes the amount of readily-released radioactive substances in spent fuel to increase disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of the hazardous waste will be more costly for a range of reasons - including an increase in the repository size due to the greater distance needed between canisters, more extensive and longer-term monitoring being necessary, and increased security being required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…not only will spent nuclear fuel produced by the EPR be more dangerous than is acknowledged by the French nuclear industry, but also storage and disposal will be more expensive than the industry and governments proclaim and will increase the overall cost of nuclear energy. The French nuclear companies Areva and EDF, which aggressively market the EPR as safe and cheap, have completely ignored the implications of the increased &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;hazards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Large, independent nuclear consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No appropriate waste facilities exist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- or are even being planned - in Finland, France or any of the countries considering buying the EPR (including the UK, the US, Canada and India). In Finland, plans for burying the nuclear waste that are awaiting approval are simply inadequate for preventing interim and long-term health risks, and will pass on huge financial liabilities to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Illegitimate and dangerous"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPR construction project in Olkiluoto has been &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/epr-the-french-reactor/"&gt; hampered by all manner of chronic problems, delays and cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposed to have been completed by April 2009, but now faces at least three years' delay - its cost has doubled to over €5 billion and serious construction and safety problems have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same mistakes have plagued a second EPR construction at Flamanville, France, which started just over a year ago. It too is now delayed - by nine months at present - and is already running at over 20 percent of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, President Sarkozy &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/illegitimate-and-dangerous-reactor-300109/"&gt; announced last week that a new EPR is to be built in Penly&lt;/a&gt;, France. Greenpeace believes that building yet another reactor under these circumstances is entirely illegitimate and simply dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penly decision was taken without any public consultation, open bidding or analysis of energy needs. No other options, such as energy efficiency or renewable energy potential, were considered, no comparisons were made in terms of costs, environmental impacts or needs; in fact, the official study analysing France's electricity needs beyond 2020 is still ongoing, so there is nothing to justify the decision to pour vast amounts of money into building another problematic reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its only justification is to provide a massive contract to the state-owned industry. In these times of fiscal crisis, however, it is crucial to make the right choices: and investment instead in renewable energy would provide not only climate protection and cleaner energy, but more and better jobs and a truly sustainable state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The great illusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when France is setting itself up as the political and industrial champion of a supposed worldwide expansion of nuclear power, Global Chance - an  association that includes among its members several of France's few independent nuclear experts - has produced a report that shows how France's nuclear promises are a dangerous illusion. France is locked into nuclear power in a way that presents an obstacle to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Chance report shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France's nuclear programme fails to rise to the challenges of climate change and energy security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France has not benefited economically from their 'all electric, all nuclear' approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how nuclear power is liable to suffer serious accidents - whether due to system failure, natural disaster or deliberate attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how no satisfactory solution has been found for the management of long-term waste; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how France contributes to proliferation, which remains a major risk for global security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace briefing &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/frances-nuclear-failures-report/"&gt; &lt;em&gt;France's Nuclear Failures - The great illusion of nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; summarises the lessons that can be drawn from the Global Chance report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy [R]evolution!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is nothing more than an out-of-date, expensive and failed technology from the last century. It undermines the solutions to climate change by diverting urgently-needed resources away from the true renewable and energy-efficiency solutions that governments who are serious about climate change need to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's &lt;a href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/"&gt;Energy [R]evolution blueprint&lt;/a&gt; shows that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency can deliver half the world's energy needs by 2050 and ensure that people have a clean energy future that is free from the dangers of hazardous nuclear waste.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Undercover operation exposes illegal dumping of e-waste in Nigeria </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/e-waste-nigeria180209/</url><text>
	Following a three-year undercover investigation, we’ve shown once again that electronic waste - like your old TV set - still isn't being responsibly recycled like it's supposed to be. Instead, e-waste is being disguised as second-hand goods and shipped off to Nigeria, where it is sold, scrapped or illegally dumped. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/european-e-waste-arrives-illeg.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            E-waste is one of the fastest growing types of hazardous waste with up to 80 percent of e-waste from Europe failing to be disposed of safely
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover operation, carried out with the help of &lt;a title="Sky News" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Sky-Probe-Reveals-Recycling-Scandal-As-Broken-TVs-Are-Shipped-Over-To-West-Africa/Article/200902315224628?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15224628_Sky_Probe_Reveals_Recycling_Scandal_As_Broken_TVs_Are_Shipped_Over_To_West_Africa"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt;, is further evidence of the growing trade in hazardous waste from Europe to the developing world due to  electronic companies' failure to take responsibility for recycling their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on a tip-off, we launched our operation to see just where some electronic waste was ending up. We took an unfixable TV, fitted it with a tracking device and brought it to the UK's Hampshire County Council for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being safely dismantled in the UK or Europe, like it should have been, the Council's 'recycling' company, BJ Electronics, passed it on as 'second-hand goods' and it was shipped off to Nigeria to be sold or scrapped and dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following the e-waste trail - a Greenpeace investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's illegal to export broken electronic goods under EU legislation - at no point before it was crammed into a container with similar TVs and shipped off was the TV turned on or tested to see if it was in working condition. We followed the complete e-waste trafficking route by hiding a tracking device inside the TV that provided location updates via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2009/02/illegal_ewaste_export_to_niger.html"&gt; Read more&lt;/a&gt; about how exactly we tracked the TV all the way to Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, like &lt;a title="Ghana" href="/international/en/news/features/poisoning-the-poor-electroni/"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Pakistan" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/photosvideos/greenpeace-photo-essays/scrap-life-pakistan-with-rob"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="India" href="/international/en/publications/reports/recyclingelectronicwasteindiachinafull/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="China" href="/international/en/news/features/illegal-e-waste-exposed140708/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, is just one of many destinations that Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other developed countries are using as toxic e-waste dumping grounds. For years, we've been exposing the mountains of e-waste that show up on the doorstep of developing countries at the expense of people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest people, in many cases children, are put to work breaking apart TVs, mobile phones, game consoles and other electronic items that arrive in their tonnes. With no safety measures, they are exposed to highly toxic chemicals, including mercury, which damages the brain; lead, which can damage reproductive systems; and cadmium, which causes kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is your e-waste going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we were able to track the e-waste from door to door, exposing the loopholes in recycling programmes that allow illicit profits to be made by the developed world's traders by dumping their obsolete and hazardous electronics abroad instead of properly recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of old electronic goods and components leave the EU for Africa every day, despite regulations prohibiting the trade in e-waste. Some will be repaired and reused, but many are beyond repair, meaning that they will eventually be dumped in places where no facilities exist for safe recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by making sure their goods are free from hazardous components. We need them to take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that poison people and the environment across the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need companies to introduce voluntary take-back schemes and remove hazardous substances from their products so they can be recycled safely and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing evidence of the harm caused by toxic e-waste, many companies are still failing to prioritise the removal of toxic chemicals and delaying taking full responsibility for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="The Independent" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/dumped-in-africa-britain8217s-toxic-waste-1624869.html"&gt;Check out the&lt;/a&gt; coverage of the undercover investigation at The Independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/philips/write-to-philips/"&gt;Please join us and tell Philips now to simply take back and recycle its products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Victory in Greece as the Quit Coal campaign moves to Indonesia</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory_greece_quit_coal_indonesia_120209/</url><text>
	Choking children, destroyed crops and a devastated fishing industry. That's the price the local community at Cilacap in Indonesia have had to pay since a coal-fired power plant was constructed in their town. Today 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives chained themselves to the gates of the coal plant to block the transport of coal on Central Java's south coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/2/12-february-2009-cilacap-cent.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace takes direct action to expose the true cost of coal at Cilacap coal plant on Central Java’s south coast. 40 Greenpeace activists and local community representatives, wearing white masks to symbolise the health risks to local communities, chained themselves to the gates of the Cilacap coal plant. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is in response to the Indonesian Minister of Energy's decision to build or expand 35 more coal-fired plants in the next 2 years - including doubling the size of the Cilacap plant. The activists are determined that, rather than devastate more communities and fuel global warming with coal power, Indonesia should embrace its potential in geothermal, solar and wind energy, and &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Indonesia Energy Revolution" href="http://www.energyblueprint.info/484.0.html" target="_blank"&gt;choose for an energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what has just happened in Greece where, following a six-month long Quit Coal campaign by Greenpeace, the Greek Minister of Development has stated that the government is not considering hard coal or nuclear power as part of Greece's energy future. Instead the Greek government will be rewriting its Long-Term Energy Plan to exclude coal and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of future Indonesia needs to choose. Along with allies including KAM Cilacap, JATAM, Walhi and Sekolah Demokrasi Ekonomi we have launched a campaign against building new, and expanding existing, coal-fired power plants in Indonesia. The first step is the launch of an Indonesian version of our &lt;a title="The True Cost of Coal" href="/international/en/publications/reports/true-cost-of-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;True Cost of Coal Report&lt;/a&gt;, which spells out the real costs of coal power - over 350 billion euro a year in environmental and health costs; costs that are borne by communities like Cilacap rather than utilities like PT Segara Sumber Prima who operate the planet in Cilacap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions like those being taken in Greece and Indonesia will have a global impact. In December this year, world leaders have their best chance to avoid run-away climate change at the UN talks in Copenhagen. As countries like Greece choose for an energy revolution the chance of a good deal rises, but if nations like Indonesia lock themselves into a future of pollution the challenge becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quit Coal Tour- Greece, October 2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Greenpeace's Quit Coal Tour" href="/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/europe-quit-coal/" target="_blank"&gt;took the clear message to Quit Coal  to 11 Mediterranean and European countries&lt;/a&gt;, including Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the campaign began, four new coal-fired power plants were planned in Greece. Following a &lt;a title="Time for Greece to give up its dirty habit" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/time_for_greece_to_give_up_its.html#more" target="_blank"&gt;campaign against the first&lt;/a&gt;, we met with the prospective owner and &lt;a title="Victory! Coal gets the boot in Greece" href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/10/coal_gets_the_boot_in_the_gree.html" target="_blank"&gt;convinced him to drop the plan&lt;/a&gt;. We also hosted the two main opposition parties in Greek politics on board the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, where both agreed to quit coal if they came to office. Now that determination has reached the government and Greece can look forward to a cleaner future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>First fin whales killed in Iceland </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/first-fin-whales-killed-in-ice/</url><text>
	The whaling boat Hvalur 9 dragged two massive fin whales up to the ancient whaling station ramp at Hvalförður in the early hours. If it were not for Iceland’s midnight sun the whalers would have been sneaking in under the cover of the night – a scene befitting the shameful hunt that can only do untold damage to Iceland’s reputation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/june-19-2009-hvalfjordur-fjor-6.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            June 19, 2009 HVALFJORDUR-FJORD, ICELANDWhaling in Iceland. First fin whales brought to land on June 19, 2009. The boat, Hvalur 9, entering Hvalfjordur-fjord. The first fin whale to be cut was a female, 18 metres long.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales were killed on Friday morning, just days before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings begin in Madeira, Portugal. The start of the hunt was clearly intended to deride efforts to modernise the Commission and stop the needless slaughter of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whales are the first of 150 fin whales Icelandic whaler Kristjan Loftsson plans to hunt this year, despite having no domestic market for the meat and &lt;a href="/international/en/press/releases/2009/no-market-for-icelandic-whale/"&gt; no interest from importers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The hunt is part of a 5 year whaling programme agreed by the former Icelandic government, just hours before it collapsed earlier this year. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists fin whales as an endangered species globally that requires special protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland's new government "fallen asleep" on the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland's new government under Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir has openly voiced its opposition to whaling. Yet, by failing to stop the hunt it appears to have fallen asleep on the issue and allowed the whalers to dictate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has not only failed to stop the controversial fin whale hunt from going ahead. It is also failing to stop a hunt of minke whales that started in May. Shockingly, the minkes are being hunted in the same areas as those visited by whale watching trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not taking action to stop the hunts, the new government risks squandering a real chance to save Iceland's environmental and international reputation, as well as hopes for speedy accession to the pro-conservation Europe Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No market for whale meat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no domestic whale meat market in Iceland. Loftsson justifies the hunt by promising to sell the meat to Japan, claiming it can help Iceland recover from its economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently showed that this is absolute hogwash, when we released audio and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/fact-sheet-the-whale-meat-mar/"&gt; an English transcript&lt;/a&gt; of a very interesting conversation we had with the Japanese trader who imported fin and minke whale meat from Iceland and Norway last year. The head of the Asia Trading Company in Tokyo told us very clearly that he will not take any more in the future, because there is no market for the whale meat in Japan. In fact, he only took it last year as a favour to Loftsson because he is a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iceland hunt starts on eve of IWC meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fin whale hunt has started just before the IWC meets in Madeira, Portugal. The blatant disregard displayed by the Icelandic whalers for international agreements, economics and the environment is a prime example of why the IWC needs to put its own house in order and become an effective conservation body that works for whales, not whalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madeira is a perfect setting for such change. In 1981, Portugal moved to protect all whales and dolphins throughout its territories, ending the island's long association with whaling. Madeira's fast-growing whale watching industry proves once again that whales are worth much more alive than dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icleand is well positioned to follow this example. More than 115,000 people have already taken our Iceland Pledge, saying they would visit the country, and go whale watching, if the government ends whaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="~/link/d65e0c9134ba47f382c627f685a3589f.aspx?epslanguage=en-GB"&gt;Tell Iceland's government to save the whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/"&gt;Help keep us fighting for whales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Cattle ranching biggest driver of Amazon deforestation</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/cattle-mapping/</url><text>
	At the World Social Forum in Belém in the heart of the Amazon we’ve released evidence confirming cattle ranching to be the biggest driver of Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace Brazil has produced a series of maps which show in greater detail than ever before the direct links between cattle ranching and forest destruction in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/1/between-1990-and-2003-brazil.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Between 1990 and 2003, Brazil’s cattle herd more than doubled from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps have been released as part of our &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/brazil-ship-tour150109/"&gt; "Save the Planet - Now!"&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian ship tour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world's fourth biggest climate polluter, and 75 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation. The Brazilian government has made promises to tackle destruction of the Amazon as part of its climate commitments, but its plans to expand the cattle industry contradict these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maps produced using innovative techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Amazon team used specialised techniques to analyse and compare satellite images of vegetation (or lack of) on the ground, and data showing the growth of infrastructure, such as roads and agribusiness. It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way. Our maps in the report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/"&gt; Amazon cattle footprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="mato grasso" href="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/googleearth/GreenpeaceLand%20Use2007MatoGrosso.kmz"&gt;&lt;img src="/international/PageFiles/25059/downladgoogleearth.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Mato Grosso because it is area of the Amazon with the highest rates of deforestation. It is also where the cattle industry is largest - there are well over 25 million cows in the region, and 7 of the 10 biggest cities in the Amazon producing cattle and cattle products are found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="actions"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="Mato Grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/location-of-mato-grosso-in-the/"&gt;Location of Mato Grasso in the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="deforestation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/deforestation-in-the-brazilian/"&gt;Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="cattle ranching expansion" href="/international/en/publications/reports/cattle-ranching-expansion-in-t/"&gt;Cattle ranching expansion in the Brazilian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="original vegatation" href="/international/en/publications/reports/original-vegetation-in-thestat/"&gt;Original Vegetation in the State of Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="slauterhouses and roads in mato grasso" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughterhouses-and-roads-in-m/"&gt;Slaughterhouses and Roads in Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="land use and slauterhouses" href="/international/en/publications/reports/land-use-and-slaughterhouses-i/"&gt;Land Use and Slaughterhouses in Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plans to expand cattle industry undermines Brazil's commitment to tackle deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forests are carbon sinks. When they are logged the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Tropical forest destruction is responsible for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire international transport sector. Deforestation in Brazil makes the country the world's fourth biggest climate polluter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests. As world leaders prepare for the most important climate negotiations ever, taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of the year, we need to see commitments from industrialised countries that pay as much attention to saving the world's rainforests as they have done to bailing out fat cat bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has promised to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/03/forests-brazil-amazon-carbon-emissions"&gt; tackle deforestation&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate commitments. But, as our maps clearly show, unless it stops expansion of the cattle industry in the Amazon, there is no chance that it can live up to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero deforestation by 2015 we've got the solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have a fighting chance against climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak by 2015, and then start to fall dramatically. That means halting deforestation completely by 2015 in the Amazon. But, even without its plans to expand the cattle industry, the Brazilian government's promises to tackle Amazon deforestation are not strong enough. The plan aims to reduce deforestation by 72 percent by 2017. This is a good start but it's not enough. It misses the 2015 deadline, and will not halt deforestion. Luckily we've got the solution - working together with Brazilian NGOs we produced a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/Amazon-7-years070904"&gt; "zero-deforestation" plan&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions urgently needed to protect rainforests and save the climate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that halving deforestation will cost anywhere from €15-25 billion annually. It is not just the Brazilian government's responsibility to protect our climate by protecting our rainforests.

&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/forests/forest-for-climate-petition/"&gt;For the sake of biodiversity, indigenous peoples' rights and the climate, I support Greenpeace's call to cut emissions – not trees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We don't accept funds from governments or corporations, but we've been able to support projects like this thanks to individual donations from people like you. Please give what you can to keep Greenpeace Amazon in action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Polish Prime Minister takes step towards EU leadership at UN Climate Summit</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/TuskCopenhagen04062009/</url><text>
	You asked and Poland answered. More than 16,000 of you have taken action and demanded that world leaders personally attend the UN Climate Summit in December. Today, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the meeting in Copenhagen by agreeing to attend the summit himself.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/7/julia-michalak-climate-campai.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk became the first Head of State to respond directly to our call for world leaders to attend the UN Climate Summit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists took the demand of world leaders to the Central and Eastern Europe Heads of States meeting in Cracow, demanding a "Time for Solidarity for climate now" on the 20th anniversary of the first free election in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity was an independent labour union at the center of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and considered to be primary catalyst of Poland's move away from communism and towards its EU membership and democracy. Activists in Poland called on governments to step up and now show solidarity with developing countries who are already suffering the most from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called on him to take personal responsibility and agree to attend the UN Climate Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US lets Poland take the lead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tusk responded directly to the call by coming right out and accepting a copy of our &lt;a title="Copenhagen Demands" href="/international/en/publications/reports/climate-demands-short/"&gt;Copenhagen Demands&lt;/a&gt;, shaking hands with our Climate campaigner Julia Michalak, and agreeing to show up for the UN meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel, who are set to meet tomorrow in Germany to discuss climate change. This is the perfect opportunity for the US and Germany to show they are serious about climate change solutions, to take personal responsibility for ensuring a good deal at the UN Climate Summit in December by committing to be there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate deal negotiated in December must ensure developed countries take the necessary steps to cut emissions, tackle climate change as well as ensure that developing countries can continue to grow their economies in a sustainable way. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that developed nations must collectively achieve emissions cuts of at least 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80-95 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for governments of developed countries to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis and to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must join Prime Minister Tusk, clear their calendars and show up at the UN meeting to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace – Yes Men spoof newspaper declares climate deal </title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/iht-se/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Readers of a free copy of the International Herald Tribune in Brussels today may have done a double take when they saw headlines like “Markets Soar on News of Copenhagen Climate Deal” and “Atmosphere Named World Heritage Site.”  That’s because the newspaper, datelined six months into the future, was brought to them by Greenpeace and the Yes Men. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/6/greenpeace-distributes-35-000.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace distributes 35,000 copies of spoof International Herald Tribune in Brussels.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the folks over at the International Herald Tribune, we created the hopeful hoax and distributed 50,000 copies of the paper outside of metro stops and street cafes in major cities from New York to Beijing to Brussels. (Along with a complimentary copy and a bottle of champagne to the chief editor of the real International Herald Tribune) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline read "Heads of State Agree Historic Climate Saving Deal."  So maybe we haven't actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; our leaders stand up and take responsibility for leading the global community in the fight to a climate deal; we can't help but ask ourselves "Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of journalists gathering in the European Council building in Brussels were audibly chuckling as they awaited the news of the real outcome of discussions today, concerning how much money, if any, the EU will be putting on the table to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.  According to the fictitious paper, the breakthrough moment enabling the December 2009 climate deal came today, when EU leaders broke the negotiation deadlock and agreed "US$ 50 billion (Euro 35 billion) for climate protection measures in developing countries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can't change the science? Change the politics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is an optimistic fairy tale of how our leaders set aside their national interests and work together to save the climate.  It's a story made of  satire and hope, about how civil society forced a new direction, and politicians responded to public protests around the globe demanding that world leaders do the right thing for the planet.  It tells the inspiring story of a climate deal that forced ambitious cuts in global carbon emissions, an end to deforestation and a fund for climate protection measures in the developing world.  It's a story that we want to come true, and a story you, dear reader, can &lt;a title="Take Action" href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;help make happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the paper &lt;a title="IHT-SE" href="http://iht.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the &lt;a title="iht-se" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/binaries/2009/6/iht-se.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less talk, more action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is not so good. Negotiators are leaving meeting after meeting with little or no progress towards a climate deal that tackles climate change. The science demands that, as a group, developed countries  cut emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. So far they have offered - at most - 15 percent. Unless they raise their game considerably over the next six months, the world will be heading for a global temperature rise of 3° C and the distinct possibility of runaway climate change, and irreversible climate impacts.  World leaders need to take charge and stop the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to warn against inaction. The public continues to demand action. But so far we haven't seen any. In December, 15,000 assorted politicians, negotiators, journalists, observers, caterers and cleaners will set up camp in the Copenhagen Bellacentre for the two-week Climate Summit. We expect world leaders to also be there, acting in our name and taking responsibility for our future. The international deal that saves the climate doesn't just have to be a headline in a spoof newspaper, it can be the real thing delivered by our Heads of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't carry on like this and still hope to get the outcome the planet needs at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Something has to change. Take action now and demand that Heads of State show up and be part of the climate deal that will dictate the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just recieved a correction - and sadly it's not good news. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Not Actually Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate of Planet Back in the Balance as EU Leaders fail to deliver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of yesterday’s special edition wish to correct stories appearing on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of yesterday’s 8 page special. It appears that European leaders failed to pledge funds to help the developing world address climate change at the heads of state meeting on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a climate saving deal was not agreed in Copenhagen as reported in this paper. The IHT regrets the error. We also regret any premature celebrations our publication may have triggered among lovers of polar bears, coral reefs, tropical forests, the billion people now once again likely to suffer water shortages in the next decades,  and everyone else on the planet, who now face an impoverished and chaotic future as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a printing error, the quote from Greenpeace responding to the meeting conclusion was mistakenly edited out of the story. The statement should have read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls upon the citizens of the world to hold the EU heads of State personally accountable for this failure, and to get out into the streets to demand with the loudest voice ever raised on Earth that our leaders lead, so that the fictitious vision of a world saved from global warming which the International Herald Tribune mistakenly described might in fact become a reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHT regrets the omission. The IHT does not, however, regret reporting that Silvio Berlusconi was suffering from hug related injuries. That part was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;Tell Obama of the US, Hu of China, Brown of the UK, Merkel of Germany, Sarkozy of France, and Lula of Brazil that they must clear their calendars and show up at the UN Climate Summit to secure the future of the planet, and take personal action to get us out of this mess.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The six Greenpeace activists who shut down a coal power station last year made history when a UK jury agreed that they were acting to safeguard property from the impacts of climate change. A new documentary takes you behind the scenes of that action, and into the heart of what Greenpeace and non-violent direct action is all about.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Six people who made a choice to act against climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six were accused of causing £30,000 of criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station.  Their defence of "&lt;a href="/international/blog/climate/kingsnorth-six-day-one-20080901"&gt;lawful excuse&lt;/a&gt;" was accepted by the jury, which supported the right to take direct action to protect the climate from the burning of coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times listed the defence as one of the ideas that defined 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their story, internationally acclaimed director Nick Broomfield has just completed a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;20 minute film&lt;/a&gt; about the action and the court case, celebrating the spirit of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-violent direct action: what makes us Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingsnorth Six case is but the latest chapter in the Greenpeace story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has stood at the forefront of the environmental movement as a catalyst for positive and durable change for nearly four decades. In 1971 we lived in a world where atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were routine, where whales were being hunted to extinction for profit, where toxic and radioactive waste were poured freely into the seas, where forests and wilderness were destroyed with barely a murmur of protest, and where the morality of environmental destruction was rarely raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2hZKX6WSCg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/atimecomes-video"&gt;See the full movie of our Kingsnorth Six victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists made a difference to each of those issues in the same way the Kingsnorth Six did: by taking calculated personal risks to stand up for what they believed was right, even if the law told them they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journeys into the bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace founders were the first.  They hired an old fishing boat with the intention to &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/"&gt; sail directly into a nuclear testing exclusion zone to stop the detonation of a nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Although the ship was turned back by the US military and the bomb went off, the Greenpeace  act of defiance catalyzed a movement, and subsequent nuclear testing that was planned at Amchitka was cancelled five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/moruroa-journey-into-the-bomb/"&gt; David McTaggart took his 38-foot ketch, Vega, into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa&lt;/a&gt;, the Pacific atoll where the French government tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Having been given an order to leave, McTaggart and his crew were expecting to be boarded and physically removed from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the test device was raised over Moruroa on a helium balloon,  it appeared that a decision had been made to simply detonate the bomb - protesters be damned. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/photosvideos/audios/david-mctaggart-audio-diary-on"&gt; McTaggart recorded an audio message for his friends and family&lt;/a&gt; and after the crew secured the ship as best they could against the expected nuclear fallout, they sent the following radio telegram to their Vancouver base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"BALLOON RAISED OVER MORUROA LAST NIGHT STOP GREENPEACE THREE SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST STOP SITUATION FRIGHTENING PLEASE PRAY AND ACT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, McTaggart's ship was rammed by French commandos who then boarded the Vega and detained all of the crew. But McTaggart was relentless and returned to Moruroa in 1973, infuriating the French military so much that he and his crew were brutally beaten by commandos. McTaggart was hospitalized and almost lost the sight in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McTaggart and his crew had achieved exactly what they had set out to do. They had brought worldwide attention, and further embarrassment, to the French government. McTaggart pursued the French government in their own courts, eventually winning his own landmark case.  With the entire Pacific united in outrage and opposition, the French finally relented by moving its weapons testing programme underground.  Continued protest eventually led to the end of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/international/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/25013/greenpeace-vessel-vega-boarded.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The story continues in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Greenpeace activists still await the conclusion of their story, and their court case. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki face &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-scandal/"&gt; ten years in prison for the crime of exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry&lt;/a&gt;. The two turned over to police a box of whale meat, which had been disguised as "cardboard" and removed from a whaling ship, as evidence of widespread embezzlement. But instead of an investigation of the scandal and the contradictory statements made by the bureaucrats that oversee the taxpayer-funded programme, police arrested Junichi and Toru and raided the Greenpeace offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International expressed grave concern about the case, and 250,000 people have demanded the release of Junichi and Toru and investigation of the real criminals. In a country with little sympathy for civil disobedience, Junichi and Toru have braved the condemnation of society in the name of their beliefs. The trial is expected to conclude later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imperative to act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add to the stories of these individuals the scores of people who took action with Greenpeace: who manoeuvred boats beneath platforms to &lt;a href="/international/PageFiles/25013/OsparFinal.pdf"&gt;keep radioactive waste barrels from being dumped in the sea&lt;/a&gt;; who overwintered in &lt;a href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/98/antarctic/"&gt;Antarctica to keep oil companies out&lt;/a&gt;; who put their bodies between a harpoon and a whale to demand a &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/campaign-history/"&gt; moratorium on commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;; who waded into outflows to demand an &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/detox/toxic-trade/"&gt; end to trade in toxic waste&lt;/a&gt;; who occupied the &lt;a href="/international/en/about/history/the-brent-spar/"&gt; Brent Spar oil rig to keep it from being scuttled&lt;/a&gt;; who chained themselves to bulldozers to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"&gt; protect the Great Bear Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;; and who whooped and hollered and celebrated when the world eventually came to its senses and agreed that they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we have clocked up &lt;a href="/international/en/about/victories/"&gt;an extensive list of victories&lt;/a&gt; - the threat of runaway climate change threatens all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons to act now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Greenpeace is the story of individuals. People like the Kingsnorth Six, like David McTaggart, like Junichi and Toru, and people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in this world is made up of a cascading series of individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time comes when each of us has to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Ask world leaders to take individual responsibility, and personally attend the UN climate summit this year to ensure a meaningful deal is set to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;

<item><language>en</language><title>Major brands implicated in Amazon destruction</title><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/amazoncattle01062009/</url><text>
	Just as protecting the world’s forests is rapidly becoming a recognized necessity for fighting climate change, we have discovered that major fashion, food and sports brand names are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/international/ReSizes/Small/Global/international/planet-2/image/2009/5/cattle-report.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cattle industry is the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil’s main source of CO2 emissions.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our  three-year investigation into Brazil's booming cattle industry - the largest source of deforestation in the world and Brazil's main source of CO2 emissions - has found that some of the brands that we all know and love could be implicated in the widespread deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The investigation also uncovers how the Brazilian government is bankrolling the destruction and is undermining its own efforts to tackle the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Greenpeace report &lt;a title="Cattle Report" href="/international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughtering the Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks beef, leather and other cattle products from ranches involved in illegal deforestation, invasion of indigenous lands and slavery in Brazil back to the supply chains of top brands such as Adidas/Reebok, Timberland, Geox, Carrefour, Eurostar, Honda, Gucci, IKEA, Kraft, Clarks, Nike, Tesco and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators found that the Brazilian government has a vested interest in the further expansion of the cattle industry; it part-owns three of the country's cattle giants - Bertin, JBS and Marfrig - which are responsible for fuelling the destruction of huge tracts of the Amazon. That's right; the Amazon rainforest is being wiped out to make room for the beef in your TV dinner and the leather on your sneakers.  Humans rights abuses, deforestation and climate change seem to us like a pretty big price to pay for the trainers we put on before our morning run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lula's loopholes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President Lula's government forecasts that the country's share of the global beef market will double by 2018. 2018 seems to be a big year for the Brazilian government as it also claims this is the year by which it will have cut deforestation by 72 percent. The expansion of the cattle sector threatens to undermine the government's ability to fulfill its pledge. Brazil is the fourth largest climate polluter in the world, with the majority of its climate emissions coming from the clearance and burning of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle, President Lula's government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis," said Andre Muggiati, Greenpeace Brazil, Amazon campaigner. "If it wants to be part of the climate solution, Lula's government must get out of bed with cattle industry, and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation. Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for developed world governments to provide USD 140 billion a year to tackle the climate crisis, to fund both mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries. Approximately USD 40 billion a year of this should be designated to forest protection. The funds would be provided in return for a commitment to stop deforestation by 2015 in the Amazon and globally by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World leaders must take personal responsibility to agree strong global deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world's entire transport sector, so any deal must effectively tackle deforestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.action-pact.org/"&gt;At this year's UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen world leaders need to agree on the funding required to end deforestation. Tell them to personally attend the Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation. We do not accept any money from governments or corporations. Please give what you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Just two weeks after our exposé 'Slaughtering the Amazon' showed how the Brazilian cattle industry is decimating the Amazon rainforest, we are seeing a stampede as companies and the World Bank start to sever their links with the slaughterhouses and farms involved.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Cattle ranching is the primary driver of forest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon, with 79.5 percent of deforested land used for cattle pastures.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;News is just out that the World Bank has cancelled its loan to
Brazilian cattle giant, Bertin. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private lending arm of the World Bank,
withdrew a USD 90 million loan to Bertin. The loan - intended for
the company to further expand into the Amazon region - would only
lead to more rainforest destruction and fuel global climate change.
The last USD 30 million hand-out from the IFC will no longer be
given and it is anticipated that the IFC will ask for the USD 60
million it has already invested to be returned earlier than
previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good news that the World Bank is withdrawing these funds,
yet scandalous that it was feeding a company that causes Amazon
deforestation and climate change in the first place," said Paulo
Adario, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon campaign director. "For a bank
that portrays itself as the 'knowledge bank', this was a very
ill-conceived and thoroughly destructive use of its resources. It
must now guarantee that it will not invest in such damaging
projects in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about the brands?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian retailers have also reacted to our investigation. The
three biggest supermarket chains in Brazil - Carrefour, Wal-Mart
and Pão de Açúcar - said they will suspend all trade in cattle
products from farms involved in deforestation in a key area of the
Amazon. We have yet to see such a positive reaction from the big
brands in the US and Europe, which were also implicated in our
report - among them, Nike, Adidas, Clarks and Geox and several
well-known supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Brazil, there have also been some legal moves. Prior to
the release of our report, a federal prosecutor in Pará State filed
a billion dollar lawsuit against 20 farms and 10 cattle companies,
as well as Bertin. Under the law suit, offending farms will be
fined for environmental damage and their operations suspended in
areas of forest that have been destroyed illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch this space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are moving fast - and not all the news is good news. The
Brazilian government still refuses to get out of bed with the
powerful agribusiness industry. Environment Minister Carlos Minc,
who has praised our report and said he agrees with our
recommendations, is under fire from the agribusiness bosses, who
are circulating a petition calling for his removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while President Lula talks the talk at the international
climate negotiations, he has yet to prove he will take the
leadership required to help protect us from climate change by
protecting the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, the Brazilian Congress passed legislation which
wasoriginally intended to legalise the land-holdings of small
settlers, butthey changed it to include provisions that benefited
medium-to-large landgrabbers and business interests. The law will
privatise ownership of up to67 million hectares of the Amazon
rainforest, land that has been occupiedillegally. This is an area
bigger than Norway and Germany combined, and putsAmazon protection
in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula can still stop the worst parts of this bad legislation
going through. Whether or not he does so will indicate whether
history will remember him as one of the leaders who averted runaway
climate change or one of the losers that brought it on. Forests are
a vital defence against global climate change. Any effective deal
to save the climate must include a deal to protect forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lula needs to veto the worst articles of this law and
commit to zero deforestation. In return, rich countries must dig
deep and fund forest protection in Brazil, Indonesia and other
forested countries. We also need Lula and all other Heads of State
to take personal responsibility for securing an effective climate
deal by attending the Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December and
taking immediate action to guarantee a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/take-action-write-to-lula"&gt;Tell President Lula to veto the worst articles of this law, commit to zero deforestation and to personally attend the UN Climate Summit and ensure that deforestation is halted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support our work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/en/supportus/"&gt;We rely on donations from individuals like you in order to continue fighting climate change and deforestation.

	How many light bulbs can 1 billion people change? About 400 million wasteful incandescent bulbs, in India’s case. Today, India has put in place a market mechanism that will phase out incandescent bulbs, making way for a cleaner energy future. The Bachat Lamp Yojana programme will replace 400 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million tonnes of CO2 each year. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/international/Global/international/planet-2/image/2007/5/activists-hang-a-banner-from-t.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            New Delhi, 2007: Activists asking for a phasing out of inefficient light bulbs in India by 2010.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in several countries, and, this decision puts India in the company of other countries leading on light bulbs legislation, Australia, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/" target="_blank"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/news/features/argentina-ban-the-bulb-140308/" target="_blank"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly amazing how big the savings can be from strong action on energy efficiency. With this decision, India will be cutting the same amount of emissions that would come from four coal-fired power plants. If the whole world followed India's lead, eliminating wasted electricity from lighting, the cumulative effect would be equivalent to shutting down around 220 coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, India has used a mechanism set up under the Kyoto protocol to bring down the cost of compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for ordinary people. The more efficient bulbs were previously 80 - 100 rupees and will now be only 15 rupees, the same price as an incandescent bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes via the cleaner development mechanism (CDM), effectively a way for developed nations to fund emissions reductions in developing nations. This programme sets an example of how nations can work together now to cut emissions, but a much bigger deal is needed urgently to stop runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's best chance for real action is at the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in December. There, industrialised countries must agree to fund around USD 140 billion a year to help economies in the developing world cut emissions, protect tropical forests and adapt to the effects of climate change. Of course, countries too must implement tough domestic targets to ensure that global greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak by 2015, and start declining rapidly thereafter, reaching zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, lighting makes up 20 per cent of all residential electricity consumption, so this is a good first step. We congratulate the Indian government, and hope it is going to carry out more actions in its plan, along with targets and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a really smart way to reduce demand and reduce CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions quickly, but it is only one half of the solution to climate change. The other is to quit coal and to replace it with non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and solar - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dLHZ6jKFc&amp;amp;eurl=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution"&gt; a real energy revolution&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's rapid pace of development means its CO&lt;span style="font-size: 70%"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions are going up. It also faces peak power shortages even now, so a clean energy revolution will deliver big solutions to these big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
