&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Peace and Disarmament&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Make no mistake; nuclear weapons are a problem today. There are approximately 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world, belonging to nine countries: US, Russian Federation, UK, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. More than one thousand five hundred of them ready to launch at a moment's notice, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace volunteers fly peace doves for the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some may consider them an unfortunate relic from the Cold War, the truth is that the nuclear weapons states are clinging to them as hard as they can, reinventing new roles and designs for them, and recently even proposals for "smaller useable" weapons. And all this despite plenty of speeches, promises and legally binding treaties toget rid of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the devestating impacts of the nuclear bombs on the cities and peoples of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests have left a legacy of global and regional contamination. People living near the test sites have suffered from cancers, still births, miscarriages and other health effects -- and are still suffering today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been shouting about nuclear dangers for over 30 years, beginning on 15 September 1971, when a group of North American peace activists chartered an old trawler named "Phyllis Cormack" and sailed from Vancouver towards the US nuclear testing zone near Amchitka, Alaska. The Greenpeace ship and crew were arrested by the US coastguard, but the press reports about the expedition put pressure on the US government. Four months later, the US canceled the test series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we have campaigned against both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Bearing witness in test zones, supplying scientific data and measurements on human and environmental impacts and by conducting direct non-violent actions to call attention to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even the sinking of our flagship the Rainbow Warrior en route to the Moruroa test site by the French Secret Service in 1985 stopped Greenpeace's anti-nuclear activism. Since then, we have tracked plutonium and nuclear waste shipments around the globe, highlighted the dangers of reprocessing, protested against nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed warships or submarines and confronted the nuclear weapons states about their weapons programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people are with us: the majority of people and states want disarmament now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can stop the nuclear threat with the voice of the second superpower: public opinion.  And that voice is getting louder and louder. Public opinion polls conducted in nuclear and non-nuclear weapon statesshow large majorities favouring the abolition of nuclear weapons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;US:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey carried out in 1997 by Lake, Sosin and Snell said in the US found that 87% of those polled felt, "the US should negotiate anagreement to eliminate nuclear weapons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll carried out by MORI in 2005, on behalf of Greenpeace, showed a majority (54%) of the British public oppose the development of a new nuclear weapons system. Only one in three (33%) support their development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Russia: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, 61% of Russians polled by Vox Populi commissioned by TASS said, "All nuclear weapons states should eliminate such weapons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;India:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;62% of Indians polled by The Hindu in 1998 said, "India should not produce nuclear bombs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Japan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Japanese poll by Asahi Shimbun in 1998 78% agreed that, "all nuclear weapons states should eliminate such weapons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Australia: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resounding 92% of Australians polled by Roy Morgan Research Co. in 1998 agreed, "Australia should help negotiate a global treaty to ban and destroy all nuclear weapons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Norway: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly 92% of Norwegians polled in 1998 by 4 fakta A/S agreed "Norway should work actively for a ban on nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Belgium:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;72% of Belgian polled in 1998 by Market Response said they were for "an initiative on behalf of Belgium with an aim of initiating talks concerning a treaty for the abolition of nuclear weapons''.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Canada:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;93% of Canadians polled in 1998 by the Angus Reid Group agreed that, "Canada should take a leadership role in global negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Turkey:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, an Infakto poll, commissioned by Greenpeace, found that 72% of Turkish people supported the idea of making Turkey a nuclear-free zoneand 75% would support Turkey leading an international campaign for international nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every year at the United Nations when all governments vote, we see the vast majority of the 191countries voting for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Citizens in nuclear weapons states should question why their leaders feel so entitled to gamble with their lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is real. We're seeing the effects all around us - polar ice melting, sea level rising and extreme weather events. If we want to reduce the impact of climate change and have reliable energy sources, we must make changes, at a government and individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solutions to climate change and energy crises already exist - clean energy, energy efficiency and new environmentally sound technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand's work to stop climate change and provide New Zealand with reliable energy includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Defending our oceans&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Seen from space the Earth is covered in a blue mantle. It is a planet on which the continents are dwarfed by the oceans surrounding them and the immensity of the marine realm. It could be called Planet Ocean.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staggering 80 percent of all the life on Earth is to be found hidden beneath the waves and this vast global ocean pulses around our world driving the natural forces which maintain life on our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oceans provide vital sources of protein, energy, minerals and other products of use the world over and the rolling of the sea across the planet creates over half our oxygen, drives weather systems and natural flows of energy and nutrients around the world, transports water masses many times greater than all the rivers on land combined and keeps the Earth habitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the global ocean there would be no life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is gravely worrying, then, that we are damaging the oceans on a scale that is unimaginable to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that human activity can have serious impacts on the vital forces governing our planet.  We have fundamentally changed our global climate and are just beginning to understand the consequences of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As yet largely unseen, but just as serious, are the impacts we are having on the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy ocean has diverse ecosystems and robust habitats.  The actual state of our oceans is a far cry from this natural norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A myriad of human pressures are being exerted both directly and indirectly on ocean ecosystems the world over. Consequently ecosystems are collapsing as marine species are driven towards extinction and ocean habitats are destroyed.  Degraded and stripped of their diversity, ocean ecosystems are losing their inherent resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to defend our oceans because without them, life on Earth cannot exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dead oceans, dead planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to defend them now more than ever, because the oceans need all the resilience they can muster in the face of climate change and the potentially disasterous impacts this is already beginning to produce in the marine world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Defending our Oceans campaign sets out to protect and preserve our oceans now and for the future by setting aside swathes of the global oceans from exploitation and controllable human pressure, allowing these areas the respite they so desperately need for recovery and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on a protection and recovery system established to manage land based over-exploitation, Marine Reserves are the ocean equivalent of national parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine Reserves are a scientifically developed and endorsed approach to redressing the crisis in our oceans which work alongside a range of other measures designed to ensure that the demands we make of our oceans are managed sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Marine Reserves we need to tackle a great many threats to the oceans' viability and find better ways of managing their resources.  To this end, while Greenpeace campaigns for Marine Reserves, we also campaign against the acts which have brought the oceans to this point - we expose the countless pressures, reveal the threats, confront the villains and point to the solutions and measures necessary to create sustainable oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Time heals everything, doesn't it? It has been 30 years since the name Chernobyl became the infamous nuclear accident that devastated the lives of millions of people in Western Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine. Thirty years on, and the nightmare for thousands of people is still frightening.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chernobyl catastrophe released one hundred times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet many seem to just dismiss the accident as a part of history and forget what large doses of radiation actually do to human lives. Sadly, focussing solely on the disputed statistics of Chernobyl has dehumanised what happened. The effects of Chernobyl touched millions of people and thousand still endure very visible and painful effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are telling the stories of just a few of those thousands, to bring to light the reality of nuclear energy. Independent scientists and economists know that nuclear energy is the most expensive electricity source available, counting the cost of building, running and decommissioning the power stations. But an economic analysis alone cannot calculate the costs due to the damage done to our genes, the very foundation of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other costs to take into consideration - the insurance and the cost of potential accidents, the long-term disposal of waste when no reliable solution has yet been found. Nuclear power is not a solution for climate change. The massive subsidies needed to keep the nuclear industry alive are slowing and undermine the renewable energy revolution that is the real solution to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Murmansk, 8 October 2013 - The Regional Court of Murmansk today rejected an application made by lawyers for two Greenpeace International activists and a freelance photographer that they be released on bail (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A further 27 cases requesting bail will be heard later this week. Twenty-eight Greenpeace International activists, including New Zealanders Jonathan Beauchamp and David Haussmann, plus a freelance photographer and a freelance videographer were seized by Russian special forces on the ship &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; in international waters 19 days ago. Their arrests followed a peaceful protest at the Gazprom Arctic oil platform Prirazlomnaya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be no justification for the continued detention of activists who did nothing more than express their beliefs through entirely peaceful means. They have been charged with a crime that did not happen, they are being held for something nobody thinks they actually did. They are now prisoners of conscience, and as such they are the responsibility of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know why our friends remain in jail. We will not be intimidated. We will not stop peacefully challenging Gazprom's and other oil companies’ plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions in which the 30 crew, activists and freelancers have been detained during the last 19 days have on occasions violated the rights of the detainees. Their lawyers are filing complaints to the competent authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about the conditions under which our friends are being held. At the very least they should be together at the same facility, they should be warm and they should have access to basic needs. I cannot express strongly enough the admiration I have for their families, who are bearing this strain with a dignity and determination that is inspiring to people across the world,” Naidoo added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1.1 million people have sent emails to their Russian embassies and consulates demanding the immediate release of the Arctic 30.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The three people whose bail appeals were rejected are crew member Ekaterina Zaspa, activist Andrey Allakhverdov and freelance photographer Denis Sinyakov. All are Russian nationals.

	‘Heaps of people’ are expected to attend the Wellington leg of a global day of activities this Saturday calling for 28 Greenpeace activists and two photojournalists to be released from Russian jail cells.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Thirteen Greenpeace activists and a freelance video journalist have now been charged with piracy under Article 227 of the Russian Criminal Code. The maximum sentence, if convicted, is 15 years in a Russian jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The remaining members of the Arctic 30, including New Zealanders Jonathan Beauchamp and David Haussmann, are expected to appear in front of the Russian Investigative Committee in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The Wellington event will kick off at midday on Saturday outside the Russian Embassy in Karori. There will be live music and speeches from the detained activists’ families, Greenpeace, Amnesty International and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Amnesty International has demanded that the Russian authorities drop the “absurd and damaging” piracy charges (1). Over 60 other NGOs have issued statements of concern and support including&lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/30/russia-drop-piracy-charges-against-greenpeace" target="_blank"&gt; Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.christianaid.org.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/comment/greenpeace-protesters-held-by-russian-authorities.aspx" target="_blank"&gt; Christian Aid&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/press_releases/?210711/WWF-calls-for-the-immediate-release-of-greenpeace-members" target="_blank"&gt; WWF International&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.foei.org/en/what-we-do/land-grabbing/latest-news/friends-of-the-earth-international-calls-for-the-immediate-release-of-the-crew-of-the-arctic-sunrise#.UkLoBE5LzQM" target="_blank"&gt; Friends of the Earth International&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://350.org/about/blogs/statement-support-greenpeace-activists-freethearctic30" target="_blank"&gt; 350&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2013/09/sierra-club-statement-greenpeace-activists-arrested-russia" target="_blank"&gt; Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.rsf.org/russia-another-journalist-on-arctic-27-09-2013,45251.html" target="_blank"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/105976" target="_blank"&gt;Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/blog" target="_blank"&gt; Global Witness. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Earlier today Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said: “A charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;“This is an outrage and represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest. Any claim that these activists are pirates is as absurd as it is abominable. It is utterly irrational, it is designed to intimidate and silence us, but we will not be cowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, head of Greenpeace New Zealand, said: “We’re hoping heaps of people come down to the Russian Embassy this Saturday. Bring the kids, bring a picnic, listen to some music, but also stand up for some brave Kiwis who were trying to protect the fragile and fast disappearing Arctic.”&lt;/p&gt;

	 Amsterdam, September 25, 2013 - According to media reports (1), Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that the 30 Greenpeace International activists, including two New Zealanders, detained by Russian authorities after an Arctic drilling protest are ‘obviously not pirates’, but has suggested that they may have broken international laws. He made these remarks at an Arctic forum in Salekhard.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Responding, Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We welcome President Putin’s recognition that our activists are clearly not pirates and acted purely out of concern for the Arctic environment.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our climbers attempted to attach themselves to the side of the platform to raise attention to the threat of Arctic oil drilling in this fragile environment and the urgent need to deal with climate change. This was a peaceful protest against Gazprom’s ambitions to be the first company to pump oil from icy Arctic seas.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Russian authorities today released (2) new footage apparently taken from the rig itself which shows Russian security forces confronting two climbers during the protest last Wednesday. It can be viewed here:   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rFF0JTG2-Y8?rel=0" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Female climber Sini Saarela from Finland - clearly in distress - is heard shouting “I’m coming down, I’m coming down!” while armed agents recklessly pull on a safety rope used to secure her to the structure. The video then shows live rounds fired into the water by Russian security forces despite an activist on the Greenpeace boat clearly holding his hands in the air, signalling his peaceful intentions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Russian media sources also reported that Russian border guards who confronted the activists are claiming to have been unaware that the protest was carried out by Greenpeace International:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The border guard’s claim is simply not credible. Our ship bears two large rainbows, two peace doves and has Greenpeace emblazoned on each side. They followed us for over 24 hours before the protest began. We have a long history of peaceful activism in Russia and are well known to the authorities.” Naidoo added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Russia has contacted both Gazprom and Russian authorities multiple times in the past to explain the organisation’s peaceful opposition to dangerous Arctic drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All 30 activists remain under arrest near Murmansk, apparently in different locations. Five people were interviewed last night by the Investigative Committee and served papers confirming they were are being investigated for piracy offences. They have not been charged with any offences.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contacts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International press desk: +31 (0)20 718 24 70 or &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/new-zealand/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/c899bfb5de219c052742d9fedb8dbf40.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Murmansk/Moscow, 7 October, 2013 – Greenpeace International has revealed today that it intends to file a criminal complaint with the police over the illegal seizure of its ship the Arctic Sunrise.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Serious violations took place when the FSB detained the crew and the icebreaker&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;," said Alexander Mukhortov, the lawyer representing Peter Willcox, the US captain of the&lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Armed men without identification boarded the vessel while wearing masks and pointing guns at those on board. They then took control of the vessel, confiscated personal belongings and put everyone in custody without documenting any of these actions."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a press conference held in Moscow today, Greenpeace International also said it is filing complaints over the violations of the rights of the 30 detainees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In some cells it is cold and there are video cameras around the clock. Not all of those detained have access to sufficient drinking water or are able to exercise adequately," Greenpeace International lawyer Sergei Golubok said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International lawyers have also objected to the transportation of activists in police wagons. Some of those detained have been transported for 4-5 hours each way to the Murmansk court hearings in cages without food, heating or access to toilet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other developments, Greenpeace International can confirm that appeals hearings against the continued detention of the 28 activists, plus a freelancer videographer and photographer, will start&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; position: relative; top: -2px; z-index: 0;"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ" style="position: relative; top: 2px; z-index: -1;"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hearings of three Russian prisoners will take place&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; position: relative; top: -2px; z-index: 0;"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ" style="position: relative; top: 2px; z-index: -1;"&gt;on Tuesday from 9:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;local time.

It can be viewed&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="RU"&gt;&lt;a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://youtu.be/2_mQh53ZzuE" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Download details below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At today's press conference, Greenpeace International also presented worrying facts about the way in which the&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is being held.

Ubels later sent a letter to the FSB raising concerns about the ship's maintenance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Soon, if not already the generator, generating the ships electricity, will stop running. With this, also all the ships main functions will stop working, apart from the secondary system. The ship will no longer have a alarm system and common leakages of sea water into the engine room will no longer raise alarms," Ubels wrote to the head of the Investigative Committee. "I respectfully ask you to consider to allow me to take care of the ship to avoid greater damage or worst case sinking of our ship." The letter can be viewed&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="RU"&gt;&lt;a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/publications/polar/2013/Engineer%27s%20letter%20Arctic%20Sunrise.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington Event on Saturday Outside Russian Embassy
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A further 15 Greenpeace International activists and a Russian freelance photojournalist were today charged with piracy in Murmansk. This means that all 28 activists from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, as well as two freelancers, now face the charge. If convicted, the offence carries a maximum 15 year jail term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealanders Jonathan Beauchamp and David Haussmann were among those charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers acting on behalf of Greenpeace International have now lodged formal appeals in the Murmansk Lenin district court against the continued detention of the Arctic 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, ‘heaps of people’ are expected to attend the Wellington leg of a global day of activities calling for the Arctic 3028 Greenpeace activists to be released from Russian jail cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wellington event will kick off at midday on Saturday outside the Russian Embassy in Karori. There will be live music, plus speeches from the detained activists’ families, Greenpeace, Amnesty International and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Beauchamp, Jon’s mother, said: “Our Jon is a caring, practical, commonsense sort of man, and we think very brave too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s full of Kiwi ingenuity, just ideal for coping with the job he absolutely loves - looking after the little boats on the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is particularly passionate about the Arctic and the oceans and all the creatures that depend on this environment, and knows the area very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Peaceful protest is one thing, but he would never condone violent or hurtful actions in order to get the message out about the dangers of drilling for oil in such a fragile place.  The detention and the charge of piracy do seem excessive, and we hope will be reconsidered very, very soon by the Russian authorities, so they can all come home as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, head of Greenpeace New Zealand, said: “We’re hoping heaps of people come down to the Russian Embassy this Saturday. Bring the kids, bring a picnic, listen to some music, but also stand up for some brave Kiwis who were trying to protect the fragile and fast disappearing Arctic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said: “Our activists have been charged with a crime that did not happen, they are accused of an imaginary offence. There can be no doubt about why the charge of piracy has been brought and the legal hammer wielded. An effort is underway to intimidate us, but our peaceful passionate campaign against Gazprom and all other Arctic drillers will not be silenced. A profound injustice is right now being perpetrated against our friends, our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters who sit in jail. I call on people across the world to stand with us against Gazprom and all oil companies who want to drill in the Arctic, join us in this fight against bullies of the very worst kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International is taking its efforts to highlight the case, free the activists and protect the Arctic to a global level. On Tuesday night Greenpeace climbers hung a huge banner from the roof of FC Basel’s St. Jakob-Park stadium in Switzerland as the team faced Schalke in the UEFA Champions League - a tournament sponsored by Gazprom. On Wednesday all of Gazprom’s filling stations in Germany were hit by protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s event in Wellington is part of an emergency global day of solidarity. Peaceful events are planned in more than 80 cities in 45 countries across the world. In Hong Kong hundreds will gather at the main harbour to form a human banner. In South Africa people will come together at former Apartheid detention centres. In Canada large audio and visual displays will light up at an all-night event. In Madrid supporters will gather in Puerto del Sol with a replica of the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; ship. And in Senegal fishermen who last year welcomed the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; on its voyage to preserve their fishing grounds will take to their boats again in an act of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Mikhail Fedotov, the head of the Russian presidential Human Rights Council, said he sees no reason to prosecute the crew of the Arctic Sunrise for piracy (1). The council is an advisory panel established to assist President Putin in fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities to guarantee and protect human rights. Groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders have called for the release of the activists, while media outlets are increasingly highlighting their plight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28 activists, a freelance photographer and the freelance videographer, were involved in a protest against the Gazprom Arctic drilling platform &lt;em&gt;Prirazlomnaya&lt;/em&gt; on September 18th. Two activists tried to climb the side of the platform and hang a banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="box-content"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pacific plunder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
As industrial fishing fleets exhaust tuna stocks around the globe more and more are heading to the Pacific in search of a disappearing resource. There are almost 6000 vessels licensed to fish for tuna in the Pacific and in 2012 around 2.6 million tonnes of Pacific tuna were caught – that’s about 60 per cent of the world’s supply of tuna. However, overfishing means tuna stocks are being caught faster than they can replenish.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plunder of the Pacific is impacting on the health of our ocean, the future of tuna in the region and of Pacific island countries and their people which rely on the fisheries economically and as an essential source of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific bigeye and yellowfin are already in serious trouble. Two years ago scientists advised that fishing needed to be cut by up to 50 per cent to allow bigeye tuna to recover. In New Zealand we’re noticing the reduced numbers of yellowfin arriving in our coastal waters from the Pacific, especially long the east coast of the North Island. The Whakatane Sportsfishing Club has removed the word ‘tuna’ from the name of one of its annual tournaments as tuna are no longer being caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destructive fishing practices are wiping out tuna stocks as well as other marine species. The main method of catching skipjack tuna (the most common species you’ll find on supermarket shelves) is one of the worst offenders. Fishing fleets use floating death traps to attract schools of tuna - fish aggregation devices (FADs) - then scoop up everything in the area with huge purse seine nets. The indiscriminate catch includes tuna so young that they haven't had a chance to reproduce as well as unwanted species including sharks and turtles which are thrown back into the sea dead or dying. This method of using death trap FADs, along with purse seine nets, catches up to ten times more unwanted species than more sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Pirate fishing is rampant" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/blog/real-pirates-plunder-and-steal/blog/47062/" target="_blank"&gt;Pirate fishing is also rampant in high value tuna fisheries&lt;/a&gt;, literally stealing tuna from the plates of some of the poorest people in the world. Illegal fishing is estimated to cost the Pacific region up to NZ$1.7 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the legal tuna fisheries are part of the robbery. The way that foreign fishing nations and rich multinational corporations negotiate with Pacific Island countries for access to fish tuna in their waters is incredibly unfair. Only around five per cent of the value of the tuna is given to the resource owners, often denying coastal communities much-needed employment and perpetuating irresponsible fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 we launched a &lt;a title="Transforming Tuna Report" href="/new-zealand/en/reports/Transforming-Tuna-Fisheries-in-Pacific-Island-Countries/" target="_blank"&gt;report providing a blueprint for Pacific Island governments and regional bodies&lt;/a&gt; to promote a more sustainable and locally owned and operated tuna fishery in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland – Greenpeace volunteers are today holding a dawn to dusk vigil in a mock prison cell on the Auckland waterfront to mark the 30th day of detention in Russia for the Arctic 30 which includes two New Zealanders.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for the immediate release of the 28 activists plus a freelance photographer and freelance videographer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty volunteers including Nicola Beauchamp, the sister of New Zealand activist Jonathan Beauchamp, are taking turns to complete 30-minute vigils in the small prison cell on Queens Wharf. Each volunteer represents one of the Arctic 30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicola Beauchamp said her family were heartened by the thousands of people who had been involved in solidarity events for the Arctic 30 over the last month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Jon and his colleagues took a stand for us. Now we need to stand up for them,” she said&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Queens Wharf vigil is near to where the Rainbow Warrior was bombed by the French Government in 1985. Greenpeace NZ Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid, who was a crew member at the time of the bombing, was one of the first volunteers in the cell vigil. She represented the captain of the Arctic Sunrise Peter Willcox who was also the captain of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McDiarmid said similar events were being held around the world today to mark the ‘30 days of injustice’ for the Arctic 30 charged with piracy by a Russian court following a peaceful protest against Arctic oil drilling at a Gazprom oil platform in the Pechora Sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They knew that an Arctic oil spill would decimate a region of breath-taking beauty and would be almost impossible to clean up. And they knew that we can’t tackle the threat from a warming world if we burn the oil under the Arctic. We are here because peaceful activism is not a crime,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace does not put itself above the law. Those 30 brave men and women are not pirates and this charge represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amnesty International's Activism Support Manager Margaret Taylor, also at the vigil, described the piracy charges as is “absurd, unfounded and ludicrous and damaging to the rule of law."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"These charges should be dropped immediately, and there are no grounds for the activists to be held and denied bail under them. Unless there are any other reasonable and well-founded charges, the activists should be released immediately."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other vigils this morning have represented New Zealanders David Haussmann and Jonathan Beauchamp who, earlier this week, were denied bail along with 11 others. Bail hearings for the rest of the group are continuing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visitors to the Queens Wharf vigil are sending messages of support to the Arctic 30 by writing on paper doves. They are also being asked to join the 1.5 million people who have sent letters to Russian embassies demanding the release of the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, 14 October 2013 - New Zealander David Haussmann, along with the captain of the Greenpeace International ship Arctic Sunrise and one other activist, has been refused bail in Russia. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace International activists appeared this morning before a court in Murmansk. Haussmann was one of the electricians on the Arctic Sunrise when it was seized last month by armed men from the Russian security forces. The ship’s captain, American Peter Willcox, was also the captain of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985 when it was bombed by the French secret service, killing Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira. The third activist denied bail was Camila Speziale, who has joint Argentinian and Italian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court Hausmann requested that his file be updated to show that he is married and has a three-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the latest developments Peter Willcox’s wife Maggie Willcox said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; "Most people try to do at least something for the greater good, sometimes occasionally, sometimes for sustained periods. Rarely do people devote their entire life trying to make the world a better place. Peter is one of those rare people. He is a hero not a pirate. I appeal to the common sense and conscience of the Russian authorities to let my husband and the rest of the people from the Arctic Sunrise come home."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Following the seizure of his ship last month, Willcox refused a demand made under armed guard by Russian authorities to sail the Arctic Sunrise toward the Russian port city of Murmansk. Instead the ship was towed. In a 1993 Hollywood film about the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, the role of Pete Willcox was played by Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight - father of Angelina Jolie.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Speaking in court today Camila Speziale, 21, from Argentina said today:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; "I'm innocent and I do not understand what I'm accused of. I don't have anything against your country. Russia and Argentina have good relations. But now I'm arrested for something I haven't done. I really want to come back to my country and continue working and studying. I'm considered to be dangerous for society, but how it can be so? The whole world is demanding my release. Gracias."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Camila was wearing a t-shirt that her parents have sent her, on which are printed the hands and names of the Speziale family.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In a letter published on Sunday, Swiss activist Marco Weber said although he was being held alone in a cell, and had little or no contact with the outside world, apart from weekly visits by his lawyer and the Swiss consul, he had no regrets. "I faced danger and the risk ending up in jail, because I am sure that WE have the power to make a change!" &lt;em&gt;(Full letter in notes below)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In a letter to his family, Kieron Bryan, 29, a freelance film-maker from London, said he was well, apart from the "horrible uncertainty and anxiety". In the letter, also published Sunday, he said: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; "The food is basic or grim but I'll not starve… Lack of communication has been really tough - I just hope my lawyer can get messages to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council is expected to submit an appeal to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, Yuri Chaika, regarding the arrest of the 30. The head of the Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov stated last week that charges of piracy against the Greenpeace International crew, activists and two freelance journalists were groundless and unlawful. Now the other members of the Council have supported the initiative to appeal to the Prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Full letter from Marco Weber:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hello everyone! Out there ;-)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sorry my English is not very good, and my writing even worse! But I guess you will figure it out.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I am now for about 12 days alone in a cell. I don’t have books, newspaper, TV or someone to talk to. At the daily walk I am also isolated. The 4x5 metre “walkyard” is surrounded by concrete walls and covered with iron bars. On top is a roof, which doesn’t allow the sunshine in.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The only sky I can see is out of my cell window , which is placed in the northern wall of the building. This means no sun at all. Days are long! The highlights are weekly visits of my lawyer and consul. And yesterday I got the first bunch of email from the outside! Yehaa…&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The aggressive and unfair acting of the Russian government and Gazprom shows how important it is, that decisions about Arctic and its future are made by global public. And not by states and companies which are blinded by its resources and short term profits.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; At the 18 September I faced danger and the risk ending up in jail, because I am sure that WE have the power to make a change! WE the massive amount of people worldwide which are brave and concerned enough to fight for a future to coming generations. Because we see the dependency of our future existing to the acting now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s save the Arctic and with it also the chance of future for mankind. Your support and the knowledge that we have done the right thing keeps me above water. Thank you very much for your kind words, love and care you give to me.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are incredibly important!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Marco Weber&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; CAN BE USED, IF IT’S ANY USEFUL&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don’t be worried about me! (for now)&lt;/p&gt;

	In April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the wide-scale impacts that can be caused by a catastrophic deep sea well failure.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand has raised concerns about exploratory drilling operations for deep sea oil that are planned for the summer of 2013/2014 offshore off the west coast of the North Island in the Taranaki Basin, and the east coast of the South Island in the Canterbury Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This report provides an evaluation of the likely dispersal trajectory of a deep water oil spill at the two proposed exploration sites. Analysis uses industry standard numerical modelling techniques to conduct an oil-spill trajectory analysis and determine the extent of oil propagation, dispersion and beaching in the event of a deep water blowout.&lt;/p&gt;

	A computer oil spill modelling report released today shows a deep-sea blowout could have devastating impacts on New Zealand's coastal waters and significant economic consequences.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Industry standard modelling by Wellington based data scientists Dumpark using ten years of climate and weather data, shows the blowout effects of two planned deep-sea drilling locations off the West Coast of the North Island and the East Coast of the South Island. The deepest current production well in New Zealand is 125 meters. Texan oil driller Anadarko is scheduled to begin the first deep-sea drilling (at 1500 meters) this summer off Auckland’s West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We predicted the trajectory of a thousand oil spill scenarios at two sites in New Zealand using ten years of global archives of marine weather data. We are basically answering a “what if” question. What if a catastrophic blowout scenario occurred at these deep-sea drill sites?” - Laurent Lebreton, Dumpark Ocean Modeller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modelling for the north shows the likelihood of oil hitting Auckland’s iconic West Coast beaches and harbours. In the south, a spill off the coast of Otago could spread across the Chatham Rise - a vital commercial fishing ground and marine wildlife habitat - reaching all the way to the Chatham Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the North Island scenario, a deep-sea blowout will probably have dramatic consequences for the entire Western coastline and harbours from Taranaki’s Cape Egmont to Opononi in Northland - including Auckland’s West Coast beaches. For a blowout off Otago, most modelled trajectories drift eastward without encountering land for months between Christchurch and the Chatham islands.” - Timo Franz, Dumpark Data Analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spill modelling reports are a permitting requirement for oil drilling, however deep-sea oil spill modelling reports have not yet been made publicly available on the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel said “The Government have been understating the real risks being taken with our oceans and coastlines, so today we are showing New Zealanders what the Government, Minister Simon Bridges and industry already know and have kept hidden - the full extent of the risk of deep-sea drilling.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drilling at these depths is much riskier than the shallow drilling we currently have in New Zealand. This modelling suggests just how much of a threat deep-sea drilling could be to our values, our seas, our beaches, our way of life and our economic prosperity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill modelling report will be launched on Wednesday 23 October, alongside an interactive website and animation (&lt;a href="http://www.oilspillmap.org.nz/"&gt;www.oilspillmap.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, 11 October 2013 - Appeals for bail by lawyers for Phil Ball and Kieron Bryan, both British citizens, were today refused by the Regional Court of Murmansk.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Phil Ball is one of 28 Greenpeace International activists, along with New Zealanders David Haussmann and Jonathan Beauchamp, who were arrested by Russian special forces after a peaceful protest at an Arctic oil rig operated by Gazprom. Kieron Bryan is a freelance videographer who was contracted by Greenpeace International to document the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three activists and a Russian freelance photographer were refused bail earlier in the week. Further bail applications on behalf of the other activists will be heard next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Federation of Journalists and the European Federation of Journalists have today called for the immediate release of Kieron Bryan and Phil Ball (a registered journalist and activist) as well as the freelance Russian photographer Denis Sinyakov. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the Kremlin's Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, has also said the Greenpeace International activists cannot be charged with piracy as they did not have an intention to seize the oil rig. He has also said the council will appeal to the general prosecutor to change the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff ordered her top diplomat to probe Russia over the fate of Brazilian Greenpeace activist Ana Paula Maciel. President Dilma said the Foreign Ministry was determined to provide "any assistance" to Ana Paula Maciel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I asked Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo to make high-level contact with the Russian government to find a solution for Ana Paula," Rousseff wrote on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the latest developments in the case, Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those 30 brave men and women are in jail on trumped up charges, they are prisoners of conscience. They are there not because of what they did but because of what they represent. They are there not because of Russian law but because they made a stand against vested interests. Greenpeace does not think it is above the law, but those campaigners are not pirates, even President Putin says so, and every day they remain behind bars is an affront to the basic principles of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow (Saturday) Kumi Naidoo travels to Reykjavik, Iceland, to attend the opening of the Arctic Circle conference - a newly established forum where politicians, NGOs, corporations and other stakeholders meet to advance collaborative decision-making on Arctic issues. There he will urge other Arctic states to press for the release of the detainees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next confirmed bail hearing times are (all in local times):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday Oct 14 9:30 AM activist Camila Speziale (ARG) and crew member Cristian D'Alessandro (ITA); 10 AM Captain Peter Willcox (US); and 2 PM crew member David Haussmann (NZ). Tuesday Oct 15 10 AM activist Frank Hewetson (UK) and Marco Weber (SWISS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem with Genetic Engineering&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;How harmful is Genetic Engineering? Is relying on toxic chemicals the only way forward? Can 'business as usual' in agriculture provide food for the future? Greenpeace is working on all this and more.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agriculture is responsible for 14 percent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;a title="ecological farming" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/agriculture/solution-ecological-farming/"&gt;Ecological farming&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce these emissions, and help farmers cope with climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genetic Engineering makes us dependent on toxic chemicals and corporate control of agriculture. It poses unknown risks to our environment - and ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groundwater contamination, fewer places to fish and more pests resistant to pesticides: These are just some of the problems arising from industrial polluting agriculture's addiction to toxic chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological farming can produce 30 percent more food per hectare. Ecological farming gives people access to food where it is needed most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;Who's paying the price?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently nothing is being done to prevent the rapid expansion and industrialisation of the dairy industry. Under the newly legislated Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) the agricultural sector is exempt from taking real action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions until 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/image/2008/4/cowshed.jpg" title=""&gt;

            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Taupo, central North Island, New Zealand. Landcorp, a New Zealand Government owned company, currently converting Tahorakuri Forest into large-scale intensive dairy farms. Landcorp has embarked on a project to convert more than 25,000 hectares of pine plantations northeast of Taupo.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when it is brought into the &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/climate-change/emissions-trading-scheme/"&gt;ETS&lt;/a&gt;, the sector will be subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of 90 per cent of its emissions (due to the amount of free permit allocations given to it by the government). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Under the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand must buy credits to cover any increase in emissions over 1990 emission levels. A recent &lt;a href="http://www.sustainabilitynz.org/climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;Sustainability Council report&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) estimated the likely cost to the New Zealand taxpayer of covering agriculture's increased emissions would be around $1.3 billion. Under the current plans this will result in a direct subsidy to the sector. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without a price on agricultural emissions, there's no incentive to reduce them and invest in mitigation solutions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling for agriculture to be brought in under the ETS before 2013, and for a range of other measures to be put in place to encourage low-input, less intensive farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Arctic Sunrise&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Ironically, before Greenpeace chartered the Arctic Sunrise it was once a sealing vessel. Greenpeace also had previously confronted the ship while it was delivering equipment for the French government to build an airstrip through a penguin habitat in the Antarctic.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hull is rounded with no keel, so that the ship lifts out of the ice instead of being crushed by it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1996, Greenpeace had prepared the Arctic Sunrise for the icy conditions of Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object id="slideshow-tn430" width="430" height="330" data="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/flash/slideshows/ships-as/slideshow-tn430.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;param name="base" value="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/flash/slideshows/ships-as/"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://static.greenpeace.org/int/flash/slideshows/ships-as/slideshow-tn430.swf"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise began its Greenpeace life during the Brent Spar campaignwhere it was used to prevent dumping oil installations at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In1997 it became the first ship to circumnavigate James Ross Island in the Antarctic, which previously was an impossible journey until a 200mthick ice shelf connecting the island to the Antarctic continent collapsed. This was just one of the many signs of climate change whichthe Arctic Sunrise has helped document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise has returned repeatedly to the Arctic to oppose Northstar, British Petroleum's project to open up a new offshore oil frontier threatening oil spills in this vulnerable region and further contributing to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Southern Oceans it thwarted Japanese attempts to pursue its so-called "scientific" whaling programme and chased pirate vessels fishing illegally for Patagonian Toothfish to the largest pirate port of Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manoeuvring directly into the missile's pathdid not prevent the US from proceeding in 2000 to test its "Star Wars"missile defence system, which threatens to ignite a new nuclear arms race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the Arctic Sunrise survived to tell the tale and continued on to Argentina for the start of the Latin America toxics tour in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Captain of the Arctic Sunrise Arne Sorensen during the Southern Ocean expedition in December 1999&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are peacefully protesting against illegal Japanese whaling in the waters around Antarctica when we hear a mighty crash and the ship rolls heavily. The chief engineer David de Jong rushes to the bridge shouting"That didn't sound like ice"!&lt;br&gt;He's right - it's neither sea ice nor an iceberg, but the Japanese whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, 10 times the Arctic Sunrise's weight, ramming us.&lt;br&gt;Despite risking the lives of both crews, fortunately no one is hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Professor Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University after the Arctic Meltdown expedition in 2009&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The offer by Greenpeace to use the ship and her helicopter, and the assistance offered towards the cost of the ice mass balance buoys, demonstrate Greenpeace's commitment to supporting critical climate research in the vital area relating to changes in Arctic ice volumes and thickness - the theme that underlay all of the ship's work this summer. The support offered by the whole crew on board was amazing - unstinted, professional, and far better than I normally find on government-owned research ships."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is asking for urgent action on these species. We’re not asking New Zealanders to stop fishing or eating fish that are sustainably caught, but we are asking you not to buy the seafood listed in our Red Fish Guide unless you can be certain it’s truly sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fish species are on this list for one or more of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a life history that makes them very vulnerable to fishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are commonly sourced from overfished and depleted stocks, or are being fished at such a high rate that stocks are being depleted rapidly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fishing methods used to catch the fish are often highly destructive to other oceans creatures and/or habitats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace 'Red-Grade' Criteria for Unsustainable Fisheries provides more detail and background information for the assessment criteria used by Greenpeace scientists, and can be downloaded by clicking on the links on the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does this mean that everything not on this red list is sustainable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. There are many other types of fish and seafood that are from unsustainable fisheries.  The ones on the Greenpeace New Zealand seafood red list represent those that most require urgent action to ensure the future of these species and the fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thorough guide to the sustainability of New Zealand's main commercial fish species is available from the &lt;a title="Forest and bird: sustainability of NZ commercial fish species" href="http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/-best-fish-guide" target="_blank"&gt;Forest and Bird website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's every New Zealander's birthright to catch and eat fish. Let's preserve this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food and farming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;These things are fundamental to who we are, what we do and how New Zealand makes its way in the world. But there are big problems with the way we’re farming. The industrial farming model prevalent in New Zealand is damaging our land, water, climate and farmers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Zealand farming made a name for itself based on two simple five-letter words – clean and green - with our products setting us apart in shopping trolleys and baskets across the globe.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But somewhere along the way we lost our bearings.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Family farms got snapped up and subsumed into industrial-scale dairying operations. We began clear-felling forests to make way for industrial dairy farms, piling fertilizers onto the land; squeezing too many cows onto every hectare, and feeding them supplementary feed from destroyed Indonesian rainforests. All this to sell faceless milk powder on volatile global commodity markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This industrial, high input model has cost our rivers (two thirds are already at times too polluted to swim in safely) our water (New Zealand now has the highest rates of waterborne gastro disease in the developed world), our climate (agriculture emissions make up half New Zealand’s emissions and continue to rise) and our farmers. New Zealand dairy farmers are collectively burdened with &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/299110/banks-will-survive-dairy-downturn-rb" target="_blank"&gt;$38 billion worth of debt,&lt;/a&gt; putting unimaginable pressure on individuals, families and communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And things are set to get worse, with large-scale irrigation schemes planned across the country. People don’t necessarily make the link between irrigation and industrial farming. But the one leads directly to the other.  The reason big irrigation companies want to take water from our rivers is to enable more industrial agriculture (namely dairying) where it wouldn’t otherwise have occurred. Irrigation schemes are a golden ticket to more dairying and more water pollution.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The industrial dairying model is a failed experiment. Change is needed if New Zealand farming and farmers are to prosper again. We need to make New Zealand farming something we can be proud of again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impacts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;No one knows how much warming is "safe". What we do know is that climate change is already harming people and ecosystems. Its reality can be seen in melting glaciers, disintegrating polar ice, thawing permafrost, dying coral reefs, rising sea levels, changing ecosystems and fatal heat waves.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not only scientists that are witnessing these changes. From Inuit in the far north to islanders near the equator - people are already struggling with the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;Extreme weather&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Flooded village in southern France, close to a nuclear power station. Earlier in 2003 the same area experienced a long drought. Climate change means more extreme weather like flooding and droughts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of this is only the beginning. We are already experiencing dangerous climate change…we need to act to avoid catastrophic climate change. While not all regional effects are yet known, here are some likely future effects if we allow current trends to continue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relatively likely and early effects of small to moderate warming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sea level rise due to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of the oceans as global temperature increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massive releases of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost and dying forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high risk of more extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and floods. Already, the global incidence of drought has doubled over the past 30 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe impacts on a regional level. For example, in Europe, river flooding will increase over much of the continent, and in coastal areas the risk of flooding, erosion and wetland loss will increase substantially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural systems, including glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, arctic ecosystems, alpine ecosystems, boreal forests, tropical forests, prairie wetlands and native grasslands, will be severely threatened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in existing risks of species extinction and biodiversity loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest impacts will be on the poorer countries least able to protect themselves from rising sea levels, spread of disease and declines in agricultural production in the developing countries of Africa, Asia and the Pacific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At all scales of climate change, developing countries will suffer the most.&lt;/li&gt;

            Flames consume huge areas of forest in Montalvao, Portugal. Portugal declared a national disaster after the worst forest fires in more than two decades killed nine people, torched thousands of hectares of  forest and destroyed homes in 2003.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Longer term catastrophic effects if warming continues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet melting. Unless checked, warming from emissions may trigger the irreversible meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet in the coming decades, which would add up to seven meters of sea-level rise, over some centuries; there is new evidence that the rate of ice discharge from parts of the Antarctic mean that it is also at risk of meltdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlantic Gulf Stream current slowing, shifting or shutting down, having dramatic effects in Europe, and disrupting the global ocean circulation system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catastrophic releases of methane from the oceans leading to rapid increases in methane in the atmosphere and consequent warming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never before has humanity been forced to grapple with such an immense environmental crisis. If we do not take urgent and immediate action to stop global warming, the damage could become irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nuclear crisis in Fukushima Japan&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our first thoughts are with the people of the Japan&lt;/strong&gt;,as they face the threat of a nuclear disaster, following an already devastating earthquake and tsunami. Our heartfelt condolences go to all those affected by this tragic chain of events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We commend the heroism of the nuclear workers fighting to stabilize the situation, and seriously risking their health through exposure to radiation. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What this crisis again demonstrates is that nuclear power is a dirty and dangerous power source, and will always be vulnerable to the potentially deadly combination of human error, design failure and natural disaster. Greenpeace is calling for the phase out of existing reactors around the world, and no construction of new commercial nuclear reactors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Governments should instead invest in renewable energy resources that are not only environmentally sound but also affordable and reliable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We've created a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/nuclear/safety/accidents/Fukushima-nuclear-disaster/Fukushima-nuclear-crisis-briefing/"&gt;Fukushima briefing page&lt;/a&gt; to answer some of the most common questions we're hearing.

	Suva/Sydney, August 5, 2013 – A new report, launched today by Greenpeace Australia Pacific, provides a blueprint for how Pacific Island governments and regional bodies can promote a more sustainable and locally owned and operated tuna fishery in the region.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report - titled Transforming Tuna Fisheries in Pacific Island Countries: An Alternative Model of Development – makes detailed recommendations for how to develop smaller-scale and locally owned fisheries that will maximise economic returns, create local jobs and better protect countries’ precious tuna reserves for the long term.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oceans campaigner Duncan Williams says Greenpeace is advocating support for sustainable and equitable tuna fisheries to prevent a tuna crisis in the Pacific - the biggest tuna fishery in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In Australia and the UK all major tuna brands and retailers are now committed to buying only responsibly sourced tuna. Pacific Island countries can put themselves in the driver’s seat and reap the benefits of this shift.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lead author of the report, Dr Kate Barclay from Sydney’s University of Technology (UTS) says, “While the Western and Central Pacific Ocean supplies over 60 per cent of all tuna consumed globally, profits made out of this resource are not reaching the small island economies from where the tuna is sourced.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “A shift away from the large-scale industrial model of fishing, towards smaller-scale vessels operated in coastal island countries by communities and local entrepreneurs should result in greater economic benefits for Pacific countries, and place management of the resources more effectively within their control.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Most tuna fishing in the Pacific is done by foreign vessels which pay access fees to island countries, usually only 5-6 percent of the landed value of the fish.&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s Duncan Williams says, “This report shows how governments and regional organisations can encourage the development of small and medium scale fishing entities, particularly artisanal fisheries.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Emerging market opportunities for socially responsible and environmentally sustainable seafood offer a new route to develop domestic tuna fisheries in the Pacific,” said Mr Williams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report was compiled over a period of two years and is a collaborative effort between academic experts, tuna fisheries practitioners and Greenpeace. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Key recommendations focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better managing the tuna fishery – eg exclude large-scale and destructive foreign-owned vessels from national waters or parts thereof. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosting Pacific Islander involvement and investment – eg address unfavourable cost structures for domestic fisheries through taxation reform and introduce higher access costs for distant water vessels. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting artisanal fisheries – eg reserve inshore and archipelagic areas for sustainable artisanal fisheries only. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raising awareness of sustainable and responsible tuna fisheries to build and sustain market demand for pole and line, handline and artisanal tuna fisheries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	A star-studded array of New Zealanders has joined forces to criticise the government in a new campaign to be launched this (Wednesday) evening.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hollywood actor Sam Neill, award-winning musicians the Topp Twins, Tiki Taane and Warren Maxwell have teamed up with acclaimed writer Albert Wendt, academic Dr Ranginui Walker, leading businessman Phillip Mills, entrepreneur Nick Gerritsen, former Acting Judge of the Supreme Court Sir Ted Thomas and many others (full list below) to condemn the government’s plans for deep sea oil drilling and attempts to crack down on peaceful protests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uniting under the slogan &lt;a title="Get Free" href="http://www.getfree.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Get Free&lt;/a&gt;, they have created a new three-minute ‘call to action’ addressed to the nation, which can be seen, from 7.30pm this evening, at www.getfree.org.nz. In it, they call for New Zealanders to stand together in defence of the country’s oceans, the New Zealand way of life, the right to protest and against the government's plans to drill for deep sea oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backing clean energy instead would, say the group, be a boost for New Zealand’s environment and economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost 30,000 jobs could be created in areas such as the geothermal and bioenergy industries, revealed a report, released earlier this year and based on scientific modelling carried out by experts in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The analysis shows that the geothermal industry alone could be worth over NZ$4billion to the economy every year. And a growing bioenergy sector could see New Zealand becoming increasingly less reliant on foreign oil imports, saving the country over NZ$7billion each year by 2035 (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The call comes in the wake of the National-led government’s controversial crackdown on protest at sea and as New Zealand’s reputation for being clean and green faces increasing international scrutiny. In recent days, Texan oil company Anadarko has announced plans to drill in New Zealand waters in the coming months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, head of Greenpeace, who co-ordinated Get Free, said: “The Get Free message is loud and clear that if we don’t stand up now, we stand to lose things of great value to us - our democratic rights and our unpolluted waters.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Ted Thomas said: “The new law making it illegal to protest at sea is shameful. We have a long history of defending our land and sea and fighting for our freedoms. In many ways protest has provided the strong foundations on which we have built New Zealand. If there ever was a time to protect our country, now is that time.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leading New Zealand businessman and founder of the Pure Advantage group Phillip Mills said: “From a business perspective, failure to deal with climate change will undo all of our hard work. Conversely, the greatest future opportunities lie in dealing with this problem. The intelligent path for New Zealand is clean energy innovation, not the blind pursuit of more oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entrepreneur Nick Gerritsen said: “The evolution of the green economy is a natural fit for NZ. It's what we do. It's what the world thinks and expects of us. It's common sense because it’s where our competitive advantage rests.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Others participating in Get Free include Lady Blake and Peter Williams QC, oncologist Dr George Laking, Te Whanau ā Apanui kaumātua Rikirangi Gage and lawyer Dayle Takitimu, surfing stars Mischa Davis and Daniel Kereopa, actors Robyn Malcolm and Lucy Lawless and Maria Tyrrell, the daughter of RNZN Commander Alan Tyrrell who was the Commanding Officer of the HMNZS Otago at the Moruroa Protests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government’s new law banning aspects of peaceful protesting at sea was heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians when it was introduced. Over 45,000 people signed a statement against the new measures.&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington, 13 September 2013 – One hundred shark fins have appeared in a lagoon on the capital city's waterfront, close to Te Papa, on Black Friday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 8px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/oceans/2013/shark-finning/BT_ZUjMCcAI20YE.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"&gt;The floating, handmade fins are part of an art installation commissioned by Greenpeace for New Zealand’s first-ever shark awareness week. The week of activities is being promoted by the New Zealand Shark Alliance (1) which is calling for a ban on shark finning New Zealand waters. Shark finning is the practice of catching and killing a shark, slicing off its fins and dumping its body back in the sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas says most Kiwis are unaware that shark finning is legal in New Zealand and are often shocked when they find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For sharks swimming in New Zealand waters every day is Black Friday,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The grey fins in the lagoon represent the almost 100 countries and states, including Australia, USA and all the EU countries, to have banned shark finning. One floating orange fin represents New Zealand as the outsider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our government must join those other countries and ban shark finning in our waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand’s clean green brand is under threat while we allow shark finning to continue off our coasts while other countries ban finning or create shark sanctuaries.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Wednesday evening bright orange shark fins have been appearing in highly visible spots around the central city like errant road cones and are linked to the lagoon installation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They symbolize how bizarre it is that 100 per cent pure New Zealand allows the senseless and wasteful practice of shark finning to happen in its waters, says Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand is among the world's top 10 nations for killing and exporting sharks (1) and a major exporter of shark fins to Hong Kong. Recently we became the biggest exporter of dried shark fins to the United States.(2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every day around 27,000 sharks are killed globally, and the trade in shark fins is driving much of this slaughter (3). This is causing a serious decline in the world's shark populations, and many species are under threat. In New Zealand that includes porbeagle, shortfin mako and blue sharks which are the three main species to be finned. (4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government has announced it will soon review its policies around shark fishing and conservation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We need more people than ever before to show their support for a ban on shark finning in New Zealand. The sharks need as much backing as possible, so register you support on our website and we'll let you know what to do when the government asks for public feedback," says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos from today’s event in Wellington will be available shortly from here.&lt;/p&gt;

	Pechora Sea, September 20, 2013 — The Russian Coast Guard has boarded the Greenpeace International ship Arctic Sunrise and arrested the 25 activists on board, including two New Zealanders, following a protest against Gazprom’s Arctic oil drilling operations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The names of the arrested crew have not been released yet due to legal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the boarding, the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; was circling Gazprom’s &lt;em&gt;Prirazlomnaya&lt;/em&gt; platform at the three nautical mile limit, inside international waters. Coordinates confirm that the ship was inside of Russia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), making this an illegal boarding by the Russian Coast Guard. (1) The coordinates at the time of the boarding were: 69-19-53N : 57-16-53E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a helicopter and ropes, armed Coast Guard officials boarded the vessel and started rounding up the activists, assembling them on the helideck. Greenpeace International activists locked inside the radio room said they saw other activists detained on their knees with guns pointed at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard had earlier arrested and held without charge two Greenpeace International activists who had scaled Gazprom’s drill platform on Wednesday in a peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This illegal boarding of a peaceful protest ship highlights the extreme lengths that the Russian government will go to to keep Gazprom’s dangerous Arctic drilling away from public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We ask President Putin to restrain the Coast Guard and order them to holster their guns and withdraw. We are a peaceful organisation and our protest has done nothing to warrant this level of aggression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian Ministry of International Affairs earlier claimed the Coast Guard intervened during Wednesday’s protest because the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; represented an environmental and security threat — a claim that Greenpeace International strongly disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Coast Guard has boarded our vessels with guns, threatened our activists at gunpoint and fired 11 warning shots across our ship, so who is the real threat to safety here?” said Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace International’s Arctic oil campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drilling for oil here in the Arctic is a grave environmental risk that must be stopped and this is why Greenpeace International came here, taking peaceful action to defend the environment on behalf of the millions of people around the world who are opposed to drilling operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Make no mistake, the real threat to the Arctic comes not from Greenpeace International but from oil companies like Gazprom that are determined to ignore both science and good sense to drill in remote, frozen seas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	The crew of the Greenpeace icebreaker Arctic Sunrise, which includes two New Zealanders, remain in the custody of Russian authorities following an armed boarding of the ship in international waters yesterday. The ship has now been under armed guard since 1900 Moscow time on Thursday (3am Friday NZ time).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
Due to legal reasons the names of the two New Zealanders can still not be confirmed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is now almost 24 hours since Greenpeace International has had any contact with the ship, which appears to be under tow to Murmansk.

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Greenpeace International has not received any formal confirmation of possible charges, and the activists have been denied access to legal or consular assistance. Over 20 Greenpeace offices are organising protests at Russian embassies around the world today.  

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The head of Greenpeace International’s Arctic oil campaign, Ben Ayliffe, said:

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

“The safety of our activists remains our top priority and we are working hard to establish what is facing them. They have done nothing to warrant this level of aggression and have been entirely peaceful throughout. In our last phone call with the ship, the crew said that their spirit remains high and they have been boosted by messages of support from thousands of people who stand with them to oppose dangerous Arctic oil drilling.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 

“The real threat to the Russian Arctic comes not from the crew of the Arctic Sunrise but from Gazprom, one of the most reckless oil companies in the world today.”

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

According to one Russian media report (1), senior officials on Gazprom’s Prirazlomnaya oil platform described a Greenpeace safety pod used in the protest as ‘resembling a bomb’. In reality the safety pod - designed to keep the activists warm - measures 3 meters long by 2 meters wide, is brightly coloured, and heavily branded with Greenpeace logos (2).The safety pod was designed by competition winner Rubén Bodewig, an architecture student from Spain who beat 350 entrants.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 

According to activists on the ship, Russian FSB agents forced their way into the ship’s radio room and inflicted significant damage to communication equipment. Some activists were able to conduct interviews by satellite phone from the ship’s mess, where they are being held.

	Greenpeace campaigners have delivered a demand carved in ice, saying FREE ARCTIC 30, to the Russian Embassy in Wellington this morning. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They were joined by concerned Wellingtonians in calling for the release of 30 Greenpeace activists, including two New Zealanders, who have been held onboard the Arctic Sunrise ship since Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2013/DLgp130923-002s.jpg" alt='Greenpeace volunteers, along with concerned Wellingtonians, deliver a message sculpted in ice saying "FREE (the) ARCTIC 30" to the Russian  Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand. The peaceful protest is in response to the Russian Coast Guard holding 30 Greenpeace activists, including two New Zealanders, under armed guard and without legal representation after the *Arctic Sunrise* was boarded in Russian Arctic on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise is being towed by Russian authorities to the port of Murmansk, where they are expected to arrive at some point tomorrow (Tuesday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace International strongly rejected an allegation of piracy leveled at its ship Arctic Sunrise in the Russian Arctic, describing it as a desperate attempt to justify the illegal boarding of its ship in international waters.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace activists remain under armed guard and without legal representation after the ship was boarded on Thursday. Greenpeace is demanding that it is allowed to contact the activists immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 300,000 people have written to Russian embassies and consulates around the world since Thursday evening demanding the release of the activists. Greenpeace offices in over 30 countries have organised solidarity protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace’s campaign director, said: “We’re here today with a very simple message for the Russian authorities: Free the Arctic 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that delivering this message carved in ice will, along with similar activities at dozens of Russian embassies around the globe, make them take notice. The Russian coast guard boarded our ship with no legal justification. Now they should release her, and all the activists on board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Investigative Committee announced on Friday that it is formally considering charges of piracy (1), despite the fact that piracy by definition can only apply to violent acts against ships committed for private ends - not peaceful protests carried out to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal experts have joined Greenpeace International lawyers to declare the boarding of the ship in international waters as illegal. Professor Geert-Jan Knoops, an international criminal law expert based in the Netherlands, said on Friday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; "As far as the facts are known to me exactly, the Russian coast guard was not entitled [to board the ship]”. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship’s co-ordinates at the time of arrest were 69 19.86’N 057 16.56’E, showing that the vessel was clearly outside Russia’s territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, 24th September 2013: Russian authorities today released a new statement (1) regarding Greenpeace International activists, including two New Zealanders, on board the ship Arctic Sunrise. The Greenpeace ship is currently being held outside the port city of Murmansk. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The statement announces that the Northwestern Federal District Investigations Directorate has ‘opened a criminal case’ into possible piracy offences but - despite some media reports - does not confirm that the crew will be charged or prosecuted with piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo responded to the Russian statement: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Peaceful activism is crucial when governments around the world have failed to respond to dire scientific warnings about the consequences of climate change in the Arctic and elsewhere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Any charge of piracy against peaceful activists has no merit in international law. We will not be intimidated or silenced by these absurd accusations and demand the immediate release of our activists.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement posted online in response to the boarding of the Arctic Sunrise, International legal expert Assoc. Prof. Stefan Kirchner said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Labelling non-piracy acts as piracy can harm international anti-piracy efforts...

	Murmansk, September 24, 2013 - The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is close to arriving in the port of Murmansk after being boarded by Russian authorities last week following a peaceful protest against Arctic oil drilling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ship arrived under tow in the fjord near Murmansk around 10:00 local time this morning accompanied by a tug boat and the Russian Coast Guard vessel Ladoga, following Thursday’s boarding by armed security forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of independent legal experts have now supported Greenpeace International’s position that the boarding was illegal under international law. (1) Separately, over 50 Russian NGOs including WWF Russia have signed a joint statement calling for the activists to be released. (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International lawyers are demanding immediate access to the 30 activists, including two New Zealanders, who have been held for over four days without legal or consular assistance. It is still not known whether Russia intends to lay formal charges and Greenpeace has not received any formal contact from the authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace International has a 40 year history of taking peaceful action to protect the environment, and last week’s protest against dangerous Arctic oil drilling was carried out in line with these strong principles. Our activists did nothing to warrant the reaction we’ve seen from the Russian authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s been four days since our ship was boarded and we have still not been offered a legal basis for the raid, and nor have our activists been allowed any contact with lawyers or consular officials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our activists are motivated only by a passionate belief in the need to protect the Arctic from reckless oil drilling and climate change. We demand their immediate release.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In August last year Naidoo protested at the same Prirazlomnaya platform (3) as well as appearing alongside Russian scientists to present evidence showing the potential consequences of an oil spill from the structure. The study estimated that over 3,000 miles of Russia’s coastline could be affected (4).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International today highlighted worker footage of the platform showing a large safety ladder being ripped off the side of the platform during a fierce Arctic storm in October 2011 (5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A full timeline of events, as well as Greenpeace International’s response to various allegations about the direct action including possible piracy charges are available at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/arctic/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/arctic/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONTACT:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/Greenpeace-activists-scale-Gazprom-drilling-platform-two-arrested-in-Arctic-oil-protest/"&gt;Information about last week’s protest at Gazprom’s oil platform can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://photo.greenpeace.org/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox&amp;amp;STID=27MZIFV1XJTU&amp;amp;CT=Story"&gt;Link to primary news edit from Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; (and where other materials will also be uploaded as and when we receive any): &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any new film footage will also appear on ftp.greenpeacemedia.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Username: dvout / Password: 3e4r5t / Folder: 1309_Arctic_Sunrise_Murmansk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Prof. Dr. Stefan Kirchner, Visiting Professor Fundamental and Human Rights, University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, stated in a legal opinion published 22 September 2013:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Russia’s actions with regard to the ARCTIC SUNRISE are incompatible with the international law of the sea as codified in the Law of the Sea Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and possibly other international treaties. It appears that Russia has violated the human rights of the crew members as well as rights of the flag State (Netherlands) and of the crew members‘ respective home States. In order to comply with international law, Russia has to ensure the speedy release of the vessel and its crew.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prof. Dr. Gert Jan Knoops, Adjunct Professor International Criminal Law, stated in Dutch daily De Volkskrant on 20 September 2013 that, judging on the information available to him, the Russian Coast Guard lacked the legal authority to board the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prof. Dr. Doris König, Claussen Simon Chair for International Law at Bucerius Law School in Hamburg commented on 20 September 2013 that it is likely that the ship’s arrest outside of the safety zone constitutes a violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) NGOs included WWF Russia, Moscow and Bellona, St. Petersburg. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/ru/news/2013/23-09-together-Arctic-Sunrise/"&gt;Joint statement is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3)&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/Greenpeace-International-head-boards-Gazprom-Arctic-oil-platform/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Greenpeace-International-head-boards-Gazprom-Arctic-oil-platform/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4)&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/news/Prirazlomnaya-oil-spill-would-threaten-Russian-Arctic-with-irreparable-disaster-study-/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/news/Prirazlomnaya-oil-spill-would-threaten-Russian-Arctic-with-irreparable-disaster-study-/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) Ladder footage seen at &lt;a href="http://tv29.ru/?bl60number=8211"&gt;http://tv29.ru/?bl60number=8211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wwf.ru/data/mailer/media/spravka_po_gazpromu_clean.pdf"&gt;Cited by WWF Russia PP 8 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 30 January 2014 – L’Oreal, the world’s largest beauty and cosmetics company, has committed to remove forest destruction from its products by 2020. Greenpeace expects other companies to follow with more ambitious timelines.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“In a win for consumers around the world, L’Oreal has committed to ending its role in forest destruction. Thousands of people in Indonesia and around the world who have signed up demanding forest-friendly products will be turning their eyes to companies such as P&amp;amp;G, the producer of Heads &amp;amp; Shoulders, and Colgate Palmolive to guarantee that they too are not peddling dirty palm oil from forest destruction,” said Bustar Maitar, head of the Indonesia Forest Campaign at Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’Oreal now joins Nestle, Unilever and Ferrero, which have committed to No Deforestation policies. Other palm oil giants are starting to move too, with the largest palm oil trader in the world, Wilmar International, committing to a No Deforestation policy late last year due to public pressure from NGOs and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While L'Oreal' and Unilever's No Deforestation commitments send a strong signal to the sector, they still allow their suppliers six more years to clear forests. With global warming and rapid biodiversity loss, we urge these companies to guarantee consumers that their products will be free from forest destruction before their 2020 deadline,” said Bustar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committing to a policy is just the first step to guaranteeing consumers are not made part of forest destruction through the products they consume daily. Greenpeace will continue to push L’Oreal and other companies in Greenpeace’s Tiger Challenge to take their policies from words to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palm oil sector is the greatest single cause of deforestation in Indonesia. Ministry of Forestry maps show that Indonesia is losing some 620,000ha of rainforest every year (an area greater than the size of Brunei), and is pushing iconic species such as the as few as 400 Sumatran Tiger to the edge of extinction. Palm oil’s expansion into New Guinea and Africa is already threatening forests, sparking controversy and conflict with local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, 30 January 2014 - Speaking with investors today, Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden announced that the company would not attempt to drill in the Alaskan Arctic in 2014.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div class="text" style="outline-style: none; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;

&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e;"&gt;Responding to the news, Greenpeace International Arctic oil campaigner Charlie Kronick said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e;"&gt;"Shell’s decision to gamble on the Arctic was a mistake of epic proportions. The company has spent huge amounts of time and money on a project that has delivered nothing apart from bad publicity and a reputation for incompetence. The only wise decision at this point is for Mr. Van Beurden to cut his company's losses and scrap any future plans to drill in the remote Arctic ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e;"&gt;"Shell’s Arctic failure is being watched closely by other oil companies, who must now conclude that this region is too remote, too hostile and too iconic to be worth exploring. In an era of declining profits, increasing costs and unprecedented levels of public scrutiny the Arctic is simply not worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e;"&gt;"Millions of people around the world have helped to shine a light on Arctic drilling and this has started to affect Shell’s brand [1]. We will continue to increase this pressure as long as the company continues its stubborn pursuit of the fragile Arctic environment. This is one of the defining environmental issues of our time. We are drawing a line in the ice here to say to these oil companies ‘you come no further’.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e;"&gt;Since late December alone, over 150,000 people have written to Shell’s new CEO Ben Van Beurden asking him to scrap the company’s Arctic plans and recognise the unique technical challenges of operating in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 15 February 2014 – Mainlanders headed to the beach in droves today to demonstrate their opposition to deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand waters.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;‘Banners on the Beach’ activities attracted well over 2000 people to over 20 beaches from Golden Bay to Bluff. Estimates for the biggest crowds were Dunedin (600) Christchurch (500) and Kaikoura (350).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last year thousands also protested in dozens of locations on North Island beaches as Texan oil giant Anadarko was preparing to drill off the coast of Raglan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s event follows recent protests at sea by Otago, Kaikoura and Wellington community groups opposing deep sea oil as Anadarko starts exploratory drilling work off Otago and continues seismic surveying in the Pegasus Basin near Kaikoura and Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Residents of Kaikoura, known for its whale watch tourism, say they are defending their livelihoods from the acoustic booms that are known to distress whales and dolphins and from an oil spill that could devastate their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Otago community leaders, who last weekend sailed out and radioed opposition to the captain of the Anadarko drillship Noble Bob Douglas, say the urgent need for action on climate change means the reckless search for oil and gas must stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Steve Abel says today’s turnout has again sent a strong message to the government and oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Over 2000 people and families that have joined in today show that Kiwis don’t want deep sea drilling off our coasts. That’s not the future we want for New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We don’t want to see dozens of oil rigs dotted off our coastlines – that is the awful vision of John Key and Anadarko. We want jobs for New Zealanders that don’t ruin our fishing grounds or risk oil washing on our beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s about defending the way people put food on the table in New Zealand now and not selling out our kids’ future to foreign oil companies. We belong as part of the solution – sticking true to our clean green values and innovating a way forward – not as another oily backwater run for the benefit of US drillers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Banners on the Beach is organised by a coalition of local oil free groups and Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Responding to news today that the Government will not allow New Zealanders the chance to have a say about exploratory oil drilling, by classifying it as a ‘non-notified discretionary activity’, Steve Abel, Greenpeace’s energy campaigner, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a cowardly move from a Government doing the bidding of foreign oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This announcement is a slap in the face for anyone who wants their kids to swim in clean seas, for whom fishing is a way of life, and who believes in our right to have a say. It strips away the chance for New Zealanders to protest about the most dangerous stage of oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government are little more than lackeys for the oil industry. A government who wanted to see our economy boosted by billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs would turn their backs on this outdated industry and back our own, cutting-edge clean energy industry instead.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says the reported failure of Texan company Anadarko to find oil off both the Raglan and Otago coasts confirms the Government needs to stop supporting foreign oil companies and start backing our local clean energy industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“If its correct they have failed to find oil for a second time there are many who will open a Speights tonight in celebration of the news that Texan oil company Anadarko are about to batten the hatches and get out of here.” said Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“People in Dunedin, Kaikoura and Banks Peninsula will be breathing a sigh of relief that oil isn’t about to hit the beaches where their kids swim.  While Anadarko’s shareholders must be asking, “Why are you wasting hundreds of millions drilling dry wells in New Zealand?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government should give up its manic pursuit of deepsea oil drilling off our coasts. Backing such a dirty industry is at odds with everything we stand for as a country - meanwhile the clean energy sector is booming globally. This is where New Zealand belongs - backing clean energy,” said Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New Zealand government is subsidising the oil and gas industry by $46 million dollars annually. (1) The National-led government has significantly increased its support for oil and gas through indirect subsidies such as taxbreaks and support for exploration data and research - up from $6 million in 2009 to $46 million in 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Policy Advisor Nathan Argent said “Deepsea oil drilling is a risk to both our environment and economy. 50% of jobs in New Zealand rely on our clean green reputation and 70% of exports rely on New Zealand’s clean green reputation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government needs to get behind our clean energy experts, especially in the areas of R&amp;amp;D and public funding. We need to create the right framework so that businesses in New Zealand know the government is serious about creating jobs, rebuilding our economy and reducing pollution.  And the only way they can do that is by choosing a clean energy path.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s time for New Zealanders to get excited about our future. But we need to hurry up and get on board the clean tech train before we're left behind at fossil fuel station.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;END&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://awsassets.wwfnz.panda.org/downloads/wwf_fossil_fuel_finance_nz_subsidies_report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://awsassets.wwfnz.panda.org/downloads/wwf_fossil_fuel_finance_nz_subsidies_report.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 1 April 2014 – In response to the International Court of Justice ruling today that the Japanese whaling programme is not scientific [1] Karli Thomas, Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner said:


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is a great day for whales and everyone who has campaigned against whaling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We welcome this outcome which vindicates our view that whaling in the South Ocean is not necessary for science and should be ended. We urge Japan to abide by this decision, scrap the factory ship Nisshin Maru and not attempt to continue whaling by amending the program and claiming it is now scientific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We call on Japan to join international programs underway in the Antarctic to study whales and the environment in order to contribute to recovery from whaling and other threats and to give its support in other international treaties to create a network of ocean sanctuaries in the Southern Ocean, protecting all components of the ecosystem, starting with the Ross Sea and other areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace will continue to monitor Japan’s so-called scientific whaling to ensure that they do not find any more loopholes to hunt whales."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] Official ICJ ruling: http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/18162.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

	Energy and resources minister Simon Bridges should be sacked, Greenpeace said this afternoon.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The call comes after it was recently revealed that Bridges, who also holds the associate climate change portfolio, was unaware that he  had allowed swathes of Department of Conservation land to be opened up to the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Bridges announced that another 40 million hectares of sea and one million hectares of land would be available for the oil and gas industry. Part of this included a 200,000 hectare DoC park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Simon Bridges has got to be sacked. He’s utterly, eye-wateringly incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s handed over millions of hectares of New Zealand, including pristine forest, to the oil and gas industry. He either knew that this included hundreds of thousands of hectares of DOC land, or he didn’t know. Either way, that is incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In his rush to do the bidding of the oil industry, he’s ignoring our own, cutting-edge clean energy industry, which adds yet another layer of incompetency. The clean energy sector could provide tens of thousands of jobs, and give our economy a multi-billion dollar boost. The oil industry cannot come close to matching these figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only benefit to Bridges staying as energy minister is that he is an increasing liability for the very oil industry that he desperately wants to please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Prime Minister won’t sack him, then it’s all too clear that this government favours incompetency and the oil industry over innovation, prosperity and own clean energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the sake of our country, our future prosperity, our seas and our forests, just go, Simon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the government made exploratory oil and gas drilling a ‘non-notified discretionary activity’, which means that the public will not be consulted before oil companies start drilling. Last year, Bridges was criticised for introducing new offences which criminalised aspects of peaceful protests at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand Programme Director Carmen Gravatt comments on the findings in the report ‘Drilling for oil and gas in New Zealand’ released by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Jan Wright today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The report is yet another indictment of the government’s cowboy approach when it comes to protecting our precious land and water as it pursues its agenda to frack, drill and mine at any cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The government’s short-term pursuit of dirty fossil fuels has blinded them to the massive potential of clean technology to create thousands of jobs for New Zealanders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s clear that regulations around fracking are totally inadequate. There must be an immediate ban on this industry in New Zealand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Give your opinion political power.  You can write, email, call and even meet with your local and national political representatives to voice your concerns and your vision for a better future.  You can also write submissions ...

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Being part of a democracy is about much more than casting your vote every three years! You can shape the policies of political parties and the direction of the country by playing an active role in the political system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Member of Parliament (MP) is obligated to represent the concerns of your electorate in parliament so when you let your MP know what you think, they should represent this in the halls of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an hour then meet with your political representative, if you’ve got half an hour write to them and if you’ve only got 10 minutes then give them a call. Whichever way you do it, make the time to Get Political!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting with politicians in person demonstrates that you feel strongly about an issue and allows you to have a more in-depth conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often a minister's office will log calls about an issue so they can get a sense of community concern. By phoning them, you are registering your concern. And it only take 10 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace today launched a major new global campaign targeting the world’s biggest toy company [1], LEGO. They’ll be mobilising more than 5 million online Arctic supporters and thousands of activists to take creative action in six continents as part of the campaign [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/legoshellreport" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; [3], released today, Greenpeace accuse LEGO of putting sales above its commitment to the environment and children’s futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It called for LEGO to stop making toys with oil giant Shell’s branding on, because Shell is threatening the Arctic and the unique wildlife that depend on it. It warned Shell is using LEGO to neutralise controversy over its climate impacts and highly dangerous plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2012, Shell’s Arctic programme has faced fierce criticism from environmental NGOs and regulators. In that same period 16 million [4] Shell-branded LEGO sets were sold or given away at petrol stations in 26 countries [5], making Shell a major contributor to LEGO’s global sales [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell’s PR company valued the most recent two-year deal at $116 million, and reported that Shell achieved a 7.5% worldwide sales uplift during the promotion [7]. LEGO has confirmed to Greenpeace that a further co-promotion between Shell and LEGO has been agreed to start this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, New Zealand time, the campaign kicked off with a surge of pocket-sized protests in the UK. Staff at LEGOLAND in London, England, were baffled as outbreaks of LEGO Minifigure protests spread throughout the popular theme park. From the UK’s Big Ben to the Eiffel Tower in France to a World Cup football stadium in Brazil - no part of miniland was spared. The mini-protesters hung mini-banners saying ‘Save the Arctic’ and ‘block Shell’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Duff, Arctic Campaigner at Greenpeace, said: &lt;em&gt;“Children love the Arctic and its unique wildlife like polar bears, narwhals and walruses that are completely dependent on the Arctic sea ice. It’s a fragile environment and an oil spill would be devastating. And of course the only reason Shell can even reach the oil is because global warming is melting the ice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Climate change is an enormous threat facing all children around the world, but Shell is trying to hijack the magic of LEGO to hide its role. It is using LEGO to clean up its image and divert attention from its dangerous plans to raid the pristine Arctic for oil. And it’s exploiting kids’ love of their toys to build life-long loyalty it doesn’t deserve. It’s time for LEGO to finally pull the plug on this deal. We’re calling on LEGO to stand up for Arctic protection, and for children, by ditching Shell for good.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new campaign, Susan Linn, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Children form strong emotional attachments in childhood that last a lifetime, and companies know that all too well. Adverts aimed at children are bad enough, but branding their favourite playthings gain companies like Shell many hours and even days of their dedicated time, energy and love. We need to protect children’s imaginative play from branding for many reasons, including the important need for them to explore their own ideas and develop their own world view.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Campaigning organisations can register as charities, the Supreme Court ruled this afternoon.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes after a long-running court battle waged by Greenpeace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, the Supreme Court overruled the Court of Appeal, saying that that charities can engage in political activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace’s executive director, said: “This decision makes New Zealand democracy a little stronger. It means that the Supreme Court has now recognised that trying to change our world for the better, and taking on government to do that, is a public good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This has been a legal marathon, and it’s great to see that New Zealand democracy took out the gold.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2008:&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace New Zealand apply to the Charities Commission to be registered as a charity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; The Charities Commission declines Greenpeace’s application. The Commission said that, although the bulk of Greenpeace’s purposes and activities, such as the promotion of the protection and preservation of nature and the environment, were charitable, the promotion of disarmament and peace would not be charitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace appeal to the High Court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; The High Court finds that Greenpeace should not be able to register as a charity because the organisation’s nuclear disarmament purposes were independent political purposes and therefore non-charitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace head to the Court of Appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; The Court of Appeal agrees with Greenpeace, and says that the organisation’s peace and disarmament purposes were broadly charitable and the Charities Commission (now called the Charities Services) should consider the application again. The Court agreed that political advocacy did not disqualify an organisation from being a charity, as long as it was not a ‘primary purpose’. The Court also said that any activities carried out by a charity that were illegal would preclude that organisation from being a charity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 May 2013:&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace heads to the Supreme Court to challenge two of the Court of Appeal’s findings, arguing that restrictions should not be put on political advocacy, as it is not consistent with New Zealand’s participatory democracy for there to be a general prohibition on participation. The organisation also questioned whether the Court was able to judge where public benefit lies around political advocacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 August 2014:&lt;/strong&gt; The Supreme Court hands down its decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Orange roughy fisheries are a testament to unsustainable fishing. The species is long-lived, slow growing and late maturing, making it extremely vulnerable to overfishing. In New Zealand, where most of the catches are now taken, the orange roughy fishery has been managed under the quota management system since the early 1980s, but under that system the stocks have been decimated.

	Tickets to tomorrow night’s first-ever Climate Voter election debate have sold out but an online audience will also get to see the event live.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Over 55,000 New Zealanders have signed on at &lt;a href="http://www.climatevoter.org.nz/"&gt;www.climatevoter.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; as Climate Voters since the initiative was launched on June 22.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘The Great Climate Voter Debate’ will give representatives of six political parties a chance to convince a live audience plus online viewers to vote for them based on the action they are taking on climate change. The 330 tickets to the event at Auckland’s Q Theatre sold out last week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hosted by Samantha Hayes from TV3's 3rd Degree the line-up includes National’s Tim Groser, Minister for Climate Issues, Labour deputy leader David Parker, Green co-leader Russel Norman, New Zealand First deputy leader Tracey Martin and Internet Mana candidate John Minto. A spokesperson for the Maori Party has yet to be confirmed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two-hour event will be streamed via &lt;a href="http://www.climatevoter.org.nz/debate"&gt;www.climatevoter.org.nz/debate&lt;/a&gt; starting at 7pm. It will finish with a review by a panel of guest commentators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Community hosted screenings of the livestream have been organised in 13 centres from Whangarei to Dunedin. Locations are mapped here &lt;a href="http://bitly.com/cvscreenings"&gt;http://bitly.com/cvscreenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The debate has been organised by the Climate Voter initiative which is a non-partisan alliance of six leading New Zealand organisations: Forest and Bird, 350 Aotearoa, Greenpeace, Generation Zero, Oxfam New Zealand and WWF New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Organisers of an online campaign aimed at raising the profile of climate change as an election issue, say they have been vindicated by the High Court on crucial points of law.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning the High Court released its decision on the Climate Voter website at &lt;a href="http://www.climatevoter.org.nz/?cvs=greenpeace"&gt;http://climatevoter.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;  which the Electoral Commission considered to be an ‘election advertisement’ and therefore subject to a range of legal requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawyer for the Climate Voter initiative, Dr Matthew Palmer QC, says the Court’s judgment accepts the core legal arguments made by the Climate Voter groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The ruling confirms the core legal argument that the Electoral Act was not intended to capture normal issues-based advocacy. It upholds the right for websites to promote an issue as long as they do not encourage people to vote for or against a party or type of party,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Climate Voter groups say they believed that there was a very real risk that, if this law went untested, it could have had significant and insidious implications for freedom of speech in New Zealand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That’s why we challenged it and we’re very pleased the Court has recognised the important role that advocacy groups play in our democracy and agrees that the Electoral Act was not intended to capture non-partisan civil society groups who engage only in issues-based advocacy,” they say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the court accepted the core legal arguments of the Climate Voter groups, it pointed to two particular aspects of the website that meant it could not make the declarations sought. The Climate Voter groups will examine these further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 58,000 people have added their support since Climate Voter was launched on July 22 by Forest and Bird, 350 Aotearoa, Greenpeace, Generation Zero, Oxfam New Zealand and WWF New Zealand. Last week more than 13,000 people tuned in during the live stream of The Great Climate Voter Debate. The two-hour event at Auckland’s Q Theatre gave six of the main parties a chance to convince the live audience and online viewers that they are taking real action on climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The High Court also ruled that a parody website at &lt;a href="http://simon-bridges.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;http://simon-bridges.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; created by Greenpeace, which the Electoral Commission said was an election advertisement, leading to the site being taken down, could not be considered an election advertisement. The site, which appeared to belong to the Minister for Energy Simon Bridges, was engulfed by swirling oil as part of an ongoing campaign by the organisation against deep sea oil drilling.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace is very pleased that our position on the Bridges parody site is completely vindicated,” says spokesperson Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Following a Greenpeace campaign, LEGO published a statement [1] this morning committing to ‘not renew the co-promotion contract with Shell’. This decision comes a month after Shell submitted plans to the US administration showing it’s once again gearing up to drill in the melting Arctic next year [2].
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;During Greenpeace’s three month campaign, more than one million people signed a &lt;a href="http://www.legoblockshell.org/" target="_blank"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on LEGO to stop promoting Shell’s brand because of its plans to drill for oil in the pristine Arctic. In stark contrast to Shell, LEGO’s policies include a commitment to produce more renewable energy than they use, phase out oil in their products and, in cooperation with its partners, leave a better world for future generations [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its statement, LEGO argued the dispute was between Greenpeace and Shell. However, Greenpeace insists that while LEGO is doing the right thing under public pressure, it should choose its partners more carefully when it comes to the threats facing our children from climate change. Due to contractual obligations, LEGO’s &lt;a href="http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/fuels/ferrari-model-lego-collection.html" target="_blank"&gt;current co-promotion&lt;/a&gt; with Shell will be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Duff, Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “This is a major blow to Shell. It desperately needs partners like LEGO to help give it respectability and repair the major brand damage it suffered after its last Arctic misadventure. Lego’s withdrawal from a 50 year relationship with Shell clearly shows that strategy will not work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tide is turning for these fossil fuel dinosaurs that see the melting Arctic as ripe for exploitation rather than protection. The message should be clear; your outdated, climate wrecking practices are no longer socially acceptable, and you need to keep away from the Arctic or face being ostracised by society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEGO is the latest in a line of leading global companies to walk away from a relationship with the fossil fuel industry. In late 2012 Waitrose announced it has put its partnership with Shell on ice [4] and in the last month Microsoft, Google and Facebook all made commitments to end their support for ALEC, a controversial lobby group that campaigns against climate change legislation [5]. Only weeks ago, the Rockefeller Foundation announced it will begin pulling its investments in the fossil fuel industry [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian continued: “LEGO’s decision couldn't have come soon enough. The iconic and beautiful Arctic, and its incredible wildlife, like polar bears and narwhals, is under threat like never before. Arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, but instead of seeing the huge risks, oil companies like Shell are circling like vultures. Only weeks ago Shell gave us the clearest indication yet that it’s planning to go back to the Arctic as soon as next summer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell’s past attempts to drill in the Arctic have been plagued with multiple operational failings culminating in the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/04/shell-oil-safety-warnings-moved-drill-ship-us-coast-guard" target="_blank"&gt;running aground of its drilling rig, the Kulluk&lt;/a&gt;. The extreme Arctic conditions, including giant floating ice-bergs and stormy seas, make offshore drilling extremely risky. And scientists say that in the Arctic, an oil spill would be impossible to clean up meaning devastation for the Arctic’s unique wildlife [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on 28 August 2014 Shell submitted new plans to the US administration for offshore exploratory drilling in the Alaskan Arctic [8], meaning it’s on course to resurrect its Arctic drilling plans as early as summer 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, a massive global movement has emerged calling for a sanctuary around the North Pole, to protect the Arctic and its unique wildlife from the onslaught of oil drilling and industrial fishing. More than &lt;a href="http://www.savethearctic.org/" target="_blank"&gt;six million people&lt;/a&gt; have joined the movement, and more than 1,000 influential people have signed an &lt;a href="http://arcticdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Declaration&lt;/a&gt;, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Emma Thompson and Sir Paul McCartney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19 September UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, met with Arctic campaigners to receive a global petition and said he would consider convening an international summit to discuss the issue of Arctic protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the campaign, Greenpeace released a video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbliUq0_r4" target="_blank"&gt;LEGO: Everything is NOT awesome&lt;/a&gt; which reached nearly six million views. The video was temporarily taken down from YouTube because of a copyright complaint which was later withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

	Busan, South Korea, 7 Oct 2014 – Protesting the arrival of the Korean flagged fishing vessel Insung 3 in Busan today, Greenpeace accused the Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) of failing to regulate the illegal activity of its distant water fleet. Greenpeace activists painted “illegal” on the side of the Antarctic fishing vessel to highlight its involvement in illegal fishing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reportedly carrying 60 tonnes of illegal catch, Insung 3 returned to her home port in Busan to be investigated by the Minstry of Fisheries, following calls from Greenpeace after demanding the blacklisting of the illegal vessel Insung 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Korean Longliner Insung No3 arrives in Busan, South Korea.

The company’s fleet has had a history of illegal fishing in the Southern ocean since 2009, and triggered international debate on the failure of Korea to control their own fleet. The US identified Korea as an illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) nation in Jan 2013, followed by an EU pre-identification as IUU in Nov 2013. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insung not only ignores international law, but when the Korean MOF recently refused to issue a catch certificate for illegal catch, Insung refused to go to port for inspection and instead instructed one of its IUU vessels to stay at sea for 9 months, risking crew’s lives. Inspite of the company’s record, the Insung 3 reportedly faces punishment of a mere 30 day fishing ban and a pathetic $US 1,500 fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The naughty kid is back home and the world is watching to see if Korea has the determination or capability to control its own fleet. These IUU cases expose loopholes in existing legislation where the government does not have the legal ground to take further action.” said Jeonghee Han, Oceans Campaigner of Greenpeace East Asia. “Insung has repeatedly damaged Korea’s international reputation with IUU fishing, and are likely to be allowed to continue their business illegally exploiting the oceans. Insung IUU cases highlight alarming problems with existing legislation” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace exposed 34 cases of IUU, non-compliance and human rights abuse history by Korean vessels last year, and cases continue to emerge from both Africa and the Southern Ocean. Greenpeace is alarmed by continued IUU activities by Korean vessels. The Insung 7 and 3 show a flagrant disregard for international fisheries agreements. The only way to stop illegal fishing is through strengthened policy and implementation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the Korean government currently revising their Distant Water Fishery Development Act, Greenpeace urges the MOF to release the revision bill to civil society, for input by other stakeholders. Instead, the revision process has been delayed. “As an increasing number of illegal cases are discovered, a longer delay will result in a bigger loss to the Korean economy and damage to its reputation. If Korean IUU fishing is not urgently addressed, the EU and US may be pushed to give Korea a red card by end of the year.” said Jeonghee Han. A red card would mean Korea can neither sell fish to those countries, nor fish in their waters.&lt;/p&gt;

	An online platform that allows Kiwis to take the government, businesses and other decision makers to task has just been launched.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="TOKO petitions" href="http://www.toko.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;TOKO.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; is Aotearoa’s first ever people-powered petition platform. It gives New Zealanders the opportunity to participate in flax-roots community action using innovative technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched today, the platform has already attracted two petitions - one campaigning against &lt;a title="TOKO petition" href="http://www.toko.org.nz/petitions/don-t-send-our-troops-to-iraq" target="_blank"&gt;sending troops to Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and the other to &lt;a title="TOKO petition" href="http://www.toko.org.nz/petitions/stop-fracking-now-4" target="_blank"&gt;stop fracking in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; TOKO is hosted and funded by Greenpeace, although the non-profit organisation does not run or endorse any of the campaigns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace NZ Engagement Coordinator Genevieve Toop says the organisation is hosting TOKO because it wants to provide Kiwis with the tools and support they need to take meaningful action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Kiwi’s have a long-standing history of standing up for change and now they have innovative technology at their fingertips to help them do this.” she says &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Petitions can be started about anything as long as the issue is just, fair and sustainable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Toop says participants will also have regular contact with a TOKO team member who can offer advice and support to improve the campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Every Kiwi has the power to win campaigns and to create positive change and we’re there to help if needed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ”Petitions can be the catalyst for conversations that change how people think, and there are some interesting and creative ways you can use them to create maximum impact.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Māori, the word Toko means to have feelings and emotions spring up in your mind, to grow and to start moving. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It also forms part of the word 'Tautoko' which means to agree, support, or advocate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more info:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sophie Schroder, Greenpeace NZ Media &amp;amp; Communications, 021 086 47450&lt;br&gt; Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace NZ Engagement Coordinator, 021 316 840&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland politicians are facing increasing pressure over a controversial deep sea oil drilling vote set to take place in the Town Hall tomorrow.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Councillors are due to decide on Thursday morning whether or not Auckland will back plans to drill for oil off Auckland’s west coast, home to beaches such as Piha and Muriwai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Monday, around &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/auckland-nzpam-deep-sea-oil-submission/"&gt;10,000 Greenpeace supporters have contacted all 20 Auckland councillors and the Mayor&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to oppose the plans. In total over 200,000 emails on the subject have been sent to Auckland Council since the start of this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week Christchurch City Council &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/65535454/christchurch-city-council-opposes-deepsea-oil-drilling" target="_blank"&gt;came out against deepsea oil drilling plans off Canterbury.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.oilspillmap.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;computed oil spill model&lt;/a&gt;, using industry standard data, has shown that a deepsea blowout off Auckland’s west coast could see oil washing up on some of the region’s favourite beaches and harbours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace are hoping that around &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/347020392158280/" target="_blank"&gt;100 people will be outside the Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; as the councillors arrive tomorrow morning for the vote, which takes place during the first council meeting to be broadcast live online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel said: “We Aucklanders love our beaches and we love swimming in our seas. We’re sure that our councillors are no different, and that’s why we’re pretty confident that they’ll do the right thing tomorrow morning and oppose these oil plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A blowout off our coast could wreck the seas we fish in, and the beaches our kids play on. And it could have a devastating effect on our economy too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Christchurch Council has shown that they’re willing to take a stand to protect their economy and their beaches. Let’s hope Auckland councillors can do the same.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Auckland Council is due to submit the decision to the relevant government agency, New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals (NZPAM) on Monday. NZPAM is currently asking all local authorities and iwi for their views on oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Dozens of Greenpeace activists will be poised outside entrances to a major petroleum conference this morning holding mural-sized photographs that depict the human and animal suffering of climate-related crises.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right;" title="Oil bigwigs to be confronted by human suffering" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2014/_47Q2744_800dpi.jpg" alt="Oil bigwigs to be confronted by human suffering" width="620" height="416"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil executives arriving at Skycity Auckland Convention Centre to attend the Advantage New Zealand Petroleum Summit will have no choice but to walk through a montage of images showing destruction caused by the oil industry and climate change such as drought, floods, pollution and oil spills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s universally accepted that up to 80% of the fossil fuels we have on the books today can never be burnt if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy spokesperson Steve Abel says the aim of today’s protest is to show the 400 or so delegates at the summit that they and their industry must assume some responsibility for the terrible impacts of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The reality is the delegates and politicians inside the convention centre are helping sustain an industry that is globally recognised for causing irreparable damage to the earth and human lives,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These oil industry executives are people.  We are presenting them with the human face of terrible suffering - the cost of their industry - in a way that they can’t ignore. Our message is that they could apply their skills to clean energy instead.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The subject of deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand has been a controversial one. Yesterday, crowds of people marched from Victoria Park to Skycity to demonstrate their opposition to the  government’s oil agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groups such as Greenpeace New Zealand, 350 Aotearoa, Kiwis Against Seabed Mining and Oil Free Auckland banded together to organise the march. &lt;br&gt;At the Advantage New Zealand Petroleum Summit this morning, energy and resources minister Simon Bridges is expected to announce the government’s 2015 block offers for petroleum exploration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This would see more areas of New Zealand’s ocean being opened up to mostly foreign oil drillers to search for petroleum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The offers are likely to include hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of our ocean territory off the West Coast of the North Island, stretching from Taranaki to beyond Northland; as well as large offshore tracts of the East Coast of the North and South Islands, from Hawke’s Bay to  south of Bluff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says even the initial process of searching for oil is a risky business.&lt;br&gt;It involves exploration ships emitting continuous seismic blasts from underwater airguns every few seconds, day and night. The blasts are so powerful they can be heard from over 100 km away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even though the blasting is known to distress marine mammals, it’s being carried out right now over huge tracts of ocean and very close to the habitat of the critically endangered Maui’s Dolphin,” Abel says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There are only 55 of the subspecies remaining – I mean this is the world’s rarest dolphin - if the Government had its priorities right this wouldn't be happening at all.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep sea drilling also risks a catastrophic oil spill that could irreparably damage our oceans, coasts, economy and way of life, he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry standard oil spill modelling shows that a deep sea oil blowout could devastate New Zealand’s coastlines, with Auckland’s West Coast beaches such as Piha and Muriwai potentially being some of the worst affected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niamh O’Flynn, The national coordinator of 350 Aotearoa, says we must listen to the warnings of leading scientists before the damage is irreversible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They’re saying we must urgently move away from burning oil and towards clean energy if we want to reduce the extreme droughts, storms and food shortages that climate change is bringing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends &lt;/p&gt;

	There has been a surge in the number of people calling for Energy Minister Simon Bridges to be sacked following his shock move to allow oil and gas drilling in a marine sanctuary which is home to the critically endangered Maui’s dolphin.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The number of individual Kiwis who have signed Greenpeace’s “&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/sack-simon-bridges/"&gt;Sack Simon” petition&lt;/a&gt; has climbed to over 23,000 people this week. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More people have now called for Bridges’ sacking than voted for him (21,971 in the safe National seat of Tauranga.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This attack on the last 55 remaining Maui’s dolphin follows previous moves by Bridges to act on behalf of the fossil fuel industry at all costs,” says Greenpeace spokesperson Michael Tritt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April New Zealand's largest forest park was offered up for possible drilling and mining. Then a few days later Simon Bridges admitted that he didn't even know it existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“His reckless agenda is increasingly out of step with New Zealanders’ desire to protect their land, water and native species, and to act on climate change. John Key must sack him now.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government’s cosy relationship with multinational oil companies has blinded them to the economic opportunities of clean energy and technology and now they’re sacrificing our native dolphin to help prop up the fossil fuels industry.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/sack-simon-bridges/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/sack-simon-bridges/&lt;/a&gt; The online figure of 33,000 has been adjusted down after the removal of duplicates and non-NZers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 22 June 2014 – A campaign to mobilise thousands of Kiwis to use their vote in September’s election to support action on climate change was launched in Auckland this afternoon.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Citizens concerned about climate change are being asked to sign on at &lt;a href="http://www.climatevoter.org.nz/"&gt;climatevoter.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; to make their vote count “in the biggest challenge of our time.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign is being run by a non-partisan alliance of six of New Zealand’s biggest not-for-profit organisations - Greenpeace, Oxfam, Generation Zero, 350 Aotearoa, Forest &amp;amp; Bird and WWF.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel Brown CEO of the Sustainable Business Network was one of the first people to sign on at today’s launch event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’m a Climate Voter because I want the next government to seize the opportunity to make New Zealand a leader in clean energy innovation,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr George Laking was another early signatory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Politicians of all stripes must stop using climate change as a political football. It belongs as a core issue alongside other concerns like health and education, and must be taken seriously,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also commented on the wider human impacts of climate change; “Our Pacific neighbours for example need us to use our votes to help stop runaway global warming from destroying their islands”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortland St actor Cameron Jones added his support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’m a Climate Voter because I want real action on climate change and I’m prepared to use my vote to get it,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was announced at today’s launch that the six highest polling political parties will be invited to take part in a debate in Auckland on 3 September.  It will give the parties a chance to convince an audience of Climate Voters to vote for them based on the action they are taking on climate change. It will also be streamed live on &lt;a href="http://www.climatevoter.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;climatevoter.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more info:&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, Greenpeace Climate and Energy Campaigner, 021 927 301&lt;br&gt;Susi Newborn, Oxfam Campaigns Coordinator, 027 323 4035&lt;br&gt;Paul Young, Generation Zero, 027 418 8841&lt;br&gt;Ashlee Gross, 350 Aotearoa, 027 262 6121&lt;br&gt;Kevin Hackwell, Forest &amp;amp; Bird Advocacy Manager, 021 227 8420&lt;br&gt;Peter Hardstaff, WWF Head of Campaigns, 021 246 5665&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed something in your community that you think needs changing, solving, or stopping?  Have you got a great idea that you think would create a more fair, just and sustainable society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toko.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;TOKO.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; is Aotearoa’s first ever people powered petition platform. It’s for you to use to make the change you want to see in the world. TOKO enables you to launch, run and deliver your own campaign petition on just about anything, with all the technology you need at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOKO is people power: It’s participation, and it's flax-roots community action. In Māori, Toko means to have feelings and emotions spring up in your mind, to grow and to start moving. TOKO also forms part of the word "Tautoko" which means to agree, support, or advocate. The 'o' in "Toko" is pronounced like the 'o' in "or" so the correct way to say it is "tore-core" not "toe-coe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has the power to make change and to create a more just, fair and sustainable society. So, if you want change, TOKO is a good place to begin! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toko.org.nz/"&gt;www.toko.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	“Con job” is the word being used to describe the climate change targets the New Zealand Government will be putting on the table at the Paris Climate Conference in December.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Shockingly, the just-announced target is actually worse than it was six years ago, says Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government has said it will aim for a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 emission levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“On paper it may look ok, but it’s a distraction from the fact that it’s not an improvement on any of our previous targets at all - it’s a con-job,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels is equivalent to cutting emissions to 11% below 1990 levels – the year the measurement has always been based on in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“So it’s actually far worse than the 10-20% we pledged to cut by 2020 at the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009,” Boxer says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more tellingly, the NZ Government has not stated in today’s announcement that it has changed its position from last year in regards to the targets not being legally binding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Those in power who are meant to be representing the best interests of Kiwis can bandy about any figures they like, but guess what - they won’t actually have to stick to them if this plan goes ahead.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Real and tangible climate action is needed now, says Boxer, because targets without any sort of plan to achieve them are completely meaningless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In his seven years at the helm of our country, John Key has failed to introduce a single piece of law to reduce climate pollution – that’s not going to change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the government’s own figures, the increase in total emissions by 2020 will be almost 30% worse than it was in 1990.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-ENDS-&lt;/p&gt;

	The six climbers who safely intercepted, scaled, and set up camp on an Arctic-bound Shell oil drilling rig in the Pacific have come down today after spending almost a week on the 38,000 tonne platform.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The multi-national team of volunteers abseiled off the rig and into inflatable boats, before returning to the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, which has been stationed close by for the last week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have camped on the Polar Pioneer for the last six days and have shared GoPro videos, tweets, and live interviews from the rig, shining a light on Shell’s plans to drill in the Alaskan Arctic in less than 100 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, Shell requested a temporary restraining order from a US federal court in Alaska to remove the six from the Polar Pioneer. The US does not have jurisdiction, Greenpeace has said, as the the rig is in international waters. Yesterday (Friday local time), a federal judge in Anchorage declined to rule immediately on Shell's request, saying she would make a decision in one or two days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, worsening weather conditions at sea, which could bring swells of up to seven metres, mean the six are leaving the rig before any ruling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aliyah Field, from the US, one of the six volunteers on the rig, said: “We are coming down today and it fills me with a wide range of emotions. This has been the single most proud, humbling, and inspiring experience of my life.  I am truly in awe of all the support and passion from around the world. A global movement has grown even stronger over the last days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I might be climbing off this oil rig, but this is merely a transition into the next step of saving the Arctic. I can't wait to join the millions of voices, the volunteers in Seattle, and all Americans who believe we deserve better, safer, cleaner forms of energy. My voice cannot be silenced, and neither can the millions of others taking a stand against Shell.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johno Smith from New Zealand, another one of the six, tweeted from the Polar Pioneer: “It's been a HUGE week. And Shell, I know you will read this. This is history unfolding &amp;amp; people will continue to take action. #TheCrossing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoe Buckley Lennox from Australia, another one of the six, tweeted: “6 days ago there were 6 of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now millions climb down with us. Shell tried to silence us but only made our message LOUDER. #TheCrossing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie Leonard, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, said: “I am so inspired and impressed by the volunteers' decision to climb Shell’s drill rig. I hope everyone who sees what they did are inspired to take action in their own way, to help save the Arctic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It's astounding that Shell seems to think it has the right to jeopardize our environment and our economy, without being accountable to society. I thank the climbers for being society's eyes and ears on Shell’s rig, letting them know that millions of us are watching their every move, because there is simply no such a thing as ‘safe’ drilling in the Arctic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Polar Pioneer, which is being transported on a 712 feet (217 metres) long heavy-lift vessel called Blue Marlin, is one of two drilling vessels heading towards the Arctic for Shell this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second, the Noble Discoverer, is one of the oldest drill ships in the world. In December 2014, Noble Drilling, one of Shell’s biggest Arctic sub-contractors and owner of the Noble Discoverer, pleaded guilty to committing eight felonies in connection with Shell’s failed attempts to drill in the Arctic Ocean in 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both the drilling vessels are crossing the Pacific and are expected to arrive in Seattle before heading to the Chukchi Sea. Shell intends to use the port of Seattle as a base for the company’s Arctic fleet, but the company is facing growing opposition from a range of Seattle-based groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 35-person crew on board the Esperanza has tailed the Polar Pioneer for more than 7,000 nautical miles, since it left Brunei Bay in Malaysia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six climbers, who did not interfere with the navigation or operation of the vessel, are Aliyah Field, 27, from the USA (@aliyahfield), Johno Smith, 32, from New Zealand (@nsp_one), Andreas Widlund, 27, from Sweden (@widlundandreas), Miriam Friedrich, 23, from Austria (@mirifriedrich), Zoe Buckley Lennox, 21, from Australia (@zoevirginia) and Jens Loewe, 46, from Germany (@jens4762).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The launch of the Oil Free Seas Flotilla this week is a symbol of hope for a clean energy future said Greenpeace today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This is an inspiring example of courageous kiwis doing their bit to stand up against deep-sea oil exploration around New Zealand and the dangers risky fossil fuel extraction poses to our oceans, coastlines and way of life. This week the nation spoke on TV3’s The Vote - New Zealanders do not want a fossil fuel future. A clean economy is the way forward” said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is providing operational support and will be participating in the flotilla as sponsors of the SV Vega.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Vega is a boat with a long history of peaceful protest at sea.  Skippered by co-founder of Greenpeace, the late David McTaggart in the 1970’s, the Vega made numerous voyages to Mururoa to protest against Nuclear Testing in the Pacific. On one trip the Vega was rammed by a French military warship and the following year on another voyage, McTaggart was severely beaten by French military police.  Oil Free Seas Flotilla spokeswoman Anna Horne was on that voyage in 1973 and photographed McTaggart’s assault. The Vega is now skippered by Daniel Mares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the proud kiwi tradition of protest at sea this flotilla has been formed by a group of individuals who strongly believe New Zealand is in danger of damaging the unspoiled oceans that are at the heart of who we are as a nation.  Deep-sea drilling undermines our chance for a prosperous, clean energy future” said Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla will set sail over the next week, heading directly to the drilling site 110 nautical miles west of Raglan. The first boat to leave, Tiama, skippered by Henk Haazen, departs at 2pm today from Bluff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texan oil company Anadarko (found liable for the Gulf of Mexico spill (1)) is due to start drilling at a depth of 1500 meters later this month, using the untested drill ship the Nobel Bob Douglas. They intend to drill a second exploratory well at 1100 off the Otago coast early next year (2014).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Earlier this year, the Government announced a new law to ban aspects of protesting at sea. Now known as the ‘Anadarko Amendment’, it states ‘that it is illegal to interfere with any structure or ship that is in an offshore area that is to be used in mining activities, with an exclusion zone of 500 meters.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealanders have a right to have their say and we will not let a ban on protest at sea stop us. Protest is a democratic right and we will be upholding that right” said Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We invite the public to join with us in wishing these brave New Zealander’s godspeed in their peaceful protest against deep sea oil drilling”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The departure events are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday 8th at 2:00pm from Bluff (City Wharf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday 11th at 12noon from both Auckland (Princes Wharf) and Kaikoura  (Fisherman’s Wharf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday 12th at 12noon from the Bay of Islands (Opua)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday 14th at 10:00am from Wellington (Queens Wharf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oilfreeseasflotilla.org.nz/"&gt;The flotilla website is here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) February 22, 2012, US District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, Judge Carl Barbier concluded: “Liability for OPA [Oil Pollution Act] removal costs and damages is joint and several, vis-à-vis BP and Anadarko and the subsurface discharge. Furthermore, because it is undisputed that BP and Anadarko were owners of the offshore facility, BP and Anadarko are liable for civil penalties [under the Clean Water Act]”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact information:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna Horne, Spokesperson for the Oil Free Sea Flotilla, 021 0222 1389&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Mares, Skipper of SV Vega, 021 72 9991&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, energy campaigner, Greenpeace: 021 927301 &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/new-zealand/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/6aa0e6ea633963b4cb06baec42051c88.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Wellington, July 8: The four Greenpeace activists who climbed to the roof of Parliament House last month in order to expose the government's failure to act on climate change will attend their initial court appearance on the day of the 30th anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2015/Real%20Climate%20Action/Wellington%20Parliament16.JPG" alt="" width="600" height="339"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbers Johno Smith, Jeff Harrison, Abi Smith and Verena Maeder scaled Parliament at dawn on June 25 with a delivery of six working solar panels. They also unfurled a large banner targeting the Prime Minister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Cut pollution, create jobs? Yeah, nah” read the banner text, which sat alongside a smiling headshot of John Key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The group stayed on the roof for the day, connecting with people around the world using social media applications such as live-stream app, Periscope. Their phones and computer were charged by the solar panels they had up there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Friday, July 10, the climbers will receive confirmation at Wellington District Court about what charges they are facing for the action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coincidentally, this is also the 30th anniversary of the day when French secret service agents, on orders from their government, planted two bombs on the hull of the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior, and sunk it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Fernando Pereira, who was part of the crew, was tragically murdered in the blast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bombing will be commemorated with a photo exhibition, celebrating New Zealand’s history of activism and protest, at The Cloud on Auckland’s Waterfront starting this Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before it was sunk, the Rainbow Warrior had been preparing to lead a flotilla of NZ boats to protest against France’s nuclear testing programme at Moruroa in French Polynesia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climate campaigner Simon Boxer says the coincidental timing of the court appearance and the 30th anniversary is fitting.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In 1985, the Rainbow Warrior crew were preparing to leave their families, their jobs and their homes, to get onto a ship, sail across the Pacific and into a nuclear testing zone in Moruroa, with the sole aim of stopping a nuclear explosion there," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today, nuclear tests in the Pacific have been halted, thanks to all the people who kept standing up in the thousand different ways it takes to change the course of history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our four activists who climbed Parliament House a couple of weeks ago are a continuation of that legacy. They’re willing to take on legal risks in order to stand up for the most urgent issue that the planet has ever faced – climate change – at a time when our government is letting us all down terribly.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday the government announced the climate change target New Zealand will be putting on the table at the Paris Climate Conference in December.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is equivalent to cutting emissions to just 11% below 1990 levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boxer describes the new target as a “con job” that is actually worse than what was pledged six years ago at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, when the NZ government said it would conditionally cut emissions to 10-20% below 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But the most shocking thing is not that the government is putting forward such a low target - it’s that at the moment even 11% is not achievable because there is no plan going forward,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The way we’re heading, and by the government’s own figures, the increase in New Zealand’s total emissions by 2020 will be almost 30% worse than it was in 1990.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-ENDS-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div class="leader"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years, Greenpeace has vigorously advocated for sustainable and equitable tuna fisheries in the Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s vision for a transformed tuna fishery in Pacific Island countries includes the following key aspects. Methods of fishing used would be pole and line, troll, handline, free-school purse seine and best-practice longline. Tuna species would be harvested&lt;br&gt;at sustainable levels, with minimal bycatch. Tuna fishing vessels would be owned and operated by Pacific island communities and local entrepreneurs. Artisanal and village-based fisheries would be organised as cooperatives, to coordinate the sale of their catch and to set the strategic direction for their fishery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fish caught would be processed in the Pacific Islands region for canning, as well as for the high value-added and fresh or frozen tuna markets and would be ‘traceable’ down the supply chain. Products from such fisheries would receive independent verification of both environmental and social standards that can also ensure higher prices are fetched on the international market compared to unsustainable products.&lt;/p&gt;

A huge fleet of over 5000 vessels roams the world’s oceans with almost no control mechanisms in place to ensure that their operations are legal, sustainable and ethical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is largely operating outside of modern fisheries management due to resistance from flag states and industry to properly regulate and manage this fishing sector within the five Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), who are responsible for the world's tuna fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to massive overfishing and depletion of the target species bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tuna. It also amounts to a huge and unsustainable annual catch of vulnerable and endangered marine animals such as turtles, sharks and seabirds. This report will uncover all the issues, the key players and the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Texan oil giant Anadarko’s plans to drill in New Zealand waters are set to be challenged in the High Court.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace today filed papers at the High Court of New Zealand in Wellington asking for a Judicial Review of the decision to allow Anadarko to carry out drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s Environmental Protection Authority made an ‘error in law’ by allowing Anadarko to go-ahead without looking at several key documents, including reports on oil spill modelling and emergency plans to deal with an oil spill, according to the legal papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Greenpeace are asking for the matter to be ‘allocated an urgent hearing date’ due to the ‘national importance of the issue’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Greenpeace’s challenge is successful, it could bring a halt to Anadarko’s drilling plans, as they should not have been given permission to drill because the requirements of the law were not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor Nathan Argent said: “The government’s process appears to have a hole in it so big that an untested 230 metre-long drilling ship has been driven through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen these documents, so we don’t know what’s in them. Apparently government ministers haven’t seen these documents, so they don’t know what’s in them. And even the EPA, who gave the go-ahead to Anadarko, haven’t seen these documents, so they don’t know what’s in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This not only looks shockingly lax, and a complete contrast from government claims that oil companies have been put through the wringer, it also now looks like this was not lawful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal development comes as Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace’s executive director, says that she will be leaving the site where Anadarko intend to drill, around 100 miles off the west coast of New Zealand, to continue the campaign in the High Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Vega, a small boat which has been within 500 metres of the Noble Bob Douglas drilling ship for the last week, Bunny McDiarmid said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been here for over a week now, and we’re heading home determined to carry on this campaign for a cleaner, more prosperous New Zealand. We’re really happy to have had the support of thousands and thousands of Kiwis who don’t want risky deepsea drilling.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Suva - Greenpeace activists yesterday deployed a floating banner at a harbour in the Pacific, reading: “Fewer boats more fish WCPFC Act Now!” 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This message is directed at the members of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), who are meeting in Cairns, Australia next week. Greenpeace is urging the Commission to halt the entry of new industrial fishing vessels into the region and to introduce sharp cuts to tuna catches as recommended by scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacific tuna stocks are in decline with bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tunas now all in need of urgent management action to ensure future sustainability and livelihoods for the region’s vulnerable coastal states. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is the 10th meeting of the Commission (1) and it is time that its members stop ignoring the science and put strong precautionary measures in place to ensure overfishing is halted and that the number of vessels in the fishery is urgently capped and capacity reduced,” said Duncan Williams of Greenpeace Australia Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the blame for overfishing is placed on the large international purse seine fleet originating from the US, Taiwan, Korea, Spain, China and Japan that for much of their catch relies on destructive fish aggregation devices or FADs. The purse seine fishery was responsible for over two thirds of the more than 2.5 million tonnes of tuna fished out of the Pacific last year alone.\ (2). This method catches large amounts of juvenile tuna leading to steep stock declines, particularly of bigeye and yellowfin tunas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Purse seine vessels can fish without using destructive FADs, their use needs to be banned now. Tuna caught this way is already being widely rejected by consumers and the industry can benefit from the increased demand for more sustainably caught products if they act now,” said Sari Tolvanen of Greenpeace International.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace warns that coastal communities dependent on tuna for food and livelihoods are already suffering due to inaction by the Commission. Just a few days ago the handline association of General Santos in the Philippines called on the WCPFC to act now in order to save the stocks and the people who depend on them (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Unfortunately the little people are forgotten in these negotiations as the multimillion dollar company CEOs exert pressure on country delegations to block progressive measures. We certainly hope governments here this week act to ensure sustainable fisheries and livelihoods instead of just protecting the next executive pay check of the rich and the powerful,” continued Tolvanen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The region's longline fleets, catching tuna for sashimi and the American albacore market are also largely seen as being out of control and unregulated, with rampant under-reporting and illegal fishing taking place, especially in the high seas (4).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For too long the massive foreign longline fleets in the region have plundered fish with impunity. They now need to be brought under control, catches reduced, number of vessels reduced to sustainable and economical levels and the high seas pockets closed to all fishing,” added Williams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a sustainable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40% of the world’s oceans as the necessary steps to leaving future generations with oceans able to sustain life on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information about Greenpeace’s efforts at the WCPFC, please visit: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/Greenpeace-briefing-for-WCPFC-10/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Ends--&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1)  http://www.wcpfc.int/meetings/10th-regular-session-commission&lt;br&gt;(2)  http://www.wcpfc.int/node/3561        &lt;br&gt;(3)  http://bit.ly/1a73a6G&lt;br&gt;(4)  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/out-of-line/&lt;/p&gt;

	The 30th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior will be commemorated with a photo exhibition, celebrating courage and protest, at The Cloud on Auckland’s Waterfront starting this Friday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 8px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/2015/CourageWorksV1-400.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="192"&gt;The exhibition, which has its official opening at 10.30am on 10 July, 30 years to the day the Warrior was bombed, shows 30 images of iconic, plus some less well-known, moments of protest in New Zealand’s history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Fernando Pereira was killed when French agents bombed the Greenpeace ship in 1985.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Running until Sunday, the exhibition, which is free and open to everyone, features work from photographers including Gil Hanley, John Miller and Jos Wheeler, who also curated the show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 30 images cover protests in New Zealand including apartheid-era Springbok rugby tours, the Vietnam War, the occupation of Bastion Point, nuclear testing in the Pacific, Maori land marches and deep sea oil drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Sunday, Greenpeace will be hosting, also at The Cloud, and for the first time in New Zealand, an open workshop showing the tactics, thinking and training that Greenpeace and others have employed before and during high profile protests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, head of Greenpeace New Zealand and a crew member of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985, said: “30 years ago the French bombed our ship and killed our friend, Fernando. But they failed to bomb the courage of millions of people. And now nuclear testing in the Pacific has been stopped, because of those people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Rainbow Warrior bombing is one story in our country’s rich history of protest. This exhibition is a real celebration of the courage New Zealanders have shown, and continue to show, to stand up for what they believe in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fernando was a photographer, and this exhibition is also a celebration of the courage of the photographers, like Fernando, who document these hugely important events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The photo exhibition is taking place on the mezzanine floor at The Cloud, Queen’s Wharf, Auckland on Friday 10 July, Saturday 11 July and Sunday 12 July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The workshop will be running twice on Sunday, from 9am until 12.30pm and from 1pm until 4.30pm, also on the mezzanine floor at The Cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/about/ships/the-rainbow-warrior/rainbow-warrior-bombing-30th-anniversary/"&gt; For more information click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Five Greenpeace activists stormed on-board a New Zealand Government ship in Wellington this morning and are now locked to it, after discovering it has been searching for oil.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says the NIWA taxpayer-funded climate and ocean research boat, Tangaroa, has been refitted at a cost of $24 million for oil and gas exploration, and is now surveying for oil on the East Coast of the North Island on behalf of petroleum giants Statoil and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, three activists got on-board the vessel and locked themselves to the top of its mast, while a further two are secured to the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climbers are preparing to unfurl a sail-shaped banner from the mast, reading: “Climb it Change”, while the remaining activists have attached other banners all over the boat with the same message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tangaroa had been preparing to leave Wellington Harbour, where it had made a pit stop, to continue oil exploration. The Greenpeace group have likely delayed it from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest comes just days before the Paris Climate Conference, where world leaders including Prime Minister John Key are supposed to be meeting to agree on how to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Steve Abel, says the John Key-led Government are completely dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now, as John Key gets ready to head out to Paris for climate change talks, this taxpayer-funded science ship that should be doing vital environment work is trying to head out to survey our waters for the climate-wrecking oil industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s yet another example of the National Government’s “obsessive” oil agenda, says Abel, and contradicts climate science which says most of the Earth’s oil needs to stay in the ground if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Tangaroa is trying to find oil, which the industry then wants to burn, heating up our planet. This will cause global suffering, including for thousands of families in New Zealand and the Pacific who could be forced from their homes by extreme weather and rising seas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel says “Climb it Change” is a nod to civil disobedience and the fact that people power and action is what is stopping the fossil fuel industry all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The People’s Climate March this weekend is an example of that. It’s set to be the biggest climate mobilisation in history, and hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, including in 33 towns and cities throughout New Zealand, are expected to hit the streets and take a stand for the climate. We need to take the power back and protect our children’s future.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Climate groups around the world are outraged at a speech delivered by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key this morning at the Paris climate change conference, where he called for the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies despite doing the exact opposite at home.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Key’s musings went down so badly that New Zealand was given the ‘&lt;a href="http://www.climatenetwork.org/node/5403" target="_blank"&gt;Fossil of the Day Award&lt;/a&gt;’ by global group of NGOs, Climate Action Network (CAN).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister had presented a communique by ‘Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform’, of which the New Zealand Government is a founding member, requesting that governments adhere to a set of overriding principles in order to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says Key’s contribution at the first day of the climate conference was “nothing but empty words”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s fundamentally hypocritical to call on others to remove fossil fuel subsidies, while increasing them at home. It’s no wonder New Zealand received the very first Fossil of the Day to be awarded at the conference.” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Although our Government may claim otherwise, on our home turf we have been subsidising the oil industry to the tune of &lt;a href="http://awsassets.wwfnz.panda.org/downloads/wwf_fossil_fuel_finance_nz_subsidies_report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;$46 million a year&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, National is now refusing to reveal just how big these tax breaks and subsidies currently are.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just last week, five Greenpeace activists occupied the government-owned and taxpayer-funded climate and ocean research boat, Tangaroa, for 10 hours, which was about to head out to sea to carry out oil surveying on behalf of petroleum giant Chevron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science ship, which Norman says should be doing vital environmental work, has been refitted at a cost of $24 million so it can also do oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There’s something really wrong with this picture, and now these contradictions between what our Government says and does are being highlighted on the world stage,” he says.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;French President François Hollande set the tone of the UN conference with an opening speech that included recognition of the fact that climate action is a matter of survival for some countries attending the conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that for nations like low-lying Pacific Islands, a goal to making the world powered entirely by renewable energy by the middle of this century is vital. He also said that any agreement reached must be binding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand is proposing that targets agreed on should not be legally binding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have one of the weakest climate action plans and poorest pollution reduction records of all the developed nations attending the talks in Paris,” says Greenpeace’s Norman. “Our Government is such a negative force at these talks that it would be better if it wasn’t there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland – The world's longline tuna fisheries are out of control, and distant water fishing powers and Pacific island countries need to increase their management and oversight, Greenpeace warns in a new report launched today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report, &lt;em&gt;'Out of line, the global failure of tuna longline fisheries’&lt;/em&gt;, (1) outlines the main environmental and social impacts of the tuna longline fishing business, arguing that governments responsible for the management of longline fisheries, either in their capacity as flag States or through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, are not living up to their obligation to ensure these fleets operate sustainably (2). This includes ensuring adequate control of fishing activities, keeping the capacity of these fleets in line with precautionary limits and minimising the impacts of fishing on the whole ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace recommends that Pacific island countries should increase their involvement and management of longline fisheries in the region, and ensure they are operated to a much higher standard environmentally and socially, and contribute more economically to the region (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific also needs tougher measures in place to reduce fishing capacity overall and meeting the social and environmental criteria set out by Greenpeace for ocean friendly fishing (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With histories of destructive fishing practices and poor compliance we expect that many of the foreign longliners operating in the Pacific currently would fail to meet our criteria for fishing access,” said Duncan Williams, Oceans Campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large international trading companies often facilitate supplies and operations of longline fisheries. Taiwanese FCF, Japanese Mitsubishi and Itochu as well as Singapore/US based Tri Marine are the main traders of longline caught tuna, which they sell to markets in Japan, elsewhere in Asia or as canned albacore products in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The behavior of longline tuna fisheries is scandalous, with regular reports of poor practices such as illegal fishing facilitated by at sea transfers of fish, labour law abuses involving captive crews who can spend several years at sea and the killing of vulnerable species like sharks and turtles,” said Sari Tolvanen, Oceans Campaigner at Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand government is this month considering whether to ban shark finning in New Zealand, a move that Greenpeace is urging (5). Greenpeace recommends this should be implemented in our longline fisheries according to international best practice, which is a requirement for sharks to be release back into the sea or landed whole with their fins naturally attached, and is urging people to make submissions calling for a ban on shark finning (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here in New Zealand, our government claims to operate a world-class fisheries management system, yet the longline tuna fishery is dragging its heels. Target species include critically endangered southern bluefin tuna, and shark finning is legal and widespread in our longline tuna fishery”, said Karli Thomas, Oceans Campaigner at Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few weeks the future of the world’s largest tuna fishery will be decided in Cairns, Australia. Members of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission need to agree on far-reaching cuts in the region's bigeye and yellowfin tuna catches. Longline powers mainly from Taiwan, China, Korea and the US are expected to resist further efforts to limit longline fishing in the high seas – measures that would ensure critical improvements in fisheries management to achieve more sustainable and legal Pacific fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for sustainability and equity standards to be implemented without delay by the key traders, market players and fishing operators active in the longline tuna sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Action cannot be delayed any longer and it is essential that this fishing business starts accepting proper management and conservation rules. Only by getting larger players to act will it be possible to bring this highly fragmented fishing sector under control,” added Tolvanen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Ends--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Thousands of Kiwis flocked to beaches around the country today to demonstrate their opposition to deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand waters.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Banners on the beach’ activities attracted crowds to more than 45 North Island west coast beaches as well as a few on the east coast and in the South Island. The nationwide event, organised by a coalition of groups, coincides with the continuing protest by the Oil Free Seas Flotilla about 100 nautical miles off the coast of Raglan, where oil giant Anadarko intends to start drilling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Texan oil giant Anadarko has not yet started to drill, although its yet untested drilling ship, Noble Bob Douglas has been on site since Tuesdaymorning. The Greenpeace sponsored yacht Vega has remained within the exclusion zone of the Bob Douglas since its arrival. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organisers say the largest crowd was at Piha where more than 1000 gathered with banners for speeches and a haka. Other crowd estimates are Raglan, 650, Muriwai, 400 and Bethells Beach, 500.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Steve Abel says the huge turnout will have sent a strong message to the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Today Kiwis have drawn a line in the sand saying quite clearly they don’t want deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand waters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The government’s decision to allow Texan oil company Anadarko to drill in New Zealand waters is scheduled to face a judicial review in the High Court on Monday 9 December at 10am.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The hearing will examine whether it was lawful for the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to register Anadarko’s Environmental Impact Assessment for drilling activities as ‘complete’, thereby giving the ‘green light’ for drilling, without having seen eight key documents. Lawyers for Greenpeace will argue that this was unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko’s emergency oil spill response plan and the company’s own oil spill modelling report are two of the eight missing documents. Neither of these two documents have so far been publicly released, despite being requested in Parliament and through Official Information Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight documents are part of the Discharge Management Plan, which is a section of the Environmental Impact Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minister for Energy and Resources Simon Bridges has repeatedly claimed that exploratory deepwater drilling “is a highly regulated area where we put businesses like Anadarko through the wringer” &lt;a title="" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#142bf6eb4094bb79__ftn1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly-formed EPA, created in June 2012, is the lead agency responsible for overseeing this ‘wringer’. “New Zealand deserves no less than a world-class regulatory system that reflects our environmental values in conjunction with our economic interests. The Environmental Protection Authority, which this bill establishes, will do just that” &lt;a title="" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#142bf6eb4094bb79__ftn2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, the government has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court hearing is expected to see government lawyers arguing that it was acceptable for the EPA to have allowed Anadarko to drill without having seen the eight key documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the prospect of the High Court witnessing government lawyers contradicting the above claims made by the energy minister and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has repeatedly submitted that the process is too permissive and contrary to international obligations to “protect and preserve” the environment, as it fails to provide adequate protection for our oceans and the communities and local economies that depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a timeline, showing key developments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 September: Anadarko lodge their Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), minus the eight missing documents, with the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 September: the EPA notify Anadarko that the oil company’s Environmental Impact Assessment for drilling activities is ‘complete’, thereby signalling their consent for drilling. The eight documents, including vital information about the oil spill modelling are, however, missing from the documents assessed by the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 October: Maritime New Zealand confirm that it is still assessing crucial information about Anadarko's proposed drilling activities which will form part of the Discharge Management Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 October: Simon Bridges states in the House, in response to a question from the Greens concerning the oil spill documents: “They are not publicly available in the sense that they are there on websites necessarily for everyone to see. But they are, through Official Information Act and other processes, able to be obtained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 October: Greenpeace submit an Official Information Act request for the above information from Maritime New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 October: Anadarko’s drillship the Noble Bob Douglas leaves Korean shipyard destined for New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 November: Maritime New Zealand confirms that they have signed off the Discharge Management Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 November: Maritime New Zealand declines the OIA request, asking for an extension to 13 December, the day after Parliament goes into recess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 November: Anadarko drillship the Noble Bob Douglas arrives at the location where they propose to drill, around 100 nautical miles off the west coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 November: the Minister for Environment Amy Adams confirms that she is “advised by the authority [the EPA] that although it did not see the version of the discharge management plan that was finally approved by Maritime New Zealand it does consider that it received sufficient information to satisfy its obligations” &lt;a title="" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#142bf6eb4094bb79__ftn3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;November: Anadarko announces that it has started drilling activities. Greenpeace file papers at the High Court requesting a judicial review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight documents are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.     Vessel Documents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.     Baseline Environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.     Drill Cuttings Dispersion Modelling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.     Oil Spill Modelling Reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.     Emergency Oil Spill Response Plan / Oil Spill Contingency (including Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.     Well Control Contingency Plan (Well Control and Source Control Emergency Response Plan, Logistics Plan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.     Environmental Monitoring for Exploration Activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.     Marine Protection Rules Part 170 Appendix&lt;/p&gt;

	Reacting to the Paris Agreement at the conclusion of COP21, Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It sometimes seems that the countries of the United Nations can unite on nothing, but nearly two hundred countries have come together and agreed a deal. Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it’s what happens after this conference that really matters. The Paris Agreement is only one step on a long road, and there are parts of it that frustrate and disappoint me, but it is progress. This deal alone won’t dig us out the hole we’re in, but it makes the sides less steep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The deal sets out the objective of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, but the emissions targets on the table take us closer to 3 degrees. That’s a critical problem, but it’s one with a solution. Renewable energy is already doing heavy-lifting across the globe, but now its moment must come. It’s the only technology mentioned in the Paris Agreement. There’s a yawning gap in this deal, but it can be bridged by clean technology. We’re in a race between the roll-out of renewables and rising temperatures, and the Paris Agreement could give renewables a vital boost. The wheel of climate action turns slowly, but in Paris it has turned.” He added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not a moment for triumphalism given the lives that have been lost already as a result of climate impacts, and the lives that are on the precipice as temperatures rise. This is a time for urgent action. The climate clock is ticking and the window of opportunity is closing fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

	The absence of deep sea oil permits in the Government’s just-announced 2015 block offer is another “nail in the coffin” of New Zealand’s oil programme, says Greenpeace executive director Dr Russel Norman.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning it was revealed that nine new petroleum exploration permits have been granted, six of which are offshore, and none of which are in deep water. Of the almost 430,000 square kilometres offered, there were only successful bids on 12,000 of them. All of these are in the Taranaki region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says the fact that none of the permits are for deep sea drilling, despite the fact the Government has been fervently pushing a deep water agenda, is proof that the Prime Minister’s oil drilling programme is failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “John Key has continued to insist that we must look for the very oil that we can’t burn if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change, despite evidence that it’s a dying industry,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t be surprised if the lack of deep sea permits is because no oil companies actually showed interest in sticking around in New Zealand deep water next year. It’s no longer financially viable: The market worldwide is experiencing massive failure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Brazil had its worst permit offer process in a decade, when only a small fraction of the permits offered were taken up by oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International oil giants such as Shell and Statoil didn’t even bother to submit any bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar situation is occurring in deep sea permitting for the US Gulf of Mexico, where the number of new permits are half that of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in New Zealand, Statoil has just revealed it lost more than NZD $33 million (USD $22,384,160) in 2014 from its oil exploration work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss appeared in the oil giant’s 2014&lt;a href="https://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/service/services/documents/23CB062DEBE7B9AF2B091D1E20A055D5"&gt; annual report&lt;/a&gt;, which was released several weeks ago, but has been unreported until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says John Key is “completely reckless” for continuing to push of an oil agenda that is “clearly dying”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To date, no deep sea oil has been found here, and despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent, John Key obsessively continues to insist on subsidising the oil drillers with taxpayers’ hard earned cash,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just think of the jobs that could have been created if Government time and money had been spent on cheaper, cleaner and smarter options like solar and wind. It’s an outrageous betrayal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon his return from the Paris climate change conference earlier this week, Key stated he had no plans to cut back on the mining of oil, gas and coal in New Zealand, despite calling on the world to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry at the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The just-announced offshore oil permits have been awarded to OMV NZ Limited, Todd Exploration and Mont D’Or Resources Limited.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a “breathtaking display of hypocrisy”, John Key is preparing to dish out new oil exploration permits just days after returning from the Paris climate change conference.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says he expects the Government will announce the latest round of these oil ‘block offers’ before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In Parliament you can’t call someone a hypocrite, but what other word makes any sense of a Prime Minister who stands on the world stage and says he cares about climate change and then comes home and approves plans to find and burn huge stores of underground carbon? That is breathtaking hypocrisy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John Key’s job should be to present a tangible plan to help combat climate change and protect our children’s future, but instead he’s doling out permits to look for the very oil that we can’t burn without irreversibly wrecking the climate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the block offers are almost always declared during the last sitting week of Parliament before Christmas, which is this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on previous announcements, it’s likely that hundreds of thousands more square kilometres of New Zealand water will be handed to foreign petroleum giants for oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says it would be a disaster for New Zealand and its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is one thing John Key can do to have some credibility on climate change: Cancel the oil exploration agenda immediately,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since August, dozens of communities around the country have joined together to pressure their local councils to “block the offer” and say “no” to oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christchurch, Dunedin and Kaikoura City Councils listened to their constituents and voted in favour of telling Central Government that oil surveying is not welcome in their waters. Auckland Council was evenly split with Len Brown’s vote in favour of oil drilling breaking the deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Paris climate conference, the New Zealand Government was criticised for its inadequate offer to reduce its contribution to global climate change. It even picked up the very first ‘Fossil of the Day Award’, a booby prize given out by global NGO coalition, Climate Action Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the talks, Pacific Island nations have been forced to form an alliance with the EU and against New Zealand and the block of countries trying to prevent a binding and ambitious agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just last night, the world’s annual Climate Change Performance Index was released, revealing that of the 58 countries ranked for climate change performance, New Zealand came in 42nd - a significant drop from 35th last year.&lt;/p&gt;

	Brand new climate minister Paula Bennett has today been slammed after praising a report for the United Nations that reveals New Zealand is on track to increase carbon pollution by 30% in 2030.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is despite the Government’s promise at the Paris climate change talks that it would do the opposite, and reduce emissions by 30% on what they were in 2005 by 2030.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But a &lt;a href="http://t.sidekickopen32.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs7d-glFVRbFsg2BW0nTVQBcsP56dM-ff45GsGK02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fmfe.govt.nz%2Fnews-events%2Fnew-zealand-meets-kyoto-climate-target&amp;amp;si=5345586682789888&amp;amp;pi=f7bcdb71-d0b2-4bfd-e634-b465d0705fa5"&gt;statement just published&lt;/a&gt; by Bennett ignores these statistics and instead praises the fact the report shows New Zealand has met its target for reducing emissions under the first commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. New Zealand met its Kyoto commitments by buying fake carbon credits from the Ukraine to cover the increase in emissions in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace executive director, Dr Russel Norman, says it’s embarrassing that New Zealand’s climate minister is being positive about such a “train wreck” of a result.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “It’s downright misleading,” he says. “This report actually shows that contrary to what we’ve been told, and what was promised in Paris, the Government’s very own projections show we will blow our emissions out of the water in the years to come.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “These official figures show that the Government’s weak promises to tackle climate change pollution are a train wreck.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Paula Bennett’s got to get a grip of her new job. This first outing really doesn’t bode very well at all.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The electricity companies conducting a behind-the-scenes fight to keep New Zealand’s last coal-fired power plant at Huntly alive are an “absolute disgrace”, says Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/294834/energy-leaders-discuss-industry-future" target="_blank"&gt;it was revealed&lt;/a&gt; that several of New Zealand’s electricity industry leaders have been meeting with Huntly owner Genesis Energy in an attempt to subvert an earlier decision to close the last two coal fired electricity generating units in 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These companies claim they’re concerned killing coal could result in a shortage of power during dry periods, but I don’t buy it,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even New Zealand’s Electricity Authority has come forward and said closing Huntly won’t result in a shortage of power, dry year or not. And if there are ever any real issues around supply of electricity, then innovation and forward-thinking when it comes to renewables is something we expect of our electricity providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s ridiculous that  just one month after nations of the world met together in Paris and agreed to cut emissions, we’re still debating whether or not to use  climate destroying coal fired power here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s absolutely disgraceful that companies like Meridian, which is sold on a clean energy image, are supporting dirty coal. They, along with other electricity companies, have a duty to their customers to look for cleaner solutions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

Together, we are calling for world leaders to protect the Arctic and fight climate change. We believe melting sea ice is a warning, not simply a chance to drill for more oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this unique ceremony at the top of the world we will offer respect to those who came before us and hope for those yet to be born.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace International has today named not only its first female International Executive Director, but two. Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid will take up the reins in an innovative co-leadership role on 4 April 2016. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Bunny McDiarmid and Jennifer Morgan. © Greenpeace" src="/international/Global/international/photos/greenpeace/2016/Bunny-McDiarmid-Jennifer-Morgan.jpg" alt="Bunny McDiarmid and Jennifer Morgan. © Greenpeace" width="600" height="390"&gt;Bunny McDiarmid, left, and Jennifer Morgan, right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny is a 30-year veteran of the organisation as an activist, ship's crewmember, and most recently the executive director of Greenpeace New Zealand which, under her leadership, became a powerhouse of innovation in the Greenpeace world. Bunny has walked the decks of nearly every Greenpeace ship. Jennifer has walked the corridors of power. As Global Director of the Climate Program at the World Resources Institute she's dealt with heads of state and CEOs. She's been a leader of large teams at major organisations, a climate activist, and a constant innovator. Her other ports of call have included the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Climate Action Network, and E3G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Board Chair Ana Toni, "We knew that both of these proven leaders could do the job on their own. But, when we looked at their amazingly complementary skills and experience, the blend of knowledge they would bring, and the challenges we know this job presents to any single individual, we looked back over the literature of co-leadership and were compelled by one of its core advantages: resilience. And so, we decided to seize the amazing opportunity of the two of them co-leading the organisation. It's a move consistent with our general shift away from being a highly centralized, hierarchical organisation, to one that is leaderful: one in which everyone is empowered and where responsibilities are shared."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Morgan was born in the US, lives in Germany, and got her masters degree in International Affairs at American University. She remembers clearly the day she found a slim book, Fighting for Hope, by Petra Kelly, founder of the German Green Party, in the student lounge. "I didn't move for the next several hours. I read the entire thing in one sitting. Kelly linked systemic problems and the need for new ways of thinking, she talked about the role of violence in society and the importance of reconnecting with nature as if someone had written down everything in my heart and mind that I hadn't been able to express. I found her incredibly courageous, and she became a role model for me in a way that changed my life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know this sounds corny, but coming to Greenpeace feels like coming home. I've been out in the world, I've walked among government leaders and the halls of the corporate world. Greenpeace is much closer to my roots, and has this incredible advantage in its independence: the policy of refusing government or corporate donations means there's no need pull punches for fear of offending anyone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny McDiarmid was born in New Zealand, and says she tried lots of "-isms" while she was at Canterbury University to explain the world she was growing up in. She wasn't won over by anything – until she found herself, at 21 years old, on a wooden boat, replacing rotting pieces of timber below the waterline in preparation for going to sea with a community of 12 people. "I had no carpentry or sailing experience, and this was a job that could mean sink or swim if I got it wrong. But people trusted me, believed I could do it, and I learned then and there that you can be more than what a piece of paper says you can be." Bunny was a deckhand aboard the Rainbow Warrior in 1985, when Greenpeace moved the people of Rongelap from their island home that had been contaminated by radiation from decades of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. "I saw a confluence of connection in the violence we do to Earth and the violence we do to people, and I was witness to how little it mattered to those who were doing it. The story of Rongelap was a tiny metaphor for a far bigger story that drew me in, and bonded me to the ideas that Greenpeace stands for."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ana introduced the two through a series of meetings beginning in October, where Jennifer and Bunny have gotten to know each other and found their visions, their ideas about leadership, and their people-centered styles compatible: their ease with one another is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're both trust-builders. We both encourage respectful challenge cultures. We both believe you create highly effective teams by harnessing diversity of thought and approach," said Bunny. Jennifer notes that women are particularly good at sharing power. "We're good at bridging diversity. We're good at focusing on outcomes and a cause. And while there are plenty of men who could share the helm of Greenpeace, there is something that Bunny and I can do through our leadership to empower young women to dream about their futures – that they can do anything and rise to anything, be it the head of Greenpeace or a head of state."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer has been described as an "anti-bureaucrat," building nimble teams within large structures. "It's about the right people, matched to the right goal, rather than structures or organograms. And it's about building a vision together, step by step, rather than having it imposed. Nothing has been more gratifying to me than creating conditions in which people can operate at their best, clearing the obstacles in front of them, aggregating diverse views and skills into something bigger than the individual components, and watching them hit their stride. There's no greater reward for a leader than watching talented people succeed and shine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny and Jennifer share a vision of finding a "new edge" for Greenpeace. "People are hungry for a new story that they can believe in, one with a better take on the nature of humanity, the fate of our future, and our connection to the earth and the air and the oceans. Greenpeace is so well positioned to deliver that – you're genuinely working across global divisions of North and South, your commitment to civil disobedience and nonviolent direct action gives you unique credibility in speaking truth to power that few institutions enjoy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we need," says Bunny, "is to make the creative space and find the confidence to figure out how we combine and aggregate the power of everyone who believes in 'Greenpeace the idea' – not 'Greenpeace the organisation'. Not the bricks and mortar, but the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;. How do we combine our rebellious creativity with the rebellious creativity of the millions of people and organisations around the world who believe a better world is possible. How do we empower and accelerate that with humility and urgency?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer concludes: "Neither of us knows what that new edge looks like yet. And it may look different in different places. But if there's a single mission that will mark our leadership, it's finding that, it's trying new things and working together through the entire organisation to find it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This whole approach is new and I'd be worried if we weren't both excited &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a little scared by this," says Bunny. "But in a sense, shared leadership isn't just about me and Jennifer splitting the job of International Executive Director between us: it's about sharing leadership among Greenpeace's worldwide offices, it's about sharing leadership with our supporters. This arrangement is an evolutionary reflection of Greenpeace International's entire approach: it's all about sharing – globally – the power, the responsibility, and the challenge to rise, to become the best we all can be in a time of environmental threat and existential opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we bring out the best in each other, we get a better organisation. If we can bring out the best in humanity, we get a better world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	2015 is officially the hottest year on record according to NASA, news which the executive director of Greenpeace NZ calls “disturbing” for an island nation like New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of hours, climate experts from the space agency made the announcement about what they call “record-shattering” global temperatures in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the late-19th Century, the Earth has warmed about one degree Celsius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s Russel Norman says the results are a clear indicator that climate change is happening now and will have drastic consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We need to be backing 100% clean, non-polluting energy and investing in renewable technology,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Instead, John Key is subsidising and encouraging new deep sea oil exploration. Even in the wake of the Paris climate conference, the Government is fawning over foreign oil companies and helping drive the very pollution that is threatening the places we live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Some of the first countries to bear the brunt of this warming will be the Pacific Islands. For New Zealand and our neighbours, NASA has delivered disturbing news.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says we can expect to see more extreme weather events such as storms, floods and droughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As the planet heats up further, melting glaciers and ocean acidification will lead to sea level rise, and coastal communities will be the first to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The recent report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment showed that the increase in sea levels could force tens of thousands of New Zealand families out of their homes and cost tens of billions of dollars.”     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just yesterday, the Government moved to extend the drought status in the South Island for another six months due to the widespread dry conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a title="NASA" href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-record-shattering-global-warm-temperatures-in-2015" target="_blank"&gt;See the NASA announcement here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Minister Tim Groser must up his game at climate change negotiations in Paris, says Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman today, as Groser refused to publicly back moves to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Russel Norman said: “Groser’s got to up his game in Paris, and show some real leadership. Right now, that leadership is coming from some of the planet’s poorest countries, who have successfully ensured that limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is still on the table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Groser’s so far refused to back this option, which just isn’t good enough. It’s not just a number on some policy document. It could mean our houses don’t get flooded, our air is cleaner, and the future is a little more secure for entire island nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our neighbours Australia have supported 1.5 degrees. So come on, Tim. It’s your last gig before heading off to Washington. Make sure you’re remembered as climate change minister for the right reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Press Release – KASM, Greenpeace, Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.

The New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency should refuse an application to mine phosphate from the deep seabed in the Chatham Rise, because of the damage it will cause to the marine environment, and because the EPA hasn’t got enough information to give it the go-ahead, environment groups said today.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Three groups, Greenpeace, Kiwis Against Seabed Mining and the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, today &lt;a title="Closing Subs" href="http://kasm.org.nz/stopsandmining/assets/KASM-GP-DSCC-Closing-subs-final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;gave their final submission&lt;/a&gt; to a committee hearing the application by Chatham Rock Phosphate to mine phosphate in an area of up to 5000 square km, in depths of up to 450m, off the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer acting for the groups, Duncan Currie, presenting their closing statement, told the hearing that the application was “premature,” due to the lack of information in many areas. “The Environmental Impact Assessment was far from adequate. There’s a lot of information missing, but what we do know that this mining will destroy virtually all life on hundreds of square kilometres of the seabed, including rare, vulnerable and endemic species,” said Currie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of damage that it could cause included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of deep sea corals, sponges and other deep sea life, and the hard surface they need to survive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mining will create a plume including toxic materials, with high levels of uranium, and the plume will smother everything for hundreds of square kilometres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information on marine mammals is woefully deficient. The company did not even carry out a marine mammal survey. The evidence on noise was partial and incomplete, and the company did not even try to estimate the noise created by a 450 metre long pipeline carrying rocks and sediment up and down to the mining ship. The evidence, including the noise from pump motors the size of a ship’s engine on the seafloor, still shows the mining operation’s capacity to create lasting injury to marine mammals up to three kilometres from the mining site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of the uranium and its derivatives (including toxic polonium, which is known to accumulate through the food chain) on the marine life and food chain are unknown, as was the effects on wider ecosystem, including fish and fisheries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had also overstated the benefit of the phosphates to New Zealand, since it will export 75% of the mined phosphates. The groups also raised the issue of the uranium content in the phosphate. “New Zealand has a number of international treaty obligations, including the Noumea Convention, which have specific requirements about the dumping of uranium that is proposed,” said Currie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hearing it had also become clear that there were numerous enforcement and compensation issues, along with health and safety issues that arise with the proposed mining ship flying a foreign flag of convenience in New Zealand’s EEZ and outside territorial waters. New Zealand has banned foreign flagged fishing vessels in our waters from May 2016 following concerns about breaches of labour and environmental laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company that Chatham Rock Phosphate says will do the mining, Boskalis, will itself use a ship that’s likely to be flying a flag of convenience – from Cyprus,” said Barry Weeber of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boskalis has a history of breaching environmental consents. If its ship is flagged to Cyprus, as its other ships are, how will the EPA be able to control it in our waters?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“We’re sending the company a clear message that New Zealanders don’t want Statoil here drilling for deep sea oil and putting our environment and economy at risk,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Chief Policy Adviser Nathan Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, the Government announced that 15 new onshore and offshore oil block offers had been awarded to companies including Statoil. At the same time a report released at the global climate talks in Peru shamed New Zealand for having a “poor” record on climate action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Statoil’s New Zealand branch office is on the 21st floor of the Vodafone building in Lambton Quay. Activists are stopping entry by adding extra locks to the front door and boarding it up with planks and a sign reading ‘Go Home Statoil’. The sign, featuring Maori motifs, was designed by members of Northland iwi that are opposed to deep sea oil exploration off their coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 1 more than 1,000 people joined the Waiho Papa Moana Hikoi, organised by Northland iwi, when it reached Auckland to protest outside New Zealand Petroleum Summit against plans for deep sea oil drilling in the Reinga Basin. (1) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Statoil_Northland/"&gt;About 19,000 Greenpeace supporters have emailed Statoil&lt;/a&gt; with the ‘go home’ message. (2) This morning activists are also delivering a letter to Statoil with that message and the list of supporters who have taken online action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two weeks ago seismic testing started in the basin as Statoil and other companies search the area for signs of oil where the water is between 1000 and 2000 metres deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Evidence from marine scientists around the world suggests that seismic testing, which involves a ship firing off repeated underwater sound blasts 24/7, is bad for whales and dolphins,” says Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report (3) to the UK Department of Trade and Industry in 2007 shows the lethal range underwater for a large seismic array at seven metres and injury range of 53 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This week the Greenpeace-sponsored yacht SV Vega has taken an independent scientific crew into the Reinga Basin to monitor the impacts of seismic testing on marine mammals off the Northland coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is research the government failed to do before it started issuing permits to big oil companies like Statoil to come here.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year Greenpeace released a computer oil spill modelling report www.oilspillmap.org.nz, carried out by data scientists using industry standard data showing a deep sea blowout could have devastating impacts on New Zealand's coastal waters and damage the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this morning’s barricade of the Statoil office is finished activists plan to remove a sign featuring the company logo and will post it back to the head office in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists confirmed no one was inside the Wellington office before starting the barricade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photos and video will be available later this morning for free download from: https://greenpeace.box.com/s/hejvh8syld6h4s8jc9of&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)      http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/blog/waiho-papa-moana-hikoi/blog/50817/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)      http://grnpc.org/statoil-email-action&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)      http://www.subacoustech.com/information/downloads/reports/565R0212.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Take action #tellshell to get out of the Arctic !&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell has spent $4.5bn buying its way into the Arctic, and the moment of truth has arrived. Right now, two giant drilling vessels are preparing to exploit melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil that is warming our planet in the first place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing that can stop them is people power, &lt;a title="Save The Arctic " href="http://savethearctic.org/" target="_blank"&gt;and we have over 800,000 names on our Arctic scroll ready to join us in the fight to Save the Arctic.&lt;/a&gt; Our politicians are not listening - they care more about the CEOs of fossil fuel companies than they do about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Action ToolKit" href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/arctictoolkit" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s time to take back the power and show what ordinary people can do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOLLOW THE LIVE FEED FROM EVERYWHERE - JOIN US ! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Beach users in the upper North Island are being urged to keep a close eye out for whales and dolphins in trouble this summer.

Greenpeace says marine mammals may be affected by seismic testing for deep sea oil which started off Northland’s west coast in December and will continue for several months. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are distributing hundreds of posters (1) to beach communities encouraging people to report sightings of distressed, stranded or dead whales and dolphins immediately to the Department of Conservation Hotline (0800 HOT DOC). DOC is responsible for post mortems on marine mammals found between New Plymouth and Northland this summer to see if acoustic trauma was a factor (2). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel says evidence from marine scientists around the world suggests that seismic testing may be bad for whales and dolphins and other ocean life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “There is a serious lack of research on the impacts on New Zealand populations. Looking long-term, it’s believed seismic testing could have chronic impacts on their behaviour and ability to navigate, feed, nurture young and find mates (3),” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “In extreme cases, evidence (4,5) indicates it could also injure and disorientate them, leading to stranding and even death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The likelihood of injured or dead dolphins or whales washing up is relatively low at any time but by reporting any sightings immediately there’s a chance of saving them or finding out what got them into trouble in the first place.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Seismic testing is the first step of oil exploration. It is done from a ship firing off repeated sound blasts every few seconds, day and night sometimes over weeks or months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The blasts, created by large underwater air guns, generate a pressure wave that penetrates the seafloor and the reflected sound waves are then recorded by an array of sensors dragged on long cables after the ship. The seismic explosions can be heard over 100kms away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last month Greenpeace helped scientists to monitor the noise and possible impacts of seismic testing on marine mammals off the Northland coast. Early analysis indicates there were sperm whales, pilot whales and common dolphins in the area, but it will be a few months before more detailed data can be released. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The New Zealand government should have done its own research on the impacts of seismic testing before it started giving permits out to big oil companies to start working here,” says Abel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “New Zealanders do not want big oil companies here drilling for deep sea oil and putting our environment and economy at risk.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Aquila Explorer is currently doing seismic testing for Statoil and several other companies in the Reinga Basin. It is well out of range of swimmers and boaties as it is operating many kilometres off-shore.&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest and peatland destruction by ‘sustainable’ palm oil companies, including Fonterra supplier Wilmar, is fuelling forest fires in Borneo, a new investigation by Greenpeace International has revealed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="PDF Download" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/publications/forests/2015/Under-Fire-Eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/artwork/teasers/under-fire.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greenpeace researchers examined three plantations in West and Central Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) where major fires were recorded during the 2015 haze crisis. In each case, there had been widespread deforestation and peatland drainage prior to the fires breaking out. Deforestation and draining of peatland are widely recognised as the root cause of the fires crisis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Palm oil from these plantations is supplied to international markets through commodities traders including Wilmar International, who supply Fonterra with palm kernel expeller, used as a feed for cattle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Indonesia’s fire crisis, the result of decades of wholesale forest and peatland destruction, has put Indonesia’s plantation industries in the global spotlight. Global consumer companies and traders must face up to their role in fuelling this disaster. Existing ‘No Deforestation’ policies and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) membership are not enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; President Joko Widodo has taken the long overdue political step of issuing an official instruction ordering an end to further development on peat – a critical first move toward reversing this destructive commodity-driven legacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The plantation sector – and the global market it supplies – must act quickly and decisively to support the president's reforms and agree industry-wide action to reverse deforestation and improve transparency and accountability within the forestry sector.&lt;/p&gt;

	A coalition of environmental organisations (1), is calling for John Key not to attend the upcoming Paris climate summit, and to pull Tim Groser and the entire New Zealand delegation from the two weeks of talks.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand is proving one of the biggest blocks to a meaningful global deal in December. In the interests of a successful outcome and for the good of the climate, we’re asking that our delegation not go,” said Greenpeace climate campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as having one of the weakest climate action plans and one of the poorest emission reduction records of the developed nations who’ll be in Paris (2), the New Zealand delegation also wants countries’ emission targets to be non-binding under any agreement, meaning governments could walk away from their targets at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world’s ability to manage climate change rests on these targets; they must &lt;em&gt;legally &lt;/em&gt;oblige  governments to reduce emissions. To call for them to be non-binding is to admit defeat from the outset,” said Niamh O’Flynn from 350 Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tim Groser and our delegation’s remit will be to prevent a Paris agreement that commits New Zealand to more climate action,” said Cindy Baxter of Coal Action Network Aotearoa. “They’ll be doing everything they can to bring everyone down to New Zealand’s level, in which case the world will be heading for at least 3-4 degrees of warming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International analysis has found New Zealand’s pledge to reduce emissions by 11% by 2030 on 1990 levels to be “inadequate” and key elements of the policy little more than “creative accounting”. (3)  The analysis says in reality, New Zealand’s emissions are set to be 11% &lt;em&gt;above &lt;/em&gt;1990 levels by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every head of state, delegate, civic leader, civil servant, NGO representative, man and woman at the December summit should have only one objective in mind – to reach a meaningful global deal that keeps our children and grandchildren safe,” said Steve Abel of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand’s position won’t get us where we need to go; in fact it will drag us in the wrong direction. Our Government has shown neither the courage or fortitude required in Paris. It is not up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be better for humanity if John Key were to stay home, and instruct Minister Groser and the delegation to do likewise.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is urging tuna traders and investors to fill the void created by the Western and Central Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)’s failure to manage Pacific tuna fisheries. “In the absence of any real action at this week’s WCPFC talkfest, the market end of the supply chain must step up and use their influence to ensure both they and Pacific tuna have a future,” says Lagi Toribau of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Government representatives who met in Samoa this week for the 11th session of the WCPFC not only failed the countries they were there representing, they also failed the Pacific. Dooming the region’s fisheries with their inability to reach agreement over urgently needed rules to halt declines and give tuna stocks time to recover from overfishing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “If members represent only their industrial fishing interest, the WCPFC cannot function. Bigeye tuna are overfished, albacore fisheries are no longer profitable, and yellowfin and even skipjack tuna are starting to buckle under the strain of a fishery out of control. What was their response? Five days of talk and no real action,” says Toribau. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; No new rules were added to the WCPFC’s tropical tuna conservation and management measure, despite last year’s record high catch of bigeye tuna by purse seiners using FADs, and the latest stock assessment revealing overfishing has driven the stock down to just 16%. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “This is completely unacceptable and the governments that make up this Commission need to be held accountable by their people. The commission failed to pass a single one of the proposals put forward by Pacific Island Nations to save these fish – and the fisheries that depend upon them.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lack of consensus also thwarted attempts to stop the demise of the region’s albacore fisheries. “The failure at WCPFC has left Pacific Islands’ albacore fisheries dead in the water,” says Toribau, “Last year, despite the declining stock driving Pacific fleets out of business, China’s delegation declared that its industries wanted to build up to one hundred more longline vessels to target South Pacific albacore. (1) Under the pressure of its distant water fishing industry, the Chinese government this year refused to accept limits on this fishery.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Pacific countries took matters into their own hands last week, agreeing the Tokelau Arrangement to cooperatively manage South Pacific albacore. Unfortunately distant water fishing nations did not join the effort at the WCPFC, leaving the high seas an albacore free-for-all that is sucking the life out of the fishery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Reacting to this systemic failure, Greenpeace turns its attention to the markets. “International tuna brands should ensure their suppliers are not involved in driving Pacific fisheries collapse, or partner with distant-water fishing powers that are expanding their longline fleets or plundering bigeye with the use of FADs – all the while blocking conservation rules from being adopted”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On sharks, the Commission failed to adopt proposals from the Pacific and European Union that would have clamped down on shark finning. “This leaves it in the hands of tuna brands to ensure that their supply chain doesn’t produce shark fins as well as tuna cans.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This isn’t the first time Greenpeace has urged seafood traders to lead the way, but the issue has become much more extreme. “Governments are clearly failing in their duty to protect this source of food, jobs and economic security,” says Toribau, “In the absence of real leadership, industry and traders are running Pacific tuna fisheries into the ground. They may not technically be breaking the law, but they’re destroying an industry that dozens of countries, and hundreds of thousands of people rely on for survival.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace urges companies to support sustainable local fisheries and shun fleets that are exacerbating the plunder of Pacific tuna. “They need to act now,” says Toribau. “Supporting sustainability protects their viability, and we’ll hold them to account if they do not.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; End&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Paragraph 345 of the &lt;a href="http://www.wcpfc.int/system/files/WCPFC%2010%20FINAL%20RECORD_1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Meeting Summary of WCPFC 10, December 2013&lt;/a&gt;.

	Reacting to the news today that Shell will once again be delaying their plans to drill in the Great South Basin, Greenpeace New Zealand’s climate and energy campaigner Steve Abel said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“National's deep sea drilling plans are failing. The collapse in the oil price has brought the industry to its knees globally as dangerous and expensive drilling plans including deep sea are being canned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the same week that Shell abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic, it has put its reckless bid to drill in New Zealand on ice. We think it is very unlikely that Shell will return,” said Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government has spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars opening up our oceans to some of the world’s biggest polluters, yet one by one companies like Exxonmobil, Petrobras, Anadarko have pulled up the anchor chains and left, all without having found any oil. It now looks like Shell will follow too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A smarter Government would abandon its failing deep sea drilling plans and focus on building a cleaner and safer future for New Zealand".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This would create many tens of thousands of jobs and a multi-billion dollar boost to the economy. At the same time we would safeguard our oceans from oil spills and  reduce pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But the fight to stop deepsea drilling off in our oceans is not over. We still have Statoil and Chevron wanting to drill but they are facing greater and greater local opposition. There are currently &lt;a href="https://www.toko.org.nz/efforts/block-the-offer" target="_blank"&gt;13 local community campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to pressure regional councils to reject ‘Block Offer 2016’ in the current consultation with Iwi and councils.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact details:&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, climate and energy campaigner on: 021 927 301&lt;br&gt;Nathan Argent: press office on: 021 971234&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace calls for urgent action to protect the economic and environmental sustainability of key Pacific tuna stocks as major tuna interests meet in Apia for the 11th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Pacific tuna are in serious trouble. Bigeye tuna is overfished, down to 16% of its original population, and yet, as the China Tuna Industries failed IPO demonstrates, fishing companies continue to hammer them like there’s no tomorrow,” says Lagi Toribau of Greenpeace, “it is time for the WCPFC to tackle unchecked overfishing, and ensure member countries follow the rules or face stiff penalties.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“To address the ongoing decline of bigeye tuna, the Commission has to tackle FAD use,” continues Toribau, “the data makes it absolutely clear that FADs have a devastating impact on juvenile bigeye, and unless the WCPFC declares a total ban on FADs, this meeting is just talk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FADs are currently banned for a four-month period each year, a rule that Greenpeace says, demonstrates an awareness of the damage FADs cause, but the four-month ban is inadequate. Backed by strong scientific evidence and worrying stock decline, Greenpeace says any use of FADs by purse seine fleets is unacceptable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While purse seiners are taking huge catches, longline vessels are also overdue critical attention. They continue to take the most valuable fish and give the least back to Pacific Island nations. Longline vessels fish the Western and Central Pacific Ocean in vast numbers, many of them sticking to the high seas and transshipping via reefer. “The longliners are all take and no return,” says Toribau, “they’re not even reporting operational level data from their fleets, so no one has a full picture of what’s really going on out there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling for longline fleets to be reduced and more tightly regulated. The high seas should be closed to all fishing, and the Commission must ban transshipment at sea; a practice that enables fleets to hide illegal fishing, labour abuse, shark finning and other illicit practices. This is the side of tuna fishing that the industry wants to keep out of sight. China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan do not even provide the operational level data they are obliged to share with the Commission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These days consumers want to know where their food is from, and be sure it comes from sustainable and ethical sources. Complex supply chains hiding dodgy or illegal behaviour are no longer acceptable” says Toribau. “Transparency and ethical behaviour is in everyone’s best interest.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albacore, the bread and butter of Pacific Island fisheries, needs to be managed far more sustainably than it is at present. Countries must adopt a new Conservation and Management Measure for albacore and an interim target reference point of 70% to recover the stock to a level where local Pacific fleets are viable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Pacific is at a crossroads and this meeting in Apia will decide the fate of the region's most important natural resource,” says Toribau. “The current path will only lead to devastation, with loss of livelihood, economic instability for Pacific countries, and the collapse of the world's favourite fish."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace calls on the WCPFC to ban FADs, close the High Seas, and ban transshipping at sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;End&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s High Court loss for Tim Groser and his TPP secrecy bid, Greenpeace chief policy advisor Nathan Argent said:

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This is a humiliating judicial slapdown for Tim Groser and his anti-democratic moves to hide the TPP text from the people of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This judgment is clearly saying that Groser’s excuses for refusing to release information about the TPP were wrong.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The New Zealand government has got to release the full text immediately, so we can all see for ourselves what is in this deal because, right now, all the indications are that the TPP has been concocted solely for the benefit of foreign companies and their sharp-suited billionaires, not for the people of New Zealand. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The current government is flouting Official Information Act requests left, right and centre, over a range of issues, and today’s judgment is surely a warning that they cannot continue to do so.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This is great news for supporters of transparency and openness. And bad news for those, like Tim Groser and the rest of the government, who appear to favour secret negotiations with big corporates over open conversations with ordinary New Zealanders.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groser withheld the information on a “blanket basis” without looking at any documents, which is a breach of his obligations under the Official Information Act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, Thursday 1 October - The four Greenpeace activists who climbed the roof of Parliament to expose John Key’s failure on climate change have been convicted of wilful trespass with an order for reparations of $750 per activist in the Auckland District Court.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“We remain proud of what we did and we are happy to take full responsibility for our actions,” said Johno Smith, one of the activists.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climbers Mr Smith, Jeff Harrison, Abi Smith and Verena Maeder scaled Parliament at dawn on June 25 with a delivery of six working solar panels. They also unfurled a large banner targeting the Prime Minister.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Cut pollution, create jobs? Yeah, nah” read the banner text, which sat alongside a smiling headshot of John Key.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The group stayed on the roof for the day, connecting with people around the world using social media applications such as live-stream app, Periscope. Their phones and computer were charged by the solar panels they had up there.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The New Zealand Government is failing New Zealanders over the biggest issue of our time,” said Mr Smith.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We are willing to take legal risks because we believe New Zealand can and should be at the forefront of global efforts to tackle climate change. There is as much opportunity as there is challenge in making the transition to a smarter, cleaner economy.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Zealand is proving one of the biggest blocks to a meaningful global deal at the Paris climate talks in December.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As well as having one of the weakest climate action plans and one of the poorest emission reduction records of the developed nations who’ll be at the summit (1), the New Zealand delegation wants countries’ emission targets to be non-binding under any agreement, meaning governments could walk away from their targets at any time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;International analysis has found New Zealand’s pledge to reduce emissions by 11% by 2030 on 1990 levels to be “inadequate”. (2)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“John Key’s record on climate change is an embarrassment, and our country is being held back by a “can’t do” attitude that is a betrayal of the true values and spirit of New Zealanders," said Mr Smith.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has called on John Key to pull the delegation from the Paris talks, saying a strong climate deal could rest on New Zealand absenting itself completely.

	Responding to this morning’s TPP deal announcement, Nathan Argent, chief policy advisor for Greenpeace New Zealand, said:


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The TPP is a shady deal cooked up behind closed doors, and the details are still being hidden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The New Zealand government has got to release the full text immediately, so we can all see for ourselves what is in this deal. Their continuing refusal only gives weight to those who believe this is a bad deal for New Zealanders, and a slap in the face for democracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “All the indications are that the TPP has been concocted solely for the benefit of foreign companies and their sharp-suited billionaires, not for the people of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The inclusion of so-called investor state dispute settlement clauses gives special legal rights to foreign investors, which could see our government being sued for, say, stopping the pollution of our rivers if these companies think it would undermine their profits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “From what we can tell so far, and given the government’s withholding of the details, this deal looks like very bad news for New Zealanders, for the seas in which we swim and fish, the air we breathe, and even for our health.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Tuesday, October 27 – Following a staunch anti-drilling stance by other city councils, thousands of Aucklanders have sent a strong message to Mayor Len Brown and his councillors, urging they oppose surveying for oil off Auckland’s coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost 6,500 emails have been sent by the public directly to the mayor and an additional 8,500 have been sent to Auckland City councillors, imploring them to take a stand against deep oil surveying and drilling at a vote on the issue this Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the weekend, Brown indicated to media that he will be among those opposing oil exploration at the vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 185,000 square kilometres of sea in the Northland/Reinga Basin off Auckland’s west coast are currently at stake.  In the event of a deep sea blowout, modelling shows oil could inundate our beaches and harbours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In the area proposed in this block offer, off the west coast of Auckland, the risks of exploration appear to outweigh the benefits," Brown told the &lt;em&gt;Herald on Sunday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In particular, I'm concerned for the protection of the remaining Maui's dolphin population, for Kaipara Harbour, which is nursery to an estimated 95 per cent of West Coast snapper stock, for the shellfish gathering, shorebird habitats and the recreational assets of our beaches."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Steve Abel, who will be making a formal presentation at the meeting on Thursday, welcomes Brown’s strong stance and says he could make or break the vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The mayor made a powerful statement over the weekend that really encapsulates what we hold near and dear to us in this beach and harbour city. It’s promising to see him acknowledging what’s at stake,” Abel says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last time oil exploration was put to a vote in Auckland, council members were split 50/50 for and against. A final casting vote by chair George Wood sided with the oil drillers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this time, and for the first time since the issue has been put before council, the mayor will be chairing the meeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Crucially, this means if it comes to it, the deciding vote will come down to Brown,” Abel says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Auckland Council has a real chance to show leadership, in the same way Christchurch and Kaikoura have, by opposing all oil exploration and drilling off our coasts.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Christchurch and Kaikoura Councils have already come out in strong opposition to deep sea oil drilling. Dunedin Council will vote on the issue this afternoon.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past two months, 25 campaign groups around the country have been rallying their local councils to say “no” to oil exploration. Councils have until the end of this week to make a submission to government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel expects a good public turnout at Thursday’s meeting in Auckland, and Greenpeace has started a &lt;a title="Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1492435731057696/1494086880892581/" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page calling for Aucklanders to attend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Opposing deep sea oil exploration and drilling is a no-brainer for three reasons,” says Abel.  “The risk of an oil spill would be catastrophic for us and would completely destroy our beaches, the seismic blasting used to survey for oil harms our marine mammals like the critically endangered Maui’s dolphin, and then there’s the simple reality that if we want a chance against climate change, we can’t afford to take any more oil out of the ground.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says the New Zealand Government has created a misperception that the exploration is “safe” and doesn’t involve drilling, when that’s not the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Once the Minister of Energy and Resources issues an oil exploration permit, it lasts 12-15 years and requires companies to undertake the riskiest kind of drilling - deep sea exploratory drilling - the very same that led to the world’s worst offshore oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico,” says Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Despite this, there is no point in the process for public to have a say other than at the council level.”    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Auckland City Council vote on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's annual Block Offer takes place in the reception lounge of the Auckland Town Hall at 9:30am, October 29.  &lt;/p&gt;

	Shell announced today that it is retreating from its failed Arctic drilling programme (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The campaign against Shell’s Arctic oil rush began in New Zealand in February 2012 when &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6473000/Lawless-refuses-to-leave-Shell-oil-drilling-ship"&gt;Actor Lucy Lawless and 7 other activists occupied the drillship Noble Discoverer&lt;/a&gt; in New Plymouth port.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then a multi million strong movement against the drilling has formed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Big oil has sustained an unmitigated defeat. They had a budget of billions, we had a movement of millions. For three years we faced them down, and the people won,” &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints"&gt;said Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawless, who has also been active in the campaign for action on climate change, reacted that, “Shell pulling out of the Arctic is a huge win for arctic fauna and people and indeed for all life on the planet. I look forward to the day when fossil fuel companies become Clean Energy companies.  We need them to evolve so that our children can thrive.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April this year another kiwi activist Johno Smith was part of the mid pacific occupation of &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/67625296/kiwi-climbs-pacific-oil-rig-in-greenpeace-protest.html"&gt;another Shell drilling rig&lt;/a&gt; and celebrated today’s news with a facebook post, “YEAH BOY!! Shell is Pulling Out of the Arctic.. 7 billion dollars wasted.. Not one drop of oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace activists in Portland &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/29/activists-hang-from-bridge-portland-block-shells-arctic-oil-vessel"&gt;also blocked Shell’s effort&lt;/a&gt; to depart for the arctic a few weeks ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell &lt;a href="http://www.shell.co.nz/aboutshell/media-centre/news-and-media-releases/2014/great-south-basin-jv-parties-decide-to-drill.html"&gt;still has plans to drill for deep sea oil&lt;/a&gt; in the Great South Basin of New Zealand this coming summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Shell’s Arctic drilling has failed because it's too risky, too expensive and there is too much public opposition. It's high-time for Shell, Statoil and other deep sea drillers to quit New Zealand too. Climate action means we’ve got to leave that oil right where it is - under the sea floor," said Greenpeace NZ climate and energy spokesperson Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) &lt;a href="http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/media/news-and-media-releases/2015/shell-updates-on-alaska-exploration.html"&gt;Shell's announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is challenging New Zealand’s biggest company, Fonterra, to prove that its massive use of palm products is not fuelling the enormous fires raging across Indonesia.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Millions of people across South East Asia are facing a catastrophic smog problem due to the fires, which are caused by the systematic destruction of rainforests and peatlands by the relentless clearing of land for palm plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described as the biggest environmental crime of the 21st century, the fires are also rapidly destroying the habitat of a third of the world’s wild orangutans and other endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is now on track to release more carbon dioxide this year than the entire United Kingdom; and in just three weeks, the fires have released more CO2 than the annual emissions of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand’s Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says it’s important for New Zealanders that Fonterra urgently provides credible evidence that its massive use of palm products to feed dairy cows is not contributing to the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand is the single biggest importer of Palm Kernel Expeller (PKE) in the world. Almost one-third of the global trade in palm kernel is bought by New Zealand, mostly for the dairy industry,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades of rampant expansion by the plantation industry in Indonesia has lead to out of control fires in and around their plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fonterra buying huge volumes of PKE from these plantations to feed the expansion of industrial dairying in New Zealand clearly links them to the fires, destruction of rainforests and peatland, massive greenhouse gas emissions, and unprecedented human suffering as a result of the smog from the fires,” Dr Norman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this is the case, we’re complicit in the biggest environmental crime of this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra has recently admitted that the use of PKE is affecting their image as a grass-fed dairy supplier, so now is the time to stop using this unsustainable product and move to a cleaner, smarter way of dairying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Dr Norman wrote a letter to Fonterra CEO, Theo Spierings, requesting an urgent meeting to discuss the dairy giant’s palm kernel supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace then received a letter written on behalf of Spierings, declining the invitation, citing too short notice. It suggested a meeting with a different colleague instead. It's also offered claims of sustainable sourcing, which Dr Norman says are simply not credible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is insisting on meeting Spierings himself, given the seriousness of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re talking about devastation of enormous scale - something that’s been described as one of the worst environmental disasters in history,” says Dr Norman. “It’s imperative that Fonterra front up and prove that New Zealand has not been complicit in fuelling these fires.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, October 29: Auckland Mayor Len Brown made his position on deep sea oil drilling clear today as he voted against an amendment to oppose exploration for oil off Auckland’s west coast.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Until now, the mayor has not taken a public position either way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Steve Abel, who &lt;a href="http://councillive.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/video/291015-governing-body-item-07-parts-01" target="_blank"&gt;made a formal presentation&lt;/a&gt; at the council meeting, says Brown’s vote was a “cop out”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Essentially, he’s backed deep sea oil drilling today by voting against an amendment that would have clearly stated that Auckland opposes deep sea oil drilling,” Abel says. “It all came down to Brown, and Brown let us down.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dozens of people with placards attended the Auckland City Council meeting, where councillors voted on Auckland’s submission to the Government in regards to oil exploration and drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the lead up to the meeting, over 15,000 emails were sent to Brown and his councillors, imploring them to vote against any surveying or drilling off Auckland’s coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at the meeting, Brown said taking a symbolic stand against the issue would do no good for the council’s relationship with the Central Government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was his vote that was decisive and led to the council's failure to oppose risky drilling at the final head count of 11-9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had Brown opposed surveying and drilling, the votes would have been tied on 10-10. Then as chair of the meeting, his casting vote would have decided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says it all came down to Brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The council meeting is the only formal point in the process where the public can have their say on the issue of awarding foreign petroleum companies licenses to explore our seas for oil. Brown even acknowledged this, saying the public have ‘no other port to call at’ than local councils in terms of opposing drilling, yet he chose to not give the public opposition to drilling any voice,” he says.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He went against the spirit of statements he has often made about the value of our oceans, harbours and beaches. Len Brown has failed our oceans, our coastlines, our climate and the people of Auckland.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-        -   ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling for members of the public to take part in a co-ordinated demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity in Auckland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning the organisation launched the campaign, described as an “escalation in protest tactics”, which will culminate at the conference on March 21.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climate campaigner Steve Abel says despite years of public opposition and a failure to find any deep sea oil, John Key’s Government has continued to invest in deep sea drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Everyone who is concerned about this should come and join us for civil disobedience at the oil conference. Every year for the past three years, thousands of New Zealanders have marched up to the petroleum summit to show they are not ok with this Government’s oil agenda,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s reached the point where we need an escalation. We can’t sit by while climate-change drives extreme flooding, storms and droughts that threaten our communities and livelihoods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we are to have a future, the oil industry can have no future. It’s plain mad that John Key continues to prop it up. Climate change is the defining struggle of our generation and it needs to be dealt with now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says public participation is one of the most effective tools for creating change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should take inspiration from people like Gandhi, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr, and the movements here in New Zealand that opposed apartheid and made us nuclear free,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the face of Government inaction it’s going to take people power to secure the future we urgently need - one that’s run on 100% clean energy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace hinted at the peaceful civil disobedience event when a short video appeared on its social media pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clip features people wearing black-tie attire at SkyCity, holding a large card that reads, “What’s on the cards here at the oil conference on March 21?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says Greenpeace isn’t publicly releasing specific details of what the peaceful demonstration at the petroleum summit will look like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We want some things to be revealed to Key and his oil industry chums on the day, but we will be giving ongoing information to all those who are interested in being part of this.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The month of February has experienced a whopping temperature rise never seen before in the history of record-keeping, according to just-released global satellite data.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Russel Norman says temperatures around the planet, including in New Zealand, have experienced such a spike that the world would be “crazy” not to act immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on the data that’s just been put out it’s pretty clear that February has obliterated our previous record-setting month. It’s completely unusual, even taking El Niño into consideration. Doing something about this right away is a matter of life and death. We can’t afford to muck around,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even the climate deniers, who ironically have used this very satellite data in the past to further their own agendas, have gone very quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action here in New Zealand needs to start with calling it quits on any future oil exploration right away, says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the back of the Paris Climate Conference in January, Prime Minister John Key stated he had no intention of scaling back any search for fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Key is doing less than bugger all when it comes to climate change. And this means we’re facing floods in our homes, and droughts on our farms. We need to make the call now that enough is enough,” says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this will be the year of peaceful protest in New Zealand. We’ve seen it with the TPPA, and we’re going to see it with the oil industry. Next on the agenda is Greenpeace’s day of peaceful civil disobedience in three weeks at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Greenpeace launched the campaign, pegged as an “an escalation of protest tactics”, and called on members of the public to take part in a co-ordinated demonstration of civil disobedience at the conference in Auckland on March 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone who is concerned about news like February’s overwhelming temperature record should come and join us at the oil conference. We need real climate action,” says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to news that state-owned company Landcorp, the country’s biggest dairy farmer, is set to ditch industrial dairy plans in Waikato, Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“If you like swimming in clean rivers, and want New Zealand to have an international reputation as a clean, green country, this is great news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Landcorp are absolutely right. These plans would have resulted in huge amounts of pollution from the dairy industry damaging our rivers and lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s especially significant that the government’s own dairy farmer is conceding that an expanding dairy industry is not consistent with clean rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We simply cannot continue to have an industrial dairy industry like we currently do, and also expect to have clean water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And that’s why we need to change the way the agricultural industry works. It’s about time we saw more of these polluting plans, including irrigation schemes like Central Plains Water in Canterbury, being ditched.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Cat owners who buy Whiskas for their pet may unwittingly be funding modern-day slavery and destructive fishing methods, Greenpeace New Zealand says today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Although most famous for peddling chocolate bars, Whiskas’ owner Mars is also the largest pet food company on the planet. The American company buys tuna and other seafood that goes into its cat food pouches and cans from Thai Union, one of the world’s biggest seafood exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Last year, Thai Union was exposed as being connected to human rights abuses through direct links to fishing vessels and suppliers where workers were exploited, abused and forced to work on ships for years at a time. Thai Union also sources from fishing methods that result in high catches of untargeted species, such as sharks, turtles and rays. Tuna caught on these ships could be ending up in tins of Whiskas sold in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?_r=1"&gt;In an exposé&lt;/a&gt; last year, products from another Mars-owned cat food brand, Iams, were shown to be made in a Thai Union cannery which was processing fish from boats using trafficked and forced labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand have contacted Mars in New Zealand several times in the last few months, asking the company to provide evidence that they are not selling Whiskas cat food tainted by human rights abuses and destructive fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mars have so far failed to provide evidence that their product is not implicated, leading Greenpeace New Zealand to launch a campaign asking cat owners to contact Mars and ask the company to come clean about its Whiskas supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Kate Simcock said: “All too often, modern-day slavery and destructive fishing methods go hand-in-hand. And with these unsavoury elements already lurking in Mars products, it’s clear that Whiskas has some serious questions to answer. Whiskas has so far failed to clear their name on these grave matters, despite clear links to their parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “They've balked at divulging the secrets of their murky supply chain to us, and we’ve seen no evidence that their product is not trashing our oceans and linked to slavery and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We’re sure that cat lovers everywhere will be shocked at this. No-one wants to buy cat food, or anything else for that matter, that reeks of human rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re asking the public to join us and ask Mars a simple question: ‘What’s in my Whiskas?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Mars have got to tell their customers where they get the fish from that goes into Whiskas. And if it is caught by an exploited workforce, or in ways that empty our oceans of tuna, sharks, turtles and other animals, they’ve got to clean up their act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Just over three months ago, Nestle, which owns Purina Fancy Feast, admitted that its pet food products have been linked to human rights abuses and promised to clean up its supply chain. Nestle claims that all companies sourcing seafood from Thailand will face the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	 A “dirty deal” between big business and the Government to sideline the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and strip it of some of its powers is being considered after the watchdog declined two seabed mining applications.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/government-considers-changes-to-epa-after-mining-applications-rejected" target="_blank"&gt;One News revealed&lt;/a&gt; the deal would remove the EPA’s power to appoint an independent board to assess marine mining applications, and instead the Minister for the Environment, Nick Smith, will hand pick a board of inquiry himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, was interviewed during the news segment and calls the move a “dirty back-door deal” that takes any integrity out of the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s like being able to choose one of your friends to mark your exam paper rather than having someone independent do it – it’s ludicrous,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The EPA was created by the Government in 2009 to act as an independent environmental regulator. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time, MP Nick Smith lauded its establishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Creating an EPA was a 2008 election promise by National and will strengthen New Zealand's environmental management. It will help achieve the Government's goal of growing our economy while effectively protecting our natural environment,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, the watchdog has declined two applications for seabed mining because of the environmental impacts: The first, an iron sand mining project proposed by Trans-Tasman Resources Limited in June 2014; and the second, an application by Chatham Rock Phosphate Limited in February this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman doesn’t believe it’s a coincidence that these rejections could be closely followed by Smith being handed control over choosing the decision making from now on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ever since the EPA declined those mining applications, lobbying efforts from the industry went into overdrive. Now the Government is putting the profit of this polluting industry over the interests of most New Zealanders who want to protect our beaches and oceans,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It has basically rendered the entire process pointless and made it nothing but a political rubberstamp. This is about a government that is fixated with mining and oil exploration and now needs its minister to step in and protect the interests of an industry that is throwing its toys out of the crib.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS -&lt;/p&gt;

	World-leading environmentalist Bill McKibben is today urging New Zealanders to take part in peaceful civil disobedience to overthrow “radicalism”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The well-known American has made the call in a &lt;a title="Youtube link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi9Yfe_ez7k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, which has been released by Greenpeace, five days before members of the public will participate in a Greenpeace-organised demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity in Auckland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It will be the first time in New Zealand that Greenpeace has invited the general public to take civil disobedience action en masse.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McKibben, who founded global climate change organisation &lt;a title="350.org" href="http://350.org/" target="_blank"&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt;, recorded the video in support of the action on March 21.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a personal message to the New Zealanders taking part, McKibben said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We thank you in advance for being willing to stand up peacefully and non-violently to the most violent forces on our planet.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He says New Zealand is one of the most “beautiful places in the world” but now stands as a place that needs to get serious about the climate crisis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Everybody went off to Paris [climate conference]. Everybody said lots of sweet things. Everybody pounded each other on the back about what great people they were,” he says.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“[But] if you come home from Paris and say ‘nothing is changing – we’re still going to mine coal, we’re still going to go drill in the deep blue sea for oil, we’re still going to frack’, then you did not get the message.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the back of the Paris Climate Conference in December last year, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key stated he had no intention of scaling back any search for fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McKibben has words of encouragement for Kiwis considering using peaceful civil disobedience as a tactic for change.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The point that you’re trying to get across I think, most importantly, is there’s nothing radical about what we’re talking about. All we’re talking about is trying to keep a world that works a little bit like the world worked for the last 10,000 years,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The radicals [are the] oil companies and the government ministries that aid and abet that…[It’s] our job, with our bodies if need be, to slow down that radicalism…Civil disobedience is a powerful tactic - it needs to be done with a complete commitment to non-violence and peacefulness.”&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning Russel Norman, Greenpeace’s executive director, has demanded that ‘Genesis Energy must close Huntly’s coal-fired generators by 2018.’

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the Genesis CEO the Greenpeace boss says that it is ‘frankly shocking that less than three months after Paris, Genesis and other power companies are colluding on strategies to keep coal burning in New Zealand rather than on strategies to cut pollution.’&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;‘You will no doubt be aware that Greenpeace has successfully campaigned for clean energy and against coal power around the world’, Russel points out in the letter, which has been copied to other energy companies including Contact Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, TrustPower.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;‘People power will win the battle at Huntly coal’, Russel says, before adding that ‘I hope it need not come to that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=47701"&gt;A petition was also launched today here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the full letter here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To: Genesis Energy CEO Albert Brantley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;CC: Contact Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, TrustPower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Mr Brantley,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re: The closure of Huntly coal fired power station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your recent statements that Genesis has been in negotiation with other power companies to keep Huntly’s two coal-fired power plants open past 2018 are deeply disappointing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Paris Climate Summit (COP21) New Zealand pledged to cut carbon pollution to keep temperature rises below 2C and aspire to a target of less than 1.5C. This places an obligation on Genesis and others in the New Zealand electricity industry to stop burning coal.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is frankly shocking that less than three months after Paris, Genesis and other power companies, most of which are majority publicly owned, are colluding on strategies to keep coal burning in New Zealand rather than on strategies to cut pollution. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year we celebrated your wise decision to close Huntly in 2018. This is exactly what should happen in a world seeking to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change. The aging Huntly coal-fired power station should close and strategies implemented to achieve a 100 percent clean energy grid, including a just transition for workers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace takes a firm stance that, consistent with your original plan, Genesis Energy must close Huntly’s coal-fired generators by 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will no doubt be aware that Greenpeace has successfully campaigned for clean energy and against coal power around the world. We are proud that our campaign played a pivotal role in redirecting Mighty River Power away from the Marsden B fossil folly and into geothermal generation. It was a win-win outcome for people, the climate, Greenpeace and Mighty River. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;For us, and for so many New Zealanders like us, clean energy and a stable climate is a defining issue of our age. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your decision to close, or not, the Huntly coal fired power station will be a defining issue of your leadership at Genesis. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It will either be a decision that you look back on with pride, knowing that you played an important role in giving our kids a stable climate and setting New Zealand on a low carbon pathway. Or it will be a decision that you look back on with shame, as you try to explain to the young people in your life why you had a chance to contribute to a stable climate but instead chose to continue with business as usual towards a climate abyss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choice is yours. Which side are you on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know which side we are on, and we know which side large, and growing, numbers of New Zealanders are on - they want a stable climate for their kids, not more coal. This is an issue New Zealanders care about, and we will be letting New Zealanders know about this. People power won the battle of Marsden B and, if necessary, people power will win the battle at Huntly coal as well. But I hope it need not come to that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I look forward to hearing back from you. We would very much like to let our supporters know that you will stay on the responsible side of history on this important decision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kind Regards,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Russel Norman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executive Director ,Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In this latest investigation Greenpeace tested a range of outdoor gear for hazardous per- and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFCs). The study reveals that not only outdoor clothing and footwear but also camping and hiking equipment such as backpacks, tents and sleeping bags contain chemicals that are hazardous to the environment and to human health.

&lt;p&gt;This follows an analysis conducted on items produced and sold by various outdoor brands, selected for testing by outdoor enthusiasts and Greenpeace supporters. This is the first time a Greenpeace product testing investigation has been designed with the participation of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 40 products that were tested, only four were found to be free from the per- and polyfluorinated chemicals that were investigated, to the detection levels used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows that chemicals that are known to be hazardous, among them substances of very high concern such as PFOA and other long chain ionic PFCs, are still being widely used for products sold by outdoor brands. At the same time the tests show a shift in the type of PFCs being used towards short chain PFCs – chemicals that are also persistent but less well researched in some aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation also shows that volatile PFCs such as long and short chain FTOHs (fluoro telomer alcohols) are used in high concentrations, leading to considerably higher extractable concentrations in many final products.&lt;/p&gt;

	The five Greenpeace activists who stormed on board a New Zealand Government climate research ship that was found to be searching for oil have been discharged – and will receive no punishment – after being convicted at the Auckland District Court today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The five were convicted of being unlawfully on a vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November Siana Fitzjohn, Kailas Wild, Adrian Sanders, Genevieve Toop and Niamh O’Flynn locked themselves on board the NIWA taxpayer-funded climate and ocean research boat, Tangaroa, which had been chartered by petroleum giant Chevron to survey for oil in New Zealand waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two initial arrests, three of the Greenpeace group managed to remain up the gantry of the boat for more than 10 hours, and used social media to connect with people around the country. They also unfurled a sail-shaped banner, reading: “Climb it Change”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tangaroa had been preparing to leave Wellington Harbour, where it had made a pit stop, to continue oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its oil and gas capabilities come from a $24 million taxpayer-funded refit it was given in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist Siana Fitzjohn says she locked herself to the boat to highlight the Government’s “absolutely dishonest” agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Tangaroa should be conducting science in the public’s interest, not serving the agenda of the oil industries that are destroying our climate,” she says. “It is sadly ironic that this vessel is enabling oil companies to threaten our ocean, when ‘Tangaroa’ means ‘God of the Sea’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While John Key assured the world at the Paris Climate Conference that we would take real action on climate change, he continues to push a deep sea oil agenda that endangers our communities. Further exploration for fossil fuels should be seen as an act of violence against humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Responding to today’s &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=11605904&amp;amp;ref=NZH_Tw"&gt;MRAG Asia Pacific report into IUU fishing in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, Greenpeace campaigner Oliver Knowles said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is daylight robbery, clear and simple. A resource that belongs to the Pacific community is being stripped out by illegal operators, many of them from countries far away from the Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The issue belies a serious problem – that tuna fisheries in the Pacific are not well controlled or policed. On top of the illegal catches, there is also the huge problem of destructive, wasteful and unsustainable fishing that is legal. The two combined are putting huge pressure on Pacific tuna stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we’re serious about protecting tuna fishing in the Pacific governments need to invest more in policing and monitoring fishing to put pressure on the illegal operators.  They also need to take strong action to clean up the legal operators by phasing out wasteful operations like purse seining with Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) and reigning in destructive and exploitative tuna longlining by banning transhipments at sea.”&lt;/p&gt;

	As of last month, there was not a single petroleum company searching for oil in New Zealand using exploratory drilling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Simon Boxer, says the news is “extraordinary” and sure to be concerning for the John Key-led Government, which has continued to push an oil agenda here, despite evidence that its programme is failing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Plummeting oil prices have meant that everyone is in a hurry to pull out of the New Zealand market, because despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that has been pumped in by oil companies and by our Government using taxpayer money, no deep sea oil has ever been found,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“No new jobs have been created – in fact many have lost their jobs – and we’ve seen zero economic benefit from it. The revelation that there is currently no exploratory oil drilling in New Zealand at all, anywhere, is extraordinary – it’s a nail in the coffin of Key’s obsession with oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also another sign that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the rest of the world when it comes to climate change and investing in a clean energy future, says Boxer. Unlike the volatile oil market, renewable energy prices are stable and jobs and profit in the sector are growing exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re getting left behind. There’s a new clean economy just around the corner, with new jobs and new prosperity. New Zealand is already rich with natural renewable resources – we’re just not investing in them. Let’s hope this oil failure is enough to knock some sense into our so-called leaders.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-ENDS-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today’s announcement that the Government will contribute funding to a city rail link in Auckland despite Prime Minister John Key’s past resistance to it, shows that public pressure is working, says Greenpeace’s executive director Russel Norman.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;During his lunchtime State of the Nation speech, Key revealed the Government would formalise its $2.5 billion funding commitment from 2020, which will allow the main construction on the City Rail Link to begin in 2018 - two years earlier than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a huge win for people power,” says Greenpeace’s Norman. “John Key and the National Party have been dead-set against funding a rail link for years – in fact, they’ve made very disparaging comments about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact Key has changed his tune now, shows he’s buckled under the massive pressure applied by the public, transport campaign groups and the Auckland Council. It’s fantastic news and will make a big difference for all of us living here in Auckland, as well as have a flow-on effect to the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course, it could have been done sooner, but it is nonetheless a huge victory for people power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City Rail Link will also help reduce our oil dependency and climate pollution, says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“They’re a direct way for people to show their feelings to the politicians and the large corporations, whose interests all too often appear to be in conflict with those of the people. And that’s certainly the case with the TPP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we see more large-scale peaceful protests in New Zealand this year. When it comes to climate change the government are doing less than bugger all. And this means that we’re facing floods in our homes, and drought on our farms. People don’t want that, and that’s why this could be a year of peaceful protest.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Government subsidies for dairy irrigation schemes should be dropped in order to avert a dairy crisis, Greenpeace says today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The government currently has around $120million of taxpayers’ money sitting in a fund, called Crown Irrigation Investments, which is earmarked for controversial irrigation schemes designed to expand industrial dairy agriculture. But it is this model of agriculture which is failing, Greenpeace says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The government hopes to increase the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on these schemes to $400million.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Industrial agriculture is failing, right before our eyes. It’s failing for Fonterra. It’s failing for Fonterra’s suppliers. It’s failing for our economy. It’s failing for people who like swimming in clean rivers. But, perhaps most importantly, it’s failing for farmers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The government is, right now, sitting on millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, which they want to throw at the industrial farming model which has led to this sorry situation. There’s no way they should be backing these irrigation schemes, which make no sense economically or environmentally.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Clean, green, organic farming products are much better for our finances, our farmers and our international reputation. It’s this that the government should be backing, not some failed industrial agriculture model which is polluting our rivers and our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s oil block offer announcement by Simon Bridges, Greenpeace’s senior climate campaigner Simon Boxer said:

 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This looks like a desperate, last-ditch bid by the government to try and save their failing oil plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Last month not one single petroleum company was searching for oil using exploratory drilling. And the government’s last block offer was a massive flop, with not one taker for any deep sea drilling permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s mad that John Key continues to prop up this sunset industry and ignore widespread local opposition from many, including councils. Climate change is the defining struggle of our generation and it needs to be dealt with now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 200 people descended on New Zealand’s largest oil industry conference at dawn this morning and blocked entrances as part of a Greenpeace-organised demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It‘s the first time in New Zealand that Greenpeace has invited the general public to take civil disobedience action en masse. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/live"&gt;The day’s activities are being livestreamed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protest comes just days after the announcement that February 2016 was the hottest month in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	A group of organisations today expressed shock at the fact that a New Zealand energy company is introducing a tax of up to 26% on solar power and batteries from today, April 1.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;North Island energy provider Unison Energy will quietly introduce higher user lines and electricity charges on any new rooftop solar or battery system in the Hawkes Bay, Rotorua and Taupo area installed from 1 April. The tax will be extended to all solar power users on April 1, 2019.  It will increase customers’ bills by up to 26%, increasing them by between $128 and $258 a year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unison has held private, one-on-one meetings with solar energy companies, informing them of the move.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Solar customers have already suffered after the power companies slashed the rate they pay for solar energy fed back into the grid. People are saving money and energy by installing solar power, doing their bit for the climate,” said Kevin Hunter of local Hawkes Bay solar business Cellpower.  “Isn’t this what we should all be working towards to limit climate change and reduce electricity costs?”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Today might be April 1, but this is no joke,” said Executive Director of Greenpeace New Zealand, Russel Norman.  “That, in 2016, only months after the world agreed in Paris to reduce emissions to stop climate change, a New Zealand company is specifically taxing solar energy users is extraordinary – and wrong.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the US, the solar industry now employs more people than Facebook, Google and Amazon combined and is growing nearly 12 times faster than the overall economy. Here in New Zealand this clean technology industry is raidly growing, creating high value new jobs.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In virtually every other nation in the OECD, solar power is subsidised to encourage uptake and clean tech job creation, yet here in New Zealand our monopoly power companies are taxing the technology to kill the industry at birth,”  said Brendan Winitana, Chairman of the Sustainable Electricity Association New Zealand (SEANZ).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Solar power is now cheaper than retail power across our nation, which saves communities money and helps protect the environment.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;CEO of solarcity, Andrew Booth challenged the fairness of taxing an energy system like solar that has the same impact on reducing demand as other energy efficiency devices.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“What’s next?  If you take this to its logical conclusion, perhaps they should tax energy efficiency products– because by using a basket of simple technologies you can achieve the same demand reduction without impacting the winter peak.  Yet this new tax is only being levied on solar customers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Either reducing demand is an unfair avoidance of paying for the lines or it is not. The pricing strategies of the power companies are illogical and broken.  This is unfair, unjust and out of control.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Energy Analyst Molly Melhuish said:&lt;br&gt;“Hawkes Bay is one of the sunniest places in NZ, and this move by Unison to tax the sun is a clear infringement of civil liberties and the rights of all kiwis to harvest and use energy from the sun to reduce energy bills.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Hawkes Bay makes New Zealand’s most efficient wood burners, but air quality regulation is suppressing use of even approved wood burners. Wood and solar together could integrate with electricity supply to reduce costs year round.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Both Government and industry have vested interests in a growing electricity demand, because that gives the excuse for rising power prices. If only the industry would cooperate instead of competing with alternative fuels, New Zealand could enjoy 100% renewable – and affordable – household energy.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brendan Winitana added:&lt;br&gt;“It’s clear that Unison does not like the choices its customers are making.  Unison does not want to lose customers and revenue to solar companies.  But in New Zealand, we expect companies to respond to competition and innovation with better service, lower costs, and increased efficiency.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“What Unison has done instead is anti-competitive, unlawful and a clear abuse of monopoly power against ordinary kiwis who are trying to reduce power bills and help stop climate change. It’s time our energy retailers moved with the times, instead of penalising innovation.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The government should pull the plug on the controversial Ruataniwha irrigation scheme in Hawke’s Bay, as costs look set to soar towards the billion dollar mark, Greenpeace says today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A new report commissioned by Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, that examines the economics of the irrigation plans, has revealed that costs for the project have climbed by 50 per cent, and are set to add up to over $900million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But because money from Hawke’s Bay ratepayers and farmers will fall well short of the predicted $900million, the New Zealand government looks set to pour hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said: “It’s time for the government to pull the plug on this eyewateringly expensive plan. The Ruataniwha irrigation scheme makes no sense economically, or environmentally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This huge, costly irrigation scheme will industrialise our farms, probably bankrupt more New Zealand farmers and increase pollution into our rivers. And it’s only going to go ahead because the government is handing over taxpayers’ money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clean, green farming is much better for our finances, our farmers and our international reputation. It’s this that the government should be backing, not some failed industrial dairy model which is polluting our rivers and our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hundred year reliance on oil is at a turning point. The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico put the spotlight on the far reaching consequences that our addiction to oil is having on the natural world and on the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, oil is being used to power most of our vehicles, making us all dependent on it in some way - to get our food, to see our loved ones or to go on holiday. There are millions of cars, buses, trucks, ships and planes moving around our cities, our country, oceans and skies, connecting people and moving stuff around the world. But all of these vehicles need millions of gallons of oil to keep them going every day. And that’s taking a toll on the air we breathe, on our energy security, our economy, the environment and our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the giant oil fields that the industry hoped would last forever are starting to run dry. Faced with increasing restraints on access to the easy oil, companies are pushing in to areas previously considered too inaccessible, expensive or too risky to exploit. And this means going to greater and greater extremes to squeeze the last drops of oil from the earth - scraping the barrel in the tar sands of Canada, potentially violating the fragile ecosystems of the Arctic and now the pristine coastlines of New Zealand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            This map shows current and proposed areas of oil exploration, drilling, and coal mining, and the climate-changing potential of those coal deposits.
*The size of the oil deposits – and so the amount of potential CO2 emissions - within the new permit areas and block offers is not yet known.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these places are exploited, and the oil burnt, we will be on track for a six degree rise in global average temperatures. Two degrees is generally accepted by scientists and governments as the tipping point of dangerous climate change. Scientists say a rise of six degrees in average global temperatures would have cataclysmic and irreversible consequences for the planet and threaten our very survival. This is the path we are on right now. But if we transform our transport and energy systems this doesn’t have to be the pathway we follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, millions of dollars of our money is going into subsidising risky oil, and keeping us stuck in the oil age. Our governments are propping up the &lt;a href="http://www.crownminerals.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/about/Annual%20Report%20Web%20Version.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;oil companies&lt;/a&gt; with tax breaks and subsidies, and they’re allowing oil companies to exploit our natural world. In the long run, our addiction to oil will cost us far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do nothing, climate change will cost us around 20% of total gross domestic product (GDP) over the next half century. That's more than the cost of both world wars and the great depression put together. But if we act now to mitigate it, the cost would only be about one per cent of total economic growth. That's the same amount of money we spend on global advertising. Surely our survival is more important than billboards and TV adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	A year-long Greenpeace East Asia investigation into Taiwan’s distant water tuna fisheries has exposed Illegal shark finning, labour and human rights abuses, as well as Taiwan’s failure to adequately address issues such as murder and drug smuggling at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The findings released today in a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/Made-in-Taiwan/"&gt;Greenpeace East Asia report&lt;/a&gt; come as a yellow card warning from the European Commission is about to expire. Issued on 1 October 2015, Taiwan was given six months to clean up its fisheries or face economic sanction by the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These investigations paint a comprehensive picture of an industry in crisis,” says Yen Ning, Ocean Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. “Despite talking the talk, Taiwan’s Fisheries Agency appears incapable of monitoring the out-of-control tuna industry. Whether through lack of capacity or otherwise, our investigations reveal devastating impacts on marine life and people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, Taiwan owns the most tuna longline vessels, and Taiwan’s tuna take puts it in the top six Pacific fishing entities. Taiwanese companies, like seafood giant Fong Chun Formosa Fishery Company, Ltd. (FCF), exports directly to markets and supply some of the world’s largest seafood companies, including Thailand’s troubled Thai Union Group. Large amounts of Taiwanese caught tuna are exported to Thailand for processing, where serious labour and human rights violations have been recently exposed. This not only risks further contamination of Taiwanese products, but can also contaminate exports from Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fishing industries of both Taiwan and Thailand have been shown to have human rights problems,” says Yen Ning. “The murky tuna supply chains of companies like Thai Union have little transparency, which means seafood lovers everywhere may be eating tuna tainted by human exploitation and environmental crime, and they’d never know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace East Asia report also reveals the abusive treatment of foreign crew. Interviews with South East Asian crew members revealed delayed and withheld payments, along with horrendous working conditions, exploitation by recruiting agents, verbal and serious physical abuse, and death at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These human rights abuses seem to go hand-in-hand with environmental abuses. Fins are not allowed to be separated from shark carcasses under legislation Taiwan passed in 2012, but in a single three-month investigation in just one port in Taiwan, Greenpeace East Asia uncovered 16 illegal cases of shark finning. In contrast, an inquiry to Taiwan’s Fisheries Agency showed the same number of cases were recorded over the last 12 months, across the whole of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The yellow card should be a wake up call for Taiwan to reform its fisheries, eliminate human exploitation and environmental abuse, and develop sustainable management of precious marine resources,” says Yen Ning on behalf of Greenpeace East Asia, “This isn’t just about trade, it’s about Taiwan’s responsibility to treat workers fairly and to contribute to the ongoing sustainability of our oceans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s Fisheries Agency has proposed a new distant waters fisheries act, which Greenpeace East Asia says will be meaningless without enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the back of a report released this morning that shows the NZ Government has allowed businesses to buy fraudulent carbon credits from Russia and Ukraine, Greenpeace New Zealand has called for the linchpin of New Zealand’s climate policy to be thrown out.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ climate campaigner, Simon Boxer, says the report from the Morgan Foundation is proof that our Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), a policy which allows companies to offset their pollution by buying ‘carbon credits’ from other companies that pollute less, is “nothing but hot air”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a total bloody waste of time. The ETS was a policy that was purposefully made to sound boring and dense so people wouldn’t dig deeper into it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the reality is it doesn’t clean up pollution at all – in fact it actually allows businesses to make a profit from pollution. Under the National Government, this scheme is a scam. It’s a climate crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Foundation report, called Climate Cheats, outlines how the New Zealand Government has been complicit in the dealing of fraudulent carbon credits manufactured by organised crime in Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries use loopholes in international rules to create millions of false carbon credits that have no environmental benefit, and then sell them at bargain rates to the world market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union banned trade in these dodgy credits in 2013, but Boxer says New Zealand has continued to use them because they’re cheap, despite our Government knowing they’re fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, he says, is the fact that the use of these credits is one of the ways our Government plans to meet its climate targets for 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s another excuse for John Key to sit back, relax and do what he does best – which is absolutely nothing. If he was serious about the communities he represents, he would do real-life things like shut the coal burners at Huntly Power Station and promote renewable energy like wind and solar,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He would be backing green farming, rather than driving huge and costly irrigation schemes, which industrialise our farms, bankrupt New Zealand’s farmers, and allow our rivers and lakes to become so dirty they could make you sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, if he were a decent bloke, Key would not allow our environmental policy to be driven by a scam scheme that implicates us all in the heart of a global scandal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Foundation report comes mere weeks after the release of the explosive Panama Papers, which show New Zealand’s lax tax laws make it a pseudo tax-haven for foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

	Over the coming weeks, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza will remove destructive fishing gear including fish aggregating devices (FADs) belonging to Thai Union’s suppliers in the Indian Ocean. FADs attract tuna, along with a host of marine life including threatened sharks and juvenile tuna, which are then all scooped up in massive fishing nets.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the first operation of its kind, Greenpeace has already removed and disabled a FAD in Thai Union’s supply chain and will continue to remove more in an operation scheduled to last for many weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Union has been rocked by repeated links to human rights abuses in its supply chains and continues to use destructive fishing practices [1]. The use of FADs by companies like Thai Union is a serious driver of overfishing. Some tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean, such as Yellowfin, are on the brink of collapse due to overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company supplies many tuna and pet food brands, including Mars, owner of Whiskas cat food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thai Union also owns major brands around the world, including John West (UK and Netherlands), Chicken of the Sea (US), Petit Navire (France), Mareblu (Italy) and Sealect (Thailand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Kate Simcock said: “Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have already called on Thai Union to clean up its act. And in New Zealand, thousands of people have called on Whiskas’ parent company Mars to prove they aren’t selling pet food tainted by Thai Union’s reckless practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “These companies need to know they can’t hide behind paper policies and must take real action to protect oceans and workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Greenpeace’s campaign, launched in October 2015, has called on Thai Union to stop using FADs and ensure its entire global supply chain is free from human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;François Chartier, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace France, onboard the Esperanza, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tide is turning on companies who think they can keep plundering the oceans and turning a blind eye to exploitation in their supply chain. People want to know that the tuna they’re buying doesn’t come at the cost of the oceans and those who work on them. If Thai Union doesn’t want to stop this dirty tuna coming onto our shelves, then we are going to do it for them by taking action from sea to shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1] Recent investigations, including by the New York Times [&lt;a href="http://nyti.ms/1Ktzi9q"&gt;http://nyti.ms/1Ktzi9q&lt;/a&gt;] and Associated Press [&lt;a href="http://apne.ws/1Q4OJ7R"&gt;http://apne.ws/1Q4OJ7R&lt;/a&gt;], have found labour rights and human rights abuses in Thai Union’s supply chains. Despite taking some measures in response to these findings, Thai Union’s CEO Thiraphong Chansiri has said “We all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry’s supply chain is 100% clean”.

	Our future access to fresh water has been brought into question by a report, published this morning, which explores how New Zealand will be affected by climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/expert-advice/papers/yr2016/climate-change-implications-for-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/media/2016/04/Climate-Change-Implications-Report-cover-180x255.png" alt="Report download" width="180" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Increased demand for water from the agriculture industry will result in heightened competition for freshwater resources, says &lt;a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/expert-advice/papers/yr2016/climate-change-implications-for-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt; published by the Royal Society of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand agriculture campaigner, Gen Toop, says it’s one of the first times the impact of climate change on potential conflicts over water in New Zealand has been highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The report says we’re facing far more intense and regular droughts in many parts of the country. This has already seen the agriculture industry respond by scaling up industrial irrigation. But obviously our communities also need that freshwater to live on, so increasingly, we’re going to be competing with industrial dairying for access to it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most affected areas are going be rural Māori populations, many of which overlap with drought-prone zones, and all our communities that are dependent on non-reticulated systems for their freshwater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale irrigation schemes are not only jeopardising our access to freshwater, but they’re also failing our farmers, Toop says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These schemes cost millions of dollars and are  indebting New Zealand farmers. They’re only happening because the Government is handing over taxpayers’ money to subsidise them. Private investors aren’t touching them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN the three days since launch, over 8,500 people have signed a &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=49911"&gt;petition to stop Government funded industrial-scale irrigation schemes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Questions about the National Government’s fitness to lead on climate issues are being raised as Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett prepares to sign the Paris climate agreement on behalf of New Zealand tomorrow.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Bennett is currently in New York, where she will sign the document and formally commit New Zealand to lowering its pollution emissions by 11% of what they were in 1990, by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Greenpeace climate campaigner, Simon Boxer, says the signing is “nothing but a PR stunt” for the National Government, because it has no real plans to lower pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until Paula Bennett does something real, like enforce the shutdown of New Zealand’s last remaining coal burners at Huntly Power Station, then jetting off around the world to sign a piece of paper is largely meaningless,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, Huntly’s owner, Genesis Energy, announced it would be closing the coal part of the power plant by the end of 2018, saying New Zealand didn’t need it and it was too expensive to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three months ago it was revealed that several of New Zealand’s electricity providers, including Meridian Energy, had been meeting with Genesis Energy to find a way to keep the coal units running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxer says it's time to "get real".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure the National Government would say Huntly’s coal burners aren’t their problem. But we’re talking about a fight to keep the dirtiest fuel in the world alive in New Zealand in 2016 - the Government can’t wash their hands of this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The extent of National’s climate change action plan is to keep drilling, fracking and burning coal, whilst offsetting our pollution by trading shonky carbon credits bought from organised crime gangs in Russia. It’s a complete sham.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, a report from the Morgan Foundation revealed the NZ Government has been allowing businesses to buy fraudulent carbon credits from Russia and the Ukraine in order to ‘offset’ their emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries use loopholes in international rules to create millions of false carbon credits that have no environmental benefit, and then sell them at bargain rates to the world market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxer says it’s just another in a long line of examples of the National Government “ruining our international reputation” when it comes to the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If John Key was sincere about the promises he made in Paris, he would not allow further expansion of fossil fuels and he would invest in clean energy like wind and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But under the National Government, our emissions have actually increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Key has had almost eight years to cut pollution, and in that time he's failed to introduce a single piece of law to reduce climate pollution. It’s going to cost our economy billions in the future. Our communities are going to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand’s electricity watchdog is not fit for purpose and is working with big energy companies to destroy the future of rooftop solar power in New Zealand, according to Greenpeace NZ.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Electricity Authority (EA) ruled that a controversial move by Hawke’s Bay lines company, Unison, to charge its solar users an extra fee was not in breach of any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came on the heel of public uproar, which saw formal complaints being laid with the authority, and a petition asking it to protect solar collecting more than 30,000 signatures in just three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Simon Boxer, says the ruling now gives lines companies throughout the country the green light to follow Unison and put a tax on solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a blatant move by the EA to wash its hands of protecting and promoting renewable energy like solar so that it can continue to massage New Zealand’s electricity monopoly,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s no secret that the EA isn’t big a fan of solar. In the past it has even publicly advised New Zealanders not to rush into installing it. By giving the nod for Unison to penalise solar, the EA is effectively attempting to kill the uptake of solar in our near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve heard that many other lines companies are champing at the bit to issue similar charges, and the EA’s ruling means we’ll see these begin to roll out soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxer says these extra charges are effectively a  “tax” on solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the fee is a targeted and compulsory levy imposed on solar users in order to raise revenue for the lines company. As the deliverers of a public service, these companies are the functional equivalent of a governmental body, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government set up this monopolised business model of the electricity industry during the energy market reforms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was a deliberate policy that resulted in the private profits of the electricity sector taking precedent over national environmental and social interests. It’s a policy that the EA has been basically set up to serve.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the point of a watchdog should be to serve the interests of New Zealanders, Boxer says, especially on the back of the Paris Climate Conference, where we pledged to curb our dirty emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it can’t do its job, it should be disestablished, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We must bring this electricity watchdog to heel. All burning of dirty fuels like coal, oil and gas has to stop within a few decades if we want to avoid runaway climate change. Every renewable energy option that helps this must be rolled out, and solar is a crucial part of that,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	In the wake of today’s revelation by one the world’s foremost climate institutes that the planet has just experienced the hottest six months on record, the Executive Director of Greenpeace New Zealand is calling on the NZ Government to act urgently.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Dr. Russel Norman says the latest data released by US Government scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), yet again shows the planet is in a state of crisis, climate change is happening right now, and New Zealand “simply can’t afford” to ignore the problem any longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“For NOAA, one of the world’s top authorities on the climate, to come out with data showing that temperatures in January to June this year were the hottest we’ve ever recorded, is terrifying,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“We’re hearing about temperature records being broken month after month and our Government is still sitting on its hands, whistling. If we do not start acting immediately, we’re all going to be in big trouble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Key and his senior ministers claim to believe in the science of climate change, yet their pro-fossil fuel policies and total absence of climate action are consistent with actual climate denial.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Norman says an urgent plan to cut our emissions should have been put in place as soon as John Key returned from the Paris Climate Conference in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Instead Key came home saying he had no plans to cut back on the mining of oil, gas and coal here.  He says he has no opinion on our public power companies banding together to keep the Huntly coal fired power station burning, and he is silent while utilities like Unison are taxing solar to stop its uptake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“His Government has failed us when it comes to the climate – the latest carbon pollution inventory released earlier this year shows that Key’s  policies are steadily increasing our emissions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;At the Paris climate conference, the New Zealand Government was criticised for its inadequate offer to reduce its contribution to global climate change. It even picked up the very first ‘Fossil of the Day Award’, a booby prize given out by a global climate NGO coalition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The just-released NOAA data shows that as well as the Earth recording its hottest first half of any year dating back to when records began in 1880, June also marked the 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; consecutive warmest month for the planet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;According to the data, this is the longest-ever stretch of months in a row that a global temperature record has been set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Environment Minister Nick Smith is set to hold a meeting to discuss options for banning noxious microbeads from personal care products in New Zealand.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ says the Government must urgently follow the example of other countries like Canada, the USA and the Netherlands, and put a blanket ban on microbeads, a type of microplastic that can be found in products such as toothpastes, face washes, scrubs and shower gels.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Sarah Yates, says the harmful effects of the tiny plastic particles that are added to consumer goods for their exfoliating and aesthetic properties are well known, and Nick Smith’s meeting with the Ministry for the Environment must get the ball rolling on banning them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Evidence is mounting by the day that they’re bad news. Billions of microbeads are making their way through our sewerage systems and getting flushed out into our oceans, where they’re being eaten by marine animals,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They end up in the stomachs of aquatic life at all stages of the food chain, from plankton through to fish, dolphins and whales. Microbeads cause serious and painful health problems for these animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The latest studies are showing that some juvenile fish actually prefer to eat microbeads over their natural food source, which is leading to severe behavioural changes that threaten their survival.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most wastewater treatment technology is not capable of filtering out all microplastics, including&lt;br&gt;microbeads, because they are too small, Yates says. Once they’re released into the marine environment, it is impossible to clean them up and they persist in the environment for hundreds of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And although companies in New Zealand, including some supermarkets, are increasingly voluntarily getting rid of products with microbeads from their supply chain, Yates says now it’s time for the Government to step up too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A voluntary-level agreement just isn’t sufficient and has been proven not to work internationally. Eliminating microplastic pollution at the source is the only way forward. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As our Environment Minister, Nick Smith must move fast to enforce a national legislative ban where products containing microbeads are manufactured, used or sold.”&lt;/p&gt;

	A regional growth plan announced by the Government in the Hawke’s Bay today ignores the environmental fallout of the Ruataniwha Dam and the fact taxpayers will be burdened with the cost of building it, says Greenpeace.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ministers Joyce, Guy and Flavell were in Napier this morning launching the Hawke's Bay Regional Development Strategy and Action Plan, which mentions the dam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today’s report completely glosses over the environmental damage the dam would cause,” said Greenpeace campaigner Genevieve Toop, who was at the launch in Napier. “Ruataniwha is a golden ticket to intensive dairying in the Hawke’s Bay, which will pollute local rivers and increase climate emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Over two thirds of New Zealand’s rivers are now too polluted to swim in safely. We should be cleaning them up and protecting them, not building irrigation schemes that will make the problem worse.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The economics of Ruataniwha are also incredibly sketchy. Costs keep skyrocketing, key investors have walked away and now the Government plans to prop up the scheme with taxpayers’ money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This means ordinary New Zealanders will be forced to shoulder the costs and risks of a dam that does not stack up economically or environmentally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s understood  ACC will be brought in as a major investor in the dam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If ACC’s brought in, Hawke’s Bay residents will be forced to pay three times over for the polluting scheme – once through their taxes, again through their rates and again through ACC levies,” said Ms Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=49911" target="_blank"&gt;public petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for a ban on public subsidies for large-scale irrigation projects has attracted over 33,000 signatures (1) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The Ruataniwha irrigation scheme looks doomed, and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council should ditch it at tomorrow’s (Wednesday) council meeting, says Greenpeace today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The promoter of the controversial scheme, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company, is refusing to say if they have signed up enough farmers to make the scheme viable, despite the deadline passing last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a report commissioned by the council, examining the economics of the irrigation plans, revealed that costs have climbed by 50 per cent, and are set to soar to over $900million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said: “The Ruataniwha scheme looks doomed. It makes no sense economically or environmentally, and it’s time for the council to ditch it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This huge, costly irrigation plan will industrialise our farms, probably bankrupt more New Zealand farmers and increase pollution into our rivers. And, if it goes ahead, it will hoover up hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ and ratepayers’ money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ending this farcical scheme would be good news for our rivers, our economy and for farmers. And if the council finally does the right thing, they should be applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clean, green farming is much better for our finances, our farmers, our rivers and our international reputation. It’s this that the council and the government should be backing, not some failed industrial dairy model which is polluting our rivers and our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

	A major move by Landcorp to rid New Zealand farms of rainforest-destroying palm kernel has been welcomed by Greenpeace.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace has been campaigning for seven years for a phase-out of palm kernel expeller (PKE) on New Zealand farms, due to its role in both tropical rainforest destruction and industrial dairying” said Grant Rosoman from Greenpeace. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PKE is a by-product of the palm oil industry, which is the leading cause of rainforest destruction in Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Landcorp’s decision marks a significant turnaround for both the protection of Sth East Asia’s rainforests and for the way New Zealand farms. PKE has been a big part of the intensive dairy model that has failed our rivers, land, climate and farmers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s great to see a major player like Landcorp (the country’s largest farmer) turning its back on that model and moving back towards traditional New Zealand pasture-based farming. Next we want to see &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=44494"&gt;Fonterra follow suit&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand is currently the largest importer of PKE, using about a quarter of the world's supply each year as supplementary feed for livestock. On some farms, it’s believed to make up nearly 50 percent of cows’ diets.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It’s not a good look for Kiwi farms to be linked to the destruction of the world’s last remaining rainforests,” said Rosoman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;”As well as climate change impacts, the loss of rainforest habitat is pushing the orang-utan and Sumatran tiger towards extinction - not the sort of thing you want associated with New Zealand food products.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We hope that other farmer groups, and key processors such as Fonterra, will follow suit and phase out PKE from use on New Zealand farms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2009 a team from Greenpeace New Zealand travelled to Indonesia to document the destruction being done by the palm industry there. Later the same year Greenpeace stopped a shipment of palm kernel entering Tauranga, and painted a message on the side of another palm kernel ship in New Plymouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In September 2010, Greenpeace returned to Indonesia to gather evidence of how the palm industry was opening up new frontiers of destruction. This evidence was later delivered directly to Fonterra's headquarters in Auckland, and to politicians in Wellington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2010 Greenpeace released a spoof Fonterra milk TV ad that went viral gaining over 250,000 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvLsAMsOJM" target="_blank"&gt;views on youtube&lt;/a&gt; The ad connected Fonterra milk with the death of orangutan in Indonesian rainforests cleared for palm plantations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra’s announcement that it will clean up its use of palm kernel expeller (PKE) is a good first step, but the dairy giant must move towards a full phase out as soon as possible, says Greenpeace.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Fonterra has this morning committed to using only responsible palm oil products throughout its global supply chains. This follows a move by Landcorp earlier in the week to completely phase out its use of PKE.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;PKE is a by-product of the palm oil industry, which is the leading cause of rainforest destruction in Indonesia. Greenpeace has been campaigning for seven years to stop its use in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Forests Advisor Grant Rosoman: “New Zealanders in their tens of thousands have urged Fonterra to drop PKE. People don't want to be consuming products linked to the destruction of the world’s last remaining rainforests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Fonterra has bowed to public pressure and taken an important first step. This is a win for the rainforests and a win for better dairying in New Zealand, because PKE's been a big part of the intensive dairy model that has failed our rivers, land, climate and farmers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We now look forward to Fonterra moving towards a full phase out,” said Mr Rosoman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Zealand is currently the largest importer of PKE, using about a quarter of the world's supply each year as supplementary feed for livestock. On some farms, it’s believed to make up nearly 50 percent of cows’ diets.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fonterra’s new policy, unveiled today, involves using only responsible palm oil products on its farms (i.e. PKE and other palm oil products from suppliers that are not clearing rainforest, developing peatlands or exploiting local communities and workers).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Fonterra’s guidance to farmers to immediately reduce PKE use and re-focus on pasture-based dairying is a significant move towards ecological farming, which is exactly where New Zealand should be,” said Rosoman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We encourage New Zealand farmers and other suppliers or consumers of PKE in this country to follow Landcorp and Fonterra’s lead and ensure they’re now only using responsible PKE, while moving to stopping its use completely as soon as possible,” said Rosoman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In August 2009 a team from Greenpeace New Zealand went undercover in Indonesia to document rainforest destruction for palm. Later the same year Greenpeace stopped a shipment of palm kernel entering Tauranga Port, and later targeted a palm kernel ship in New Plymouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In September 2010, Greenpeace returned to Indonesia to gather evidence of how the palm industry was opening up new frontiers of destruction, and  This evidence was linked to Fonterra and delivered directly to Fonterra's headquarters in Auckland, and to politicians in Wellington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A summary of the campaign can be &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/blog/farming-the-rainforests-and-you/blog/57245/"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2010 Greenpeace released a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvLsAMsOJM"&gt;spoof Fonterra milk TV ad&lt;/a&gt;.

	The New Zealand Government must act to protect our dolphins after a new scientific report to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) says that twenty times more New Zealand dolphins are killed by the NZ fishing industry than the public is being told about. In addition the IWC has criticized the New Zealand Government for failing to act to protect critically endangered Maui dolphins.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Once again the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) and other government agencies have been found to be systematically underreporting the damage that the NZ fishing industry is doing to our oceans,” says Russel Norman, executive director of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent report by scientists from the University of Otago Zoology Department and Marine Science Department paints a damning picture of dolphin by-catch and under-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's no wonder some of our dolphins are threatened with extinction, when the Government responsible for looking after them is dramatically underreporting deaths to the International Whaling Commission,” says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report found that for the years 2000 to 2006 there were 48 reported deaths of NZ dolphins in nets, but that the real number was up to 1050. The evidence suggests the underreporting of dolphin catch is even greater than the fisheries underreporting in New Zealand identified in the recent University of British Columbia catch reconstruction report.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How many damning scientific reports do we need to see before the government agency actually does something,” asks Norman. “Protecting New Zealand dolphins from extinction is part of what it means to love this country. We market this country on swimming with dolphins. A dolphin death cover up of this scale could cause massive damage to our international reputation, and to New Zealand as a tourist destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Genesis Energy has been named as one of a dozen New Zealand companies that bought large numbers of fraudulent carbon credits from Russia and the Ukraine, it has been revealed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The information, released yesterday by the Morgan Foundation, is the second part of the report Climate Cheats, which the Foundation released in April. This outlined how the New Zealand Government had been complicit in the dealing of fraudulent carbon credits manufactured by organised crime groups in Russia and Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand climate spokesperson, Kate Simcock, says she was “highly disturbed” to see Genesis Energy being named as one of a dozen New Zealand businesses using the credits between 2013-2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is one of New Zealand’s largest electricity companies caught buying dodgy carbon credits, no doubt at rock-bottom prices, in order to appear to meet climate obligations,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Genesis Energy would have known that they were buying dirt cheap and very questionable credits. The EU had banned these credits and other companies including Mobil, were refusing to buy them. That ought to have raised serious concerns for Genesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What’s more, the report says there have been allegations that electricity suppliers didn’t drop their prices as a result of the cheap buy. If this is true, it means they used the New Zealand public to profit from the use of these fraudulent credits.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact Energy was the other electricity company named in The Dozen Dirty Businesses report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says these revelations make it clear that electricity companies like Genesis Energy, which is 51% Government-owned, have no interest in looking after New Zealanders or the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April, the company announced it would be keeping its Huntly Power Station’s coal burners on for at least another four years, despite previously promising to turn them off by 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This followed several power companies, including Meridian Energy, holding closed-door discussions in an attempt to subvert the decision to shut the burners down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Over the past year we’ve seen major players in the electricity industry conspire to keep dirty fuels burning with zero regard for the climate crisis facing our communities, or the consumers that will have to pay higher costs,” Simcock says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shutting down Huntly Power Station would have been real action when it comes to our climate, but instead Genesis turned a blind eye and bought shonky carbon credits in order to make profit at our expense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s time for a major shake-up of the electricity market, and we think it will come in the form of disillusioned Kiwis increasingly turning to renewable energy like solar, which they can own and control themselves.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Morgan Foundation reports show Russia and the Ukraine have been using loopholes in international rules to create millions of false carbon credits that have no environmental benefit, and then sell them at bargain rates to the world market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says the European Union banned trade in these credits in 2013, but New Zealand has continued to use them because they’re cheap, despite our Government almost certainly knowing they’re fraudulent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The remaining 11 companies named in The Dozen Dirty Businesses report are: BP Energy Asia, New Zealand Forest Leasing Limited, Z Energy Limited, Wairekei Pastoral Limited, New Zealand Steel Limited, Matariki Forests, Contact Energy Limited, Chevron New Zealand, Fonterra Limited, Ngai Tahu Forests Estates Limited, and China Forestry Group of New Zealand Limited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Morgan Foundation gave all companies a right to respond, and responses by BP, Contact Energy and Z Energy appeared in the report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate Cheats I &lt;a href="http://morganfoundation.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ClimateCheat_Report9.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate Cheats II: The Dozen Dirty Businesses &lt;a href="http://cdn.morganfoundation.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ClimateCheat2_Report_V8.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The US Government’s decision to send a warship to New Zealand is a huge victory for people power, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Thirty years ago New Zealanders drew a line in the sand. We said 'we are nuclear free', and if a country wants to send a warship here it must be free of nuclear weapons and not nuclear powered,” says Dr Russel Norman, Executive Director of Greenpeace NZ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The US balked at this, but for 33 years we’ve stood our ground. Now they’re sending a ship here - on our terms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealanders should be immensely proud. We stood up to the mightiest military power on earth, not to mention a traditional ally. And we won.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Regardless of what you think of the US navy, or other navies, this is an historic victory for people power."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Norman said an anti-nuclear position was as relevant as ever, in a world still overshadowed by the potential for nuclear war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning for a nuclear free world for over 30 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand’s ratification of the Paris Agreement won’t be worth the paper it’s written on unless the Government abandons its “climate denialist” policies, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Government has announced it will ratify the Paris agreement by the end of the year. Under the agreement New Zealand has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What part of new roads, oil and gas exploration, solar taxes and intensive dairying will help us reach the Paris target?” said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Kate Simcock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No Government serious about honouring the Agreement introduces policies like the National Party’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re serious about tackling climate change, you close the Huntly coal fired power station, you incentivise not penalise renewables, and you don’t publicly fund giant irrigation schemes that will drive more intensive dairy farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen no sign from this Government that it’s willing to take the climate threat seriously or pull its weight globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory (released in May) showed New Zealand's emissions are at their highest since 1990 and have increased 23% in 24 years. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A large part of New Zealand’s emissions profile can be put down to the pro-fossil fuels, pro-pollution policies favoured by this Government,” said Ms Simcock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John Key’s government is failing on climate change. This has to change if we’re to meet our global obligations and our obligation to future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

	The revelation that Shell has advised its investment bank to offload its $1 billion New Zealand portfolio is another big nail in the coffin of the Government’s petroleum agenda, according to Greenpeace New Zealand.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On Friday,  Australian media reported that the oil giant had called on JP Morgan to sell its New Zealand portfolio, which includes oil exploration and production assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows on from the oil giant’s announcement last December that it was placing its New Zealand assets under a review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate campaigner Steve Abel said Shell’s imminent withdrawal from New Zealand shows the Government’s oil drilling programme is now “in its death throes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand’s biggest oil company is just the latest to abandon oil and gas exploration here, following on from the exits of Petrobras and ExxonMobil,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To lose Shell after more than 100 years in New Zealand is a huge blow to the industry and to the Government’s fervent investment of public money in oil drilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reports emerged of Shell’s plans to offload its New Zealand portfolio, the company has tried to scuttle the news, claiming it’s still exploring its options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abel doesn’t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to be a geotechnical scientist to read the signs here - Shell wants out of New Zealand,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prime Minister John Key’s oil program is in tatters. There has been no new oil found in eight concerted years of exploration, and now the biggest rat is fleeing the sinking tanker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government urgently needs to quit oil and put in place a clean energy strategy that will power our society and create thousands of jobs in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No new deep sea oil permits were allocated in the last block offer announcement in December 2015, and of the almost 430,000 square kilometres on offer, there were only successful bids on 12,000 of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was thought that the lack of deep sea permits was because no oil companies showed interest in sticking around for the year to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell didn’t submit any bids in that process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Environmental groups like Greenpeace have been fighting Shell’s oil agenda on home turf and abroad for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was hailed a major victory when Shell pulled its oil drilling plans in the Arctic last year, after massive public pressure that included a global petition with more than seven million signatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel said Prime Minister Key is pushing climate change denialist policies by continuing to insist that New Zealand must look for the very oil that scientists say we can’t burn if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Upon his return from the Paris Climate Conference in January, the Prime Minister stated he had no intention of scaling back any search for fossil fuels,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But even the oil companies are seeing the writing on the wall in terms of New Zealand’s petroleum prospects.  At the moment it looks like Key will be the last man on the sinking ship, even after the oil companies have abandoned their posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s good news for our oceans coastlines and climate. The people of Otago, Southland and the Chathams, where two of Shell’s exploration permits are, can now breath a sigh of relief because it seems very unlikely anyone will be doing risky deep sea drilling down there for a long time - if ever.”  &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is demanding an end to public subsidies for large-scale irrigation projects, after a report revealed the Government has thrown millions of dollar at a proposed irrigation project in the Wairarapa that doesn’t stack up financially.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An economic review of the Wairarapa application for irrigation funding was prepared by Rōpere Consulting for Fish and Game, &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uinc9rkivniq4bv/Ropere%20Consulting%20Report%20.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"&gt;and released today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It finds serious fault with both the credibility of the economic analysis of the project, and the way MPI assessed the scheme’s viability.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“MPI is rubber stamping these Think-Big irrigation projects despite shaky economics. It’s literally throwing taxpayers’ money away,” said Greenpeace Agriculture spokesperson Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Wairarapa dams project is one of several industrial irrigation schemes planned around the country. It has so far received a total of $2.5m from Government, and over $3m from the Wellington’s regional and district councils.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;MPI approved the project promoters’ application for Stage 2 (Feasibility) funding and granted it $804,000. It did so on the basis the scheme would usher in more intensive dairy farming, at a farm gate milk price of $7.07 per kilogram of milk solids. This assumption was made in 2014. As the report concludes: “this is a completely unrealistic basis for decision-making in 2016”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The predicted price per kilo of milk solids for 2016-17 is sitting at around $4.75.  The report says it’s likely recent record low milk prices are not cyclical, but a long term structural change in international prices.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The report concludes that at current and prospective farm gate milk prices irrigated dairying is not viable in the Wairarapa - even if the water is free - meaning the project is unviable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Not only will these proposed irrigation schemes further deplete water quality in New Zealand by driving more industrial agriculture, but they don’t even stack up financially. It’s the same in Hawke’s Bay with the Ruataniwha,” said Ms Toop.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Government needs to give up its dream for more industrial dairying at any cost, stop taxpayer subsidies for big irrigation,  and instead support ecological farming practices that look after our land and water.” said Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Most New Zealanders would be horrified to know their tax money is being spent on flawed schemes that will drive more water pollution.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 50,000 people have &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=49911" target="_blank"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; demanding an end to Government subsidies  for big irrigation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In an extraordinary move, the Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment company has said it’s taking the first step in the process of acquiring land needed for the Ruataniwha Dam under the Public Works Act. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The company also today applied for leave to appeal a Court of Appeal decision that found a DOC land swap for the dam was illegal.(1) It intends to pursue both avenues in parallel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Not content with appealing a major court decision using public money, HBRIC also looks set to run roughshod over the law and public opinion and try to forcibly remove this piece of public conservation land,” said Greenpeace Sustainable Agriculture campaigner Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is a hugely controversial move. If HBRIC continues down this path there’s going to be a massive public outcry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Apart from anything else, they should not be considering removing public land for a private irrigation scheme that will only benefit 192 landowners.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim Scotland of HBRIC told a Hawke’s Bay Regional Council meeting today that HBRIC were going ahead with an application under the Public Works Act “for the whole of the reservoir and dam footprint area...” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This shows an extraordinary level of arrogance and presumption,” said Genevieve Toop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said the Crown would ultimately have to sign off the land acquisition. “The good news is, I  cannot see how John Key would dare step into this fight -  not with the controversy surrounding the dam and not with the state of water quality in Hawke’s Bay.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling for the dam to be scrapped, because it will mean more industrial dairy farming and further pollution of local waterways in Hawke’s Bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) New Zealand Herald: &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503462&amp;amp;objectid=11718486"&gt;Fight over controversial land swap to continue in Supreme Court&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is erecting anti-Ruataniwha billboards around Hawke’s Bay this morning, two weeks out from the close of voting in regional council elections.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The signs feature a large cow with a tap attached to its behind, along with the text: “Dam Wrong, stop Ruataniwha” (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace sustainable agriculture campaigner Genevieve Toop, who’s in Hawke’s Bay, said: “The new council will be an important deciding factor in whether the dam goes ahead, and water will be front of mind for many voters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Local waterways in Hawke’s Bay are already polluted and under pressure. The Ruataniwha dam will compound these problems by driving more intensive dairy farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After what’s happened in Havelock North, the new council needs to put people’s health before more industrial dairying and drop the dam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If Hawke’s Bay residents have concerns about the dam, they should make sure they vote, and make sure they know where each candidate stands on the scheme.”&lt;/p&gt;

	The Heron report provides further evidence that the fisheries section of the Ministry of Primary Industry has been captured by the very industry it was supposed to be regulating.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;'If New Zealanders are wondering why it is so hard to catch a fish these days, this report offers a simple cause, MPI is helping the fishing industry to cover up illegal systematic dumping of fish,' said Dr. Russel Norman, Executive Director of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heron Report examines the failure of MPI to prosecute illegal systemic fish dumping in spite of video evidence of such dumping, and reveals that senior management at MPI blocked any prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While damning in what it does reveal, MPI’s repeated refusal to waive legal privilege, means, far from being an open and transparent explanation, the New Zealand public is once again not being told the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘You have to ask, what MPI are hiding from us. Nothing short of a dramatic shakeup of the MPI fisheries can restore public confidence in the management of fisheries in New Zealand,’ says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, MPI Director-General Martyn Dunne’s answer to ongoing and systemic fish dumping by the fishing industry, has been to award the industry the contract to electronically monitor itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Unsurprisingly, MPI can't see any problem with the fishing industry owning the company that video monitors the fishing industry,’ says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘All future video monitoring tenders should include a provision that the entity performing the video monitoring is completely independent of the fishing industry,' says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With public faith in the fishing industry and the Ministry of Primary Industries at an all time low, Greenpeace is calling for a commission of inquiry into fisheries regulation and the Quota Management System which is currently driving the fish dumping. The review must be run by people completely independent of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The report shows that MPI is working for the fishing industry, not for the people of New Zealand. MPI has been caught by the fishing industry - hook line and sinker.’&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has welcomed the preliminary results of the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council election, saying the new council's top priority must be to ditch the Ruataniwha dam.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“The result shows Hawke’s Bay residents have had enough of contaminated waterways and don’t want more industrial dairy farming,” said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;“We look forward to the new council swiftly exercising its power to stop the dam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning to stop the dam on the basis it will mean 9,000 additional hectares of industrial dairy farming in the Bay and compound local water quality problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;“The dam was the key issue election issue in Hawke’s Bay. The people have spoken,” said Mike Smith. “They have given this council a mandate to scrap the dam.  Politicians in Wellington would do well to take note.” &lt;/p&gt;

	Labour should be working to support New Zealand’s commitment to create one of the world's biggest marine sanctuaries and protect sea-life for generations to come, said representatives of leading environmental groups today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Labour Party has championed  the creation of a Kermadec/Rangitāhua Ocean Sanctuary at the last two elections. They now seem to be saying that their own policy is a breach of fisheries rights and the fisheries settlement,” said &lt;a href="http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/"&gt;Forest &amp;amp; Bird&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Kevin Hackwell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are concerned that Labour seems to be backing away from its commitment to create a Kermadec/Rangitāhua Ocean Sanctuary because it sees a political opportunity to attack the government,” said Mr Hackwell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eds.org.nz/"&gt;EDS&lt;/a&gt; Chairman, Gary Taylor added “The law is very clear that along with the ability to exclusively manage fisheries within our economic zone, the government has a right and an international obligation to create marine protected areas”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Looking after our oceans is not a breach of fishing rights,” said Mr Taylor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; Executive Director Russel Norman said “Fishing quota, held by both Māori and Pakeha, has always been subject to regulation to look after the health of the oceans”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Labour Party now seems to be agreeing with the fishing industry that no-take marine reserves are a breach of fisheries rights and compensation needs to be given even when no fishing is taking place. This could set a precedent which makes it extremely difficult to set up a network of marine protected areas, that our oceans so badly need,” said Dr Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wwf.org.nz/"&gt;WWF-New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Senior Campaigner, Alex Smith said “There have been legitimate treaty issues raised around the government process for developing the Kermadec/Rangitāhua Ocean Sanctuary. As a country we need to learn from these and set up a framework for developing marine protection that involves iwi in decision making at every step”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We support ongoing dialogue, but we shouldn’t let TOKM and the wider fishing industry derail marine protection for the Kermadecs/Rangitāhua,” added Alex Smith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Labour is currently buying into a dangerous fishing industry agenda, hook, line and sinker,” said Alex Smith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gary Taylor added “TOKM has the right to go to court to have their arguments tested. But we believe its case is extremely weak, and EDS has applied to join proceedings in the High Court”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Taylor added “the Sanctuary is backed by solid science and by 89% of New Zealanders. We urge the Labour Party to honour its election commitments and play a constructive role in finding a way through”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environmental NGOs – Forest &amp;amp; Bird, Greenpeace, WWF-New Zealand, Pew, and &lt;a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/places/new-zealand"&gt;EDS&lt;/a&gt; – stand in support of the Kermadec/Rangitāhua Ocean Sanctuary and hope a way can be found through the current issues so that all New Zealanders can together be proud to establish one of the biggest ocean sanctuaries in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Labour’s position is available &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/201816797/kermadec-sanctuary-issue-mishandled-by-government-little"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has uplifted the site office of the proposed Ruataniwha Dam and delivered it to the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council offices in Napier.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Early this morning, a Greenpeace team removed the site office at Tikokino using a hiab truck, depositing it outside the front doors of the HBRC building, 100 kilometres away in Napier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It says the council needs to scrap plans for the controversial dam in order to protect local waterways, and it’s helping the council do so by returning the site office to sender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After what’s happened in Havelock North, the council needs to put people’s health before more industrial dairying and drop the Ruataniwha Dam,” Greenpeace Agriculture Campaigner Genevieve Toop said from Napier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Local waterways in Hawke’s Bay are already polluted and under pressure. The dam will compound these problems by driving more intensive dairy farming.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The return-to-sender comes just days out from voting papers landing in people’s letterboxes for the upcoming local elections. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The new council will be an important deciding factor in whether the dam goes ahead,” said Ms Toop. “Water quality is expected to be front of mind for many voters.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is not alone in calling on the regional council to drop the dam. In the last few weeks, over 70,000 emails have been sent to the councillors asking them to halt the scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“People are putting two and two together, and realising that big irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha increase the risk to New Zealand’s waterways,” said Ms Toop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The council has wasted millions of ratepayer dollars and six years on this dam and they’ve got nothing to show for it apart from mounting public opposition.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They need to stop using public money to prop up industrial dairying and instead support ecological farming that looks after our land, people and water.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling for the Ruataniwha dam project in Hawke’s Bay to be scrapped in light of the latest lead on the gastro outbreak.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"River pollution from the Tukituki has been identified as a highly possible cause of the outbreak - the worst of its kind in our history,” said Greenpeace Agriculture spokesperson Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Ruataniwha irrigation dam will compound the pollution problem by driving intensive dairy farming in the Tukituki catchment. If ever there was a time to pull the plug on this scheme it’s now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A former GNS Science hydrogeologist says contaminated water from the Tukituki River could have infected the Havelock North water supply. Cows,sheep or deer are thought to be to blame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace has been saying for some time that the Ruataniwha Dam will put local water sources at risk, because it will enable more dairy cows on the Ruataniwha Plains,” said Ms Toop. “What’s happened in the last week and a half is a massive wake-up call. The local council needs to consign the dam plan to the scrap heap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Human health must come before more industrial dairying," said Ms Toop. "The health of our waterways must come before industrial dairying.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week public health professor &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/201812296/investigations-underway-over-hawke's-bay-campylobacter-crisis" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Baker told Radio NZ&lt;/a&gt; that New Zealand’s drinking water is “under huge pressure from…intensification of dairying, which is obviously contaminating surface water a lot more.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Despite the risks, the Government is throwing over half a billion taxpayer dollars at big irrigation schemes, not just in Hawke’s Bay but across the country, and local councils are pouring in millions of dollars of ratepayers’ money. That money should instead be going into better, more ecological farming practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should be cleaning up and protecting our rivers and water supplies, not building giant irrigation schemes that will make the problem worse,” said Ms Toop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We can’t risk a repeat of what we’re seeing in Hawke’s Bay.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealanders in their thousands are calling on the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council (HBRC) to scrap the Ruataniwha Dam, in the wake of the gastro outbreak.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The waterborne illness that’s gripped Havelock North over the last two weeks has sparked nationwide concern over industrial agriculture and its impact on New Zealand’s waterways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now people from around the country are demanding HBRC ditch its dam plan, in order to prevent more pressure on waterways. Nearly &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=54950" target="_blank"&gt;4,000 people so far have emailed&lt;/a&gt; regional councillors, urging them not to allow the dam to proceed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“People are putting two and two together, and realising that big irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha increase the risk of Havelock North-type outbreaks, because one of the main purposes of the schemes is to enable more industrial dairying," said Greenpeace Agriculture Spokesperson Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealanders also recognise that if Ruataniwha gets the go ahead, it will be seen as a green light for other big irrigation schemes around the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Irrigation schemes enable more industrial dairy farming, and more industrial dairy farming contaminates our waterways. We can't have a repeat of what's happened in the last two weeks in Havelock North. People’s health and the health of our rivers must come before industrial dairying.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the risks of big irrigation, the Government is throwing over half a billion taxpayer dollars at it, not just in the Hawke’s Bay but across the country, and local councils are pouring in millions of dollars of ratepayers’ money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That public money should instead be going into better, more ecological farming practices,” said Ms Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should be cleaning up and protecting our rivers and water supplies, not building giant irrigation schemes that will further pollute them.”&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand musician Tiki Taane has just taken 45,000 paper suns to New Zealand’s electricity watchdog, each with the name of someone who signed a petition demanding the authority support solar energy and prohibit electricity providers from penalising solar users.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Taane was showered in the tens of thousands of suns in the reception of the Electricity Authority in Wellington, while serenading the Authority with his song, Shine Your Love, which he wrote especially for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taane’s song and the unique delivery of the Greenpeace New Zealand petition will also be made into a music video to be released on the Greenpeace YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the Electricity Authority ruled that a decision by Hawke’s Bay lines company, Unison, to charge its solar customers extra, was not in breach of any rules, prompting widespread outrage and concern that other lines companies will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace called the targeted and compulsory levy a “solar tax” designed to discourage solar adoption, and launched a petition, which received almost 45,000 signatures in just over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musician Taane was one of the first to put his name to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should be celebrating the fact that so many Kiwis are behind solar. Solar is a vital part of the solution to dangerous climate change. Sunshine is free, it’s clean and it’s everywhere,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I installed solar on my home because I wanted to do my bit for the planet and my family. It’s been a really rewarding process and feels empowering to be able to live sustainably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner, Kate Simcock, says solar in New Zealand is being threatened by big energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Solar power is one the fastest growing energy sources in the world. It gives families and communities the power to manage their own electricity, it displaces dirty fuels like coal, and it can cut monthly power bills substantially,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the watchdog of New Zealand’s power, the Electricity Authority must step up to the plate and protect people’s freedom of choice to use clean energy like solar. This includes stopping power providers from penalising solar users by introducing ridiculous policies like a tax on sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government needs to get real about our changing climate. We simply can’t keep hoping for the best while continuing to drill, frack and burn coal.  We need tangible solutions, including urgently shutting down Huntly Power Station and supporting rapid uptake of clean energy like solar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simcock says Greenpeace plans to do “another cheeky” celebration when the petition hits 100,000 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="box-holder"&gt;
&lt;div class="box"&gt;
&lt;div class="holder"&gt;
&lt;div class="frame"&gt;
&lt;div class="box-content"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food and Farming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;These things are fundamental to who we are, what we do and how New Zealand makes its way in the world. But there are big problems with the way we’re currently farming. The industrial  farming model prevalent in New Zealand is damaging our land, rivers, climate and farmers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our farming made a name for itself based on two simple five-letter words – clean and green - and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;our products set us apart in shopping trolleys and baskets across the globe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;But somewhere along the way we lost our bearings.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Family farms got snapped up and subsumed into industrial-scale dairying operations. We began to clear-fell forests to make way for industrial dairy farms, pile fertilizers onto the land; squeeze too many cows onto every hectare, and feed them supplementary feed from destroyed Indonesian rainforests. All this to sell faceless milk powder on volatile global commodity markets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This high input, high output model has cost our rivers (two thirds are already at times too polluted to swim in safely , our climate (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;agriculture emissions make up half New Zealand’s emissions and continue to rise) and our farmers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;New Zealand dairy farmers are collectively burdened with&lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/299110/banks-will-survive-dairy-downturn-rb"&gt; &lt;span class="s3"&gt;$38 billion worth of debt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, putting unimaginable pressure on individuals, families and communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;And things are set to get worse, with large-scale irrigation schemes planned across the country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;People don’t necessarily make the link between irrigation and big dairy - irrigation’s just storing and moving water around, right?   Wrong. In New Zealand, irrigation enables industrial farming where it wouldn’t otherwise occur. It’s a golden ticket to more big dairy farms, which is the last thing our climate and rivers need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The industrial farming model is a failed experiment. Change is needed if New Zealand farming and farmers are to prosper again. &lt;strong&gt;We need to make New Zealand farming something we can be proud of again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Genesis Energy has been granted consents to replace Huntly Power Station’s coal-fired Rankine units at any time it likes for the next 20 years. 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;According to subscription-only industry publication &lt;em&gt;Energy News&lt;/em&gt;, the Waikato Regional Council has granted Genesis, Huntly’s owner, permission to install a range of gas turbines through until the end of 2037.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand senior campaign advisor, Steve Abel, says the majority public-owned power giant is “burning our future with gas”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This is a Government-owned power company that is spending millions to expand the use of the dirty fuels we must stop burning if we’re going to avoid climate catastrophe,” he says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Genesis and their buddies in the industry tell a lie that gas and coal are necessary for grid security and will mostly be used in emergencies. In reality, Genesis burns fossil fuels at Huntly almost every day to justify the huge investment in its infrastructure. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The big power companies are in cahoots to lock us into dependency on expensive, dirty power, when there are other great options to totally clean up our electricity and also give the public cheaper power.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The just-granted consents will allow Genesis to install open-cycle gas turbines at Huntly up to a total capacity of 400 MW.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The move is the latest in a line of controversial decisions made by the power company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Two years ago, it promised to shut Huntly’s two remaining coal burners by 2018. However, following a series of closed-door meetings with fellow power companies, Meridian Energy and Contact Energy, Genesis reneged on that promise in April and announced the burners would actually be kept running until at least 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;And in August, new CEO Marc England stated that a third coal-burning unit, which had been previously mothballed, could be returned to service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;At the time, the company indicated that it would also look at buying more coal this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This betrays England as a CEO intent on burning coal and gas for years to come,” Abel says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“There is zero need for new gas and coal, but there is an urgent need to eliminate the dirty fuels that are driving the planet towards human and ecological extinction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“There is a lack of industry and political leadership in this country on electricity - it’s basically climate denial. There should be a ban on any new thermal consents in New Zealand, as well as a phase out of existing coal and gas burning for electricity and dehydration of milk powder.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand taxpayers are again being forced to prop up the Hurunui irrigation dams and will get dirty rivers and increasing rural debt in return, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It was responding to an announcement by the Government that it will be subsiding the Hurunui irrigation scheme in North Canterbury by $3.4 million.  This comes on top of over a million of taxpayer dollars that have already been given to the scheme.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Hurunui irrigation dams will take water from iconic local rivers to drive more industrial dairying and therefore more water pollution and more debt in our rural communities“ said Greenpeace Sustainable Agriculture campaigner Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The assessment of environmental effects of the scheme assumed that the entire irrigated area would be used for dairying and the company's own economic report confirmed that dairy will be the dominant land use. (1) (2)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Government has set aside $480 million of taxpayer dollars for irrigation schemes like the Hurunui dams.  Earlier this year MPI came under fire for playing fast and loose with taxpayer money when it approved a funding application by Wairarapa dams. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Fish &amp;amp; Game-commissioned report found the application to be highly misleading and based on bad information including an inflated dairy payout.(3)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Industrial dairying is failing our rivers and it’s failing dairy farmers whose debt has tripled in the last 13 years.  It is irresponsible for the Government to be pushing and subsidising this broken model.” said Toop&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;She said the existing Opuha dam, also in the Canterbury region, has proven to be ineffective at dealing with drought.  It dried up in 2015, leaving farmers who had converted and intensified off the back of it without any water. (4)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large-scale irrigation was not the answer to drought, said Toop. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Trying to push water hungry industrial dairy farms into low rainfall regions ultimately decreases the resiliency of our farming sector.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Instead of throwing money at these think big schemes the Government should instead be supporting farmers to transition from industrial dairying to ecological farming which looks after our land, our water and our rural communities.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=49911" target="_blank"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an end to public subsidies for large-scale irrigation has attracted over 60,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

	Texan oil giant Anadarko is the latest to join the  growing list of companies to scale back or completely quit their search for oil in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Subscription-only industry publication, &lt;em&gt;Energy News&lt;/em&gt;, has reported that Anadarko will surrender two major permits that allow it to search for oil in Pegasus Basin over an area of 7,085 square-kilometres off the Kaikoura and Wellington Coasts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Anadarko has been the focus of years of protest by thousands of New Zealanders, Greenpeace, anti-oil groups and iwi.  These protests sparked the controversial “Anadarko Amendment” in 2013, specifically designed to stop protest at sea against oil ships.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Anadarko is the only company to actually do exploratory drilling in the deep sea since the Key Government’s oil program began, and it’s yet to find anything. Having quit its Deepwater Taranaki permit and now the two Pegasus permits, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anadarko retains partial interest in two remaining permits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;PEP 55377 in the New Caledonia basin and PEP 38264 in the Canterbury Basin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The move comes hot on the heels of Norwegian petroleum company, Statoil, announcing the withdrawal of 90% of its New Zealand assets. The sudden move follows years of pressure and protest from Greenpeace and Northern iwi. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Their partial withdrawal came after the complete exit in previous years of two other drillers from New Zealand – Petrobras and ExxonMobil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Australian media has also reported that New Zealand’s biggest oil company, Shell, is preparing to sell its entire portfolio here, which includes oil exploration and production assets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;It was hailed a major international victory when Shell pulled its oil drilling plans in the Arctic last year, after massive public pressure that included a global petition with more than seven million signatures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Steve Abel said Anadarko’s Pegasus Basin withdrawal is just another example that the Government’s oil drilling agenda in dire straights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“They’re dropping like flies,” he says. “One of the supposed-cornerstones of this Government’s economic strategy is its oil program, but it is totally failing with no new oil found in eight years of searching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“With the change of Prime Minister, the Government should quit this mad oil program once and for all.  We’re calling on soon-to-be new Prime Minister Bill English to face the planetary climate emergency and listen to iwi, public and local government opposition, and ditch deep sea drilling now.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In the last month Auckland Council, Christchurch City Council, Environment Canterbury, Dunedin Council and Gisborne Council voted to oppose offshore oil prospecting, exploration and drilling.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hawke’s Bay region is currently considering a ban on drilling and Kaikoura Councils have also historically opposed drilling.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Abel says Greenpeace is focused on the arrival of the world’s biggest seismic ship which recently began blasting in New Zealand waters.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;125-metre long ship, the Amazon Warrior, is owned by the world’s largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; is currently seismic blasting for oil between Napier and Kaikoura, an area inhabited by thousands of whales  and dolphins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This ship has been actively avoiding going into port because it knows it will face huge resistance and protest,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“It’s even gone to such lengths as to break maritime safety law and switch off transmission from its AIS tracking device, presumably so that peaceful protestors can’t find it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;An unprecedented alliance of Maori communities have voiced opposition to deep water drilling on the East Coast. Almost 70 Maori hapūfrom Cape Runaway to Kaikoura have called on Statoil and Chevron to cease their operations and leave New Zealand. Over 6,000 New Zealanders have signed on to the &lt;a href="https://www.toko.org.nz/petitions/norway-statoil-is-not-welcome-in-our-waters"&gt;&lt;span class="s4"&gt;letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Abel says the Amazon Warrior “can run but it can’t hide”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Our message to the Government and the oil industry is this: The ocean isn’t as big as it may seem. We will show New Zealanders exactly how you are blasting our marine environment and causing distress to our unique whales and dolphins - all in the name of climate-wrecking oil - and we will peacefully resist you until you leave our waters” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Groups campaigning on climate change, fracking, oil and gas drilling and social justice from across Aotearoa have announced plans to disrupt the New Zealand Petroleum Conference in March next year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/217889391953878/" target="_blank"&gt;The People's Climate Rally&lt;/a&gt; is being organised by a coalition of groups including Climate Justice Taranaki, Frack Free, Oil Free Wellington, Greenpeace New Zealand and 350 Aotearoa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two-day event, on March 22 and 23, will include peaceful protest, workshops, and entertainment for people of all ages that promotes a world without fossil fuels in order to curb the looming climate catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The target is the NZ Petroleum Conference, held over the same time in New Plymouth, which will see hundreds of delegates from oil and gas companies meet to discuss oil exploration opportunities in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sponsored by government agency NZPAM, the annual conference is  also attended by domestic decision makers including the Minister of Energy and Resources, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Taranaki Regional Council, and NIWA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously held in Auckland and Wellington, the petroleum conference has been met by mass peaceful protest since 2012. This has included hikoi and marches of more than 5,000 people. This year, a blockade outside Auckland’s SkyCity delayed the start of the conference by several hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conference has now been moved to New Plymouth for 2017. Taranaki has been the centre of the New Zealand oil industry for 100 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spokesperson for Climate Justice Taranaki, Emily Bailey, says  the oil industry and the Government has continued to exploit oil and gas and ignore local community concerns about its environmental and human costs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The oil and gas industry has been making a retreat this year, pulling out of permits and cutting investments,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Now they're moving from Auckland to hold their annual conference in what can only be seen as a retreat to 'safe territory', but we are stepping things up to tell them it's time to stop the drilling and ensure a future without runaway climate change.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand needs a rapid investment in a just transition away from these dirty fuels and into climate-friendly jobs, Bailey says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  coalition will be developing The People’s Climate Rally over the coming weeks. Kicking off just days after Taranaki music festival, WOMAD, the group is encouraging festival goers to stay on afterwards to take part in the protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;350 Aotearoa spokesperson, Niamh O'flynn, says the petroleum conference “flies in the face” of what is right for people and the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These companies and our Government are acting like drilling for more oil and gas has no consequences. We know that they do, and it's climate change,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“When our farmers are struggling through drought, our snowfields are without snow, and our sea-levels are rising, it's our responsibility to stand-up to the Government and the fossil fuel industry that are ignoring reality and wilfully wrecking our climate."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling out the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council on a so-called moratorium on the Ruataniwha dam.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Council is voting on a “moratorium” on the dam today. Greenpeace understands this will not include a prohibition on the Council's own legal action to acquire specially protected conservation land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It would be misleading of the Council to tell the public that a moratorium is in place when in truth it is still supporting a ratepayer-funded legal bid to drown protected conservation land to make way for the Ruataniwha dam," said Greenpeace campaigner Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The definition of moratorium is a temporary prohibition of activity.  That should include this legal activity and we are calling on the Council to pull out of the case."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Council's investment arm, HBRIC along with Minister of Conservation were yesterday granted leave to appeal a previous Court of Appeal decision that found downgrading specially protected conservation land to make way for the dam was unlawful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Conservation land belongs to all New Zealanders and not to companies wanting to destroy it for private profit," Toop said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If the Council’s investment arm pursues and wins this case, 22ha of protected conservation land would be drowned. More importantly, it sets a precedent whereby all of New Zealand’s specially protected conservation land can have its status downgraded at any time to make way for commercial activities like mining and industrial irrigation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning to stop the Ruataniwha Dam because it will mean the expansion of industrial dairying in Hawke’s Bay and more pollution of local rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	When it comes to clean water, industrial agriculture remains New Zealand’s biggest challenge, and large-scale irrigation schemes planned around the country are set to make things worse.

	The Dairy Industry has failed in its attempts to shut down a hard-hitting TV ad by Greenpeace. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;An advertising watchdog has ruled the campaign by New Zealand’s largest environmental organisation, truthful and not misleading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQOm37Szgow"&gt;Using kiwi kids splashing about in a clear stream,&lt;/a&gt; the ad points out that 60 per cent of New Zealand’s monitored rivers are now unfit to swim in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://web.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fgreenpeace.nz%2Fvideos%2F10154678982965775%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The Government is allowing our precious rivers to be destroyed,” says the advertisement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Precious water supplies are being polluted by industrial dairy farming and massive irrigation schemes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Advertising Standards Authority received a total of 12 complaints about the ad, including one from Dairy NZ.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In a ruling (due to be released tomorrow) the Advertising Standards Authority has rejected each one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“We’re not surprised by this decision,” says Greenpeace’s sustainable agriculture campaigner Genevieve Toop.  “It’s simple. The more dairy cows there are, the more polluted our rivers and streams become.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The ASA accepted Greenpeace’s position that “the impact of industrial dairy farming on water quality is widely documented.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This is the message that the dairy industry has tried, and failed, to stop the public from hearing,” says Toop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Attempts by the industrial dairying lobby to get the video banned actually had the opposite effect. It became known as “the ad they didn’t want you to see”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Following Dairy NZ’s complaint, more than a quarter of a million New Zealanders went online and viewed it on Greenpeace’s facebook page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The complaint laid by Dairy NZ claimed statements and images in the ad were “false and misleading”.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;These claims were thrown out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The ASA’s complaints board agreed that the statements made in the advertisement “would not come as a surprise to most New Zealanders.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Toop adds: “We would encourage Dairy NZ to concentrate its resources into addressing the very real problems of river degradation, rather than trying to pretend the problem doesn’t exist.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Greenpeace provided the ASA with a &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/reports/Greenpeace-NZ-Television---Complaint-16400/" target="_blank"&gt;13 page file of scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; pointing to nitrate and pathogen pollution of our waterways as a result of industrial dairying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Toop says the government’s own figures show 62 per cent of New Zealand’s monitored rivers are already unsafe for swimming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has repeatedly drawn a clear link between industrial dairying and water pollution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Industrial Dairying is being confronted with its own truth, and doesn’t like it,” says Toop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The  decision by the ASA confirms that we have a major problem. Our ever-expanding dairy industry is  polluting our waterways with sediment, pathogens and nitrates.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Toop says Greenpeace will continue to engage the public in the fight to stop the construction of big irrigation schemes. These would drain water from iconic rivers and lakes, using it to create even more industrial dairy farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	An unprecedented legal case has been filed against the Norwegian Government for allowing oil companies including state-owned Statoil to drill for new oil in the Arctic.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The case, part of a global legal phenomenon, comes only days after Statoil pulled the plug on its New Zealand operations in Northland, and just before a visit by Norway’s indigenous Sami Parliament, who are meeting with iwi around the country to discuss Statoil’s presence here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sami visit follows a Maori delegation to Norway last year, who met with local Sami indigenous people and attended the annual Statoil shareholders meeting to put the owners on notice that their investment in Aotearoa would be met by stiff resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal case filed against the Norwegian Government last night for allowing oil companies. including Statoil, to drill for new oil in the Arctic Barents Sea, is the first following the ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement. The plaintiffs, Nature and Youth and Greenpeace Nordic, argue that Norway is violating the Paris Agreement and the people's constitutional right to a healthy and safe environment for future generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner and lawyer, Kate Simcock, says the case could have implications around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “With the success of the Urgenda climate case against the Dutch Government, and now this, we're seeing that it's possible for ordinary people and smart legal tactics to hold governments to account on their plans to tackle climate change,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is a growing legal phenomenon.  We’re seeing it here too.  New Zealand's appalling emissions reduction targets are already under challenge and our Government should be watching this case very closely and re-thinking just what it means to have no plan for cutting our climate pollution.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around this time last year, 24-year-old Waikato law student Sarah Thomson commenced a case against the New Zealand Government, saying its emissions targets were irrational. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomson's case was one of the first of a ripple of climate litigation spreading around the globe, which have the backing of a broad civil society coalition, are fronted by young environmentalists, and supported by scientists, indigenous leaders, activists and public figures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like New Zealand, Norway was among the first countries in the world to ratify the Paris Agreement, which is about to enter into force. By ratifying, countries promise to ambitiously reduce emissions and help limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet at the same time, both countries are opening up new oil license rounds allowing companies to explore for the dirty fuels that scientists say must stay in the ground if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In New Zealand, the Government’s 2017 Block Offer consultation process has just started. The process involves NZPAM seeking input from iwi, hapū and local authorities about the proposed areas that will be opened for oil exploration in 2017. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year’s consultation round saw communities speaking out about local oil exploration, with councils in Gisborne, Wellington, Kaikoura, Christchurch and Dunedin all voicing concern or opposition to the proposal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In partnership with Chevron, Statoil will continue to prospect for oil in New Zealand’s lower East Coast waters.  And across the globe, the Norwegian Government is allowing Statoil and other oil companies to start a major new exploration campaign in the Barents Sea, where they want to drill up to seven new exploratory wells in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the oil company’s sudden exit from Northland and announcement that it will now focus attention on its East Coast permits, Greenpeace New Zealand has called for a “summer of action” to drive Statoil and other oil companies out of the country for good.&lt;/p&gt;

	A 12-month investigation by Greenpeace Southeast Asia has found that Thailand’s overseas fishing fleets are intentionally shifting to remote waters in order to avoid fishing regulations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The investigation started seven months after the Associated Press released its expose on shocking human rights abuses on Thailand’s notorious fishing industry, and demonstrates a very clear case for banning transshipment at sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The Thai government has tried to clamp down on human rights violations in the fishing industry but these Thai fleets remain as ruthless as ever,” said Anchalee Pipattanawattanakul, Oceans Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Our investigation shows that rather than changing the way they fish to meet the regulations, they are just shifting to isolated and less regulated fishing grounds outside the region.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Between 2014 and 2016 Greenpeace Southeast Asia tracked Thailand’s rogue overseas fishing vessels and found that, after fishing restrictions were imposed by the governments of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea in August 2015, as many as 76 Thai flagged vessels shifted their operations to the environmentally fragile Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, more than 7,000km away from Samut Sakhon, Thailand’s seafood epicentre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Maintaining fishing fleets in the distant Saya de Malha Bank requires routine journeys by reefer vessels of over 7,000 km, making transshipment at sea central to the Thai business model. This model allows the fishing vessels to remain at sea and out of reach of authorities, where they can operate outside the law. The reefers deliver supplies and sometimes trafficked workers, and pick up fish, with some shipments reported to include up to a 50% bycatch of sharks [2]/[3].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Turn the Tide&lt;/em&gt; report also found that the negligent use of trafficked, abused and underpaid local and foreign workers can lead to horrific outcomes such as the outbreak of beriberi disease [4]. An official investigation into six beriberi fatalities concluded that the men had died of heart failure caused by poor nutrition, overwork, and long periods at sea without returning to port, a situation that was enabled by transshipment at sea [5]/[6].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Furthermore, of the 15 trafficked survivors interviewed by Greenpeace Southeast Asia, almost half experienced physical violence on the vessels. One of the main reasons for beatings was illness, especially when there was insufficient food on-board and exhausted crew members would try to sneak off to rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The powerful Thai Overseas Fishing Association, which controls much of the billion dollar fishing industry, have eroded trust in their willingness to operate modern, sustainable and ethical businesses. Greenpeace and other Human Rights NGOs are asking them to change the way they operate to meet regulations for the sustainability and viability of the fishing and seafood sectors,” added Pipattanawattanakul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s supply chain investigations demonstrate the unacceptably high risk of tainted surimi [7] entering numerous seafood and non-seafood supply chains throughout 2016, including products destined for export which end up being raw ingredients for sushi and pet food products sold around the world.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"As long as transshipment at sea continues, it will be nearly impossible for any seafood company to guarantee that the fish they are selling is both sustainable and ethically caught,” said Oliver Knowles, Sustainable Tuna Project Leader at Greenpeace New Zealand. “The case for banning transshipments at sea grows stronger by the day. The evidence in our report puts more pressure on the Thai and international fishing industry to phase out this deeply problematic practice that allows so many problems to flourish.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Greenpeace is calling for greater control, including prioritising efforts to eliminate risky practices such as transshipment at sea, to be exerted over Thailand’s distant water fishing fleets. It recommends stricter monitoring and enforcement measures from the Thai government to ensure that only sustainably and ethically-produced Thai seafood reaches the shelves, freezers, sushi bars and cat bowls around the world.                                        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on further protection for Māui dolphin after the latest population estimate shows the number of the critically endangered dolphin has potentially risen.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Māui survey, carried out by DOC, MPI and researchers from Auckland and Oregon State Universities, estimates that there are now around 63 Māui left, up from the last estimate of 55 in a 2010-2011 survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says while it’s encouraging that indications are that there has been a small increase in the population of the world’s smallest and rarest dolphin, it does not change their critically endangered status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does, however, show that that the added protections that have been implemented over the years might be working, and must be continued, expanded and intensified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially pressing considering new and destructive human activities like seismic testing and seabed mining are now being planned and carried out in and around the Māui’s habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government to extend the dolphin’s marine mammal sanctuary refuge to cover their full habitat range, issue a ban on net fishing, seabed mining, petroleum exploration and drilling from within the sanctuary, and ban seismic testing from within 20 nautical miles of the sanctuary's boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 65,000 people have signed &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/mauidolphinpetition" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace’s petition on the matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that Māui may be travelling outside of the area that is currently protected.&lt;br&gt;Recent research shows Māui’s cousins, Hector’s dolphins, regularly travel outside of their normal habitat in winter, far away from safe waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Māui are doing the same, then they could be in grave danger. Currently, their protected zone only covers where they are known to be in summer.&lt;/p&gt;

	Upon its arrival in New Zealand waters, the world’s largest seismic surveying ship turned off transmission from its mandatory AIS safety device, including throughout the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit early on Monday morning and the subsequent tsunami threat.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The 125 metre long ship, owned by the world’s biggest oilfield services company, Schlumberger, has not transmitted from its Automatic Identification System (AIS) for the past five days, except only once briefly on Monday.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ship is searching for oil off the East Coast on behalf of oil giants Statoil and Chevron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boats are required under maritime safety laws to have their AIS on in the interests of safety and to prevent dangerous at-sea events like collisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner, Kate Simcock, says the ship seems to have purposefully turned off its AIS in order to hide from people protesting against its activities in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A kayak flotilla, organised by Oil Free Wellington and supported by Greenpeace, took place on Sunday around the time the ship was due into port in Wellington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s reckless and dangerous that during a time when New Zealand has been hit by a terrible earthquake, this ship has taken the law into its own hands in order to hide from some peaceful protestors,” Simcock says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It has sat out there somewhere between Napier and Kaikoura with its AIS safety system not transmitting its location throughout the earthquake, tsunami threats, and the huge storms that have been battering the lower North Island. Visibility at sea is vital for safety and it’s exactly at times like these that an AIS is so important. This ship must be held accountable to the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s crazy enough that in the teeth of a climate emergency, the John Key Government has invited the world’s biggest oil surveying machine to come and search for the oil that scientists say we can’t burn if we want a future for our families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But now this ship is doing everything possible, including breaking the law, to actively avoid the New Zealand public who are saying it is not welcome in their waters.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survey for oil, the ship will blast underwater sound waves from arrays that drag for kilometres behind it every eight seconds, all day and night, for months on end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boom of these sound waves reverberates throughout the ocean, and can have chronic impacts on whales and dolphins and potentially deafen whales. These marine creatures depend on their hearing to survive, whether it’s for feeding and nursing young, or communicating with mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ship will be seismic blasting between Napier and Kaikoura, an area inhabited by thousands of whales and dolphins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boat’s arrival in New Zealand coincided with two of the biggest local councils in the country, Auckland Council and Christchurch City Council, voting to oppose offshore oil prospecting, exploration and drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unprecedented alliance of Maori communities have also voiced opposition to deep water drilling on the East Coast. Almost 70 Maori hapū from Cape Runaway to Kaikoura have called on Statoil and Chevron to cease their operations and leave New Zealand. Over 6,000 New Zealanders have signed on to the &lt;a href="https://www.toko.org.nz/petitions/norway-statoil-is-not-welcome-in-our-waters" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz/videos/10154637677625775/"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; protesting seismic blasting posted on the Greenpeace New Zealand Facebook page has also struck a chord with the public, reaching 1.4 million people in just two days. It's now been shared 10,000 times and has amassed 3,500 comments since Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 20,000 people have sent emails to the CEOs of Statoil and Chevron, demanding they stop oil exploration in New Zealand waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says it’s clear that people do not want oil drilling in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is an insult to democracy if the Government does not pay attention to the public, hapū and councils all over the country saying decisively that they will not stand for a climate-destroying oil agenda,” she says.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As well as risking our future, seismic testing and drilling pose direct threats to our beaches and marine life, both through the distress the sound blasts used in seismic testing cause creatures of the ocean and through the risk of a devastating oil spill on our beaches.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	A recent change in the balance of power at the Auckland Council could see a vote against the Government’s offshore oil plans succeed today, where it has previously narrowly failed.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, Steve Abel, will be presenting to the council at 9:30am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are calling on the council to seize the nettle and say no to drilling that risks both catastrophic oil spills and climate change if oil is found,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Previous votes have been farcical, such as Auckland’s submission on the Block Offer last year, where an amendment was nearly passed that would have clearly indicated Auckland’s opposition to the drilling. Only Chair George Wood’s casting vote defeated the anti-drilling amendment, after a candidate apparently went to the loo and missed the vote”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the year, then-Mayor Len Brown’s vote narrowly defeated a similar amendment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is unclear which way the new Mayor Phil Goff will vote, but we think it’s a great opportunity for his new council to clearly signal their intention to take climate change seriously and say no to the fossil fuels we can’t burn if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change,” Abel says. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;During the 2015 Block Offer consultation, Christchurch Council unanimously passed a submission to the Government stating that the risks of deep sea drilling are too great. They reaffirmed this position for the 2016 Block Offer, and have in the last week again opposed the Block Offer for 2017 in a strong submission that was passed with only one dissenting vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more info:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie Schroder, Greenpeace NZ Media &amp;amp; Communications, 021 086 47450&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, Greenpeace NZ Senior Campaign Advisor, 021 927 301&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand is calling for a summer of action to highlight what it’s calling the Government’s “sham plan” to meet the Paris Climate Change Agreement, which came into force today.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Climate and Energy Campaigner, Kate Simcock, says despite being one of the first countries in the world to ratify the agreement, the New Zealand Government doesn’t yet have a plan for how it will curb climate emissions domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has committed to reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But information that Greenpeace received under the Official Information Act shows New Zealand is forecast to meet 80% of this target by offsetting our emissions in the international carbon market,” Simcock says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This means that currently our Government’s only action plan to meet our international obligations in the face of the climate emergency we’re facing is to buy our way out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If every country behaved the way we did, we'd literally be dead in the water.  It's not acceptable that we push the burden onto someone else so that we can keep polluting, it's utterly amoral as a global citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents obtained under the OIA also show that officials are well aware of the lack of a domestic plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will become increasingly more difficult to address the gap between domestic emissions and international targets under our current settings: We need a plan for how we deal with climate change beyond 2030,” one section states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simcock says the Government is in denial about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On his return from Paris a year ago, Prime Minister John Key stated he had no intention of scaling back oil exploration here. Instead the Government launched straight into the block offer process, where vast tracts of our ocean are allocated to oil companies to survey and drill,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If our so-called leaders won’t change a thing, then it’s up to New Zealanders. Two weeks ago we announced a ‘summer of action’, and it’s going to be big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re inviting everyone around the country to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The industry should expect community resistance at every turn, and the Government should prepare for a battering of its climate-denying oil agenda. This will all culminate at the next oil conference in Taranaki in March.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actress Lucy Lawless, who made international headlines in 2012 when she and six Greenpeace activists scaled the derrick of Shell oil drillship, the Noble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoverer, and camped there for more than 70 hours, will also be joining the summer of action.&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Solution - Ecological Farming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Genetic Engineering. Corporate control of people's food. Over reliance on pesticides and herbicides are not the solutions. So what is? Ecological Farming. It's safe. It's do-able. And it's happening now. Help us support farming for the future.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In favor of Ecological Farming: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological farming keeps food production in the hands of farmers and away from corporate control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological farming helps cope with climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.6 billion small-scale farmers already produce the majority of the world's food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological farming is proven to be more profitable for farmers in studies from Europe, Africa, Asia and America.&lt;/li&gt;

	Auckland, 30 May 2016 - Minister for MPI, Nathan Guy, has confirmed this morning that the fishing industry is indeed responsible for reviewing video surveillance from its own trawlers and reporting suspicious behaviour to the regulator, MPI.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/305148/minister-defends-fishing-industry-monitoring"&gt;Guy told Radio New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; that Trident - the industry owned partnership - analysed footage from the trawlers and then decided what it should to report to the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Trident does the summary, they alert MPI if there's anything they see that's suspicious,” Guy said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This confirms our worst fears,” says Russel Norman, Executive Director of Greenpeace New Zealand. “MPI have contracted out monitoring and analysis to the industry, and Nathan Guy and Prime Minister John Key are defending it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/press/Fisheries-companies-win-contract-to-monitor-themselves/"&gt;Yesterday Greenpeace blew the whistle on MPI&lt;/a&gt; awarding a contract to Trident, a firm wholly owned and controlled by the fishing industry, to electronically monitor the SNA1 with video and GPS technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MPI’s Minister, Guy, tried to defend the move this morning, saying, “MPI gets a summary of that footage, it can't be tampered with, it's securely stored..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Greenpeace’s Norman says the key word in Guy’s statement this morning is “summary”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The  fishing industry owned and controlled organisation decides what footage they should red flag to MPI,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Let’s be clear about that: MPI contracts Trident to view and summarise the footage. Trident decides what to put in its report to MPI. MPI have contracted policing our fisheries to the very industrial fishing companies that most need policing, and both Nathan Guy and Prime Minister John Key seem to think this is okay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Anyone who cares about sustainable fisheries or just being to catch a fish for the family dinner, will not think this is okay at all.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand has teamed up with researchers at the University of Auckland in an effort to discover more about the critically endangered Māui dolphin, including where they go in winter.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The project was launched yesterday, and the team have already spotted three Māui - almost 5% of the entire global population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/oceans/2016/finding-maui/_47Q8157.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="406"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best estimates show there are only about 63 left, and even catching a glimpse of one is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scientists have information about the preferred habitat of Māui dolphins in summer, very little is known about  where they go in the colder water months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading the collaboration with Greenpeace is Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland’s School of Biological Sciences,  Dr Rochelle Constantine. She is being assisted by PhD student of the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Auckland, Olivia Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton says research shows Māui dolphins closest relative, Hector’s dolphins, are travelling outside of their normal habitat in winter, away from protected waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Māui are doing the same, they may be moving outside of the current sanctuary into areas where there are human related threats,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With so few Māui left,  we need to gather all of the information we can about their distribution in order to understand how we can best protect the population".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be taking the researchers out in inflatable boats through until the end of November, where they’ll be monitoring the seas between Manukau Harbour and Port Waikato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Māui spotted yesterday were milling in one of their summer hot spots, in turbid waters close to shore, south of the Manukau Heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says it was the first time he’d ever seen a Māui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are such beautiful creatures. They are tiny and surprisingly fast, and very distinctive with their Mickey Mouse dorsal fins and black and grey colouring. It was bittersweet  realising that the three that darted around our boat for half an hour actually represent 5% of the entire global population of Māui,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/oceans/2016/finding-maui/_47Q7951.jpg" alt="Greenpeace New Zealand has teamed up with researchers at the University of Auckland in an effort to discover more about the critically endangered Maui dolphin, including where they go in winter Greenpeace/Nigel Marple" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says the collaboration with University of Auckland researchers is a great opportunity to combine Greenpeace’s resources and ocean experience with expert scientific research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fate of the world’s most endangered dolphin hangs in the balance,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their current protected zone is too small and only provides partial protection of where we know they like to be in summer. It doesn’t take into account confirmed sightings of the dolphins outside of that area, or the possibility that they can travel large distances - especially in colder water months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Net fishing has always been the biggest Māui killer, but they’re also coming up against new threats like seabed mining and seismic testing for oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to help gather more information about Māui so that we can demand better protection for them makes sense. We all need to pitch in wherever possible to give our Māui a fighting chance.”     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government to extend the dolphin’s marine mammal sanctuary refuge to cover their full habitat range, issue a ban on net fishing, seabed mining, petroleum exploration and drilling from within the sanctuary, and ban seismic testing from within 20 nautical miles of the sanctuary's boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 65,000 people have signed Greenpeace’s &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=44363"&gt;petition on the matter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has joined forces with an Indigenous Amazonian community in an unofficial demarcation of their land, deep in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/forests/GP1STODC_PressMedia.jpg" alt="Munduruku people pose near a tree with a  demarcation sign.The Munduruku people have inhabited the Sawré Muybu in the heart of the Amazon, for generations. The Brazilian government plans to build a series of dams in the Tapajos River basin, which would severely threaten their way of life. The Munduruku demand the demarcation of their territory which would ensure protection from such projects. In addition to preserving their way of life, the demarcation of Sawré Muybu ensures the conservation of 178,000 hectares of Amazonian rainforest.O povo Munduruku habita a Terra Indígena Sawré Muybu, no coração da Amazônia, há gerações. Mas seu modo de vida esta ameaçado pelos planos do governo brasileiro de construir um complexo de barragens na bacia do Rio Tapajos. Os Munduruku exigem a demarcação de seu território. Além de garantir o modo de vida deste povo, a demarcação de Sawré Muybu garante a conservação de 178 mil hectares de floresta amazônica." width="595" height="445"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demarcation is the latest effort in a global campaign to protect the Tapajós River from the construction of a massive dam, the São Luiz do Tapajós (SLT), which would lead to devastating rainforest destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munduruku Indigenous Peoples, who have been fighting against the dam and for the formal recognition of their land for many years, have sparked a global movement for the protection of the Tapajós and are calling on global companies to distance themselves from the controversial project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, a group of New Zealanders will arrive at Sawré Muybu Indigenous village to assist the Munduruku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ’s Annette Cotter is one of the team currently working to save the Tapajós River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it’s important that New Zealanders follow the story of the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Amazon might seem far away, but saving the rainforest is critical for us all.  Not only does the Amazon help regulate global weather patterns but it's protection is essential if we are to limit dangerous climate change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Munduruku are asking for global help to protect their land from this huge threat - help that we can all give, no matter where we live."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, a global petition was &lt;a href="https://en-nz.heartoftheamazon.org/"&gt;launched &lt;/a&gt;to “save the heart of the Amazon”. Signatures will form a virtual human chain around the Munduruku territory in an effort to pressure the Brazilian Government to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juarez, the chief (cacique) of Munduruku Sawré Muybu Indigenous land, says the movement has relevance across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This an important battle not just for the Munduruku people, but for everyone around the world since we are talking about one of the biggest forests that still exist in the planet,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ground, the land demarcation involves marking the land with fifty signs, similar to those used by the Brazilian government, to indicate the territory is Munduruku land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demarcation process would normally be executed by the Brazilian Government as the next step in a formal Indigenous Land recognition process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placing the signs is just one of a range of activities planned at the Sawré Muybu Indigenous village - another will include installing solar panels in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved, the SLT dam would be the first of five planned in the Tapajós River. It would have a reservoir of 729 square kilometers (almost the size of New York City), which would flood part of the Munduruku land, and it would drive an estimated 2,200 km2 of indirect deforestation as a result of roads and other infrastructure related to the construction and migration to the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on international companies like Siemens to confirm they will not get involved in the project by supplying components like the generators. Although their company profile is focused on green solutions, Siemens were involved in the controversial Belo Monte dam, the most recent destructive dam to be built in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland Council has just voted to oppose the Government’s offshore oil agenda in New Zealand, for the first time ever.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The vote this morning saw 14 councillors including, new Mayor Phil Goff, pass an amendment to oppose oil prospecting, exploration and drilling in New Zealand, while only 7 voted in support of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Steve Abel, who spoke at the meeting, says the win is historic and decisive, and sends a clear signal that the John Key Government’s oil agenda is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a massive result. It means two of the biggest councils in the country have now come out in strong defiance of the Government’s climate-destroying policy of searching for the oil we can’t burn if we are to have a future for our children,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Government does not pay attention to this it would be an insult to democracy, it would expose the consultation as a sham, and it would be straight up climate denial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Christchurch City Council opposed oil drilling, with only one dissenting vote in favour of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2015, Kaikoura, Dunedin and Gisborne Councils also voted to oppose offshore oil activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel says Auckland’s new Mayor Phil Goff should be congratulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, Mayor Len Brown let us down, with his vote being the decisive vote in Auckland Council not opposing oil drilling,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today the new Auckland Council has taken this opportunity to define itself as serious about taking climate action. And Mayor Goff stood with the growing swell of New Zealanders who see that a continued search for oil that we can’t afford to burn is craziness given the climate emergency we face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auckland Council’s vote to oppose oil drilling in New Zealand will now be submitted to Central Government to consider for the 2017 Block Offer process, which decides which tracts of New Zealand ocean will be opened up to oil companies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Is relying on toxic chemicals the only way forward? Can 'business as usual' in agriculture provide food for the future? Greenpeace is working on all this and more.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agriculture is responsible for 14 percent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;a title="ecological farming" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/agriculture/solution-ecological-farming/"&gt;Ecological farming&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce these emissions, and help farmers cope with climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="genetic engineering" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/"&gt;Genetic Engineering&lt;/a&gt; makes us dependent on toxic chemicals and corporate control of agriculture. It poses unknown risks to our environment - and ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groundwater contamination, fewer places to fish and more pests resistant to pesticides: These are just some of the problems arising from industrial polluting agriculture's addiction to toxic chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological farming can produce 30 percent more food per hectare. Ecological farming gives people access to food where it is needed most.&lt;/li&gt;

            Greenpeace activists aboard the 'Federal Pescadores' carrying GE soy. The activists attached themselves to onboard cranes and the anchor chain of the cargo ship to prevent the cargo being unloaded.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ten years of commercial growing 85% of GE crops are still grown in just three countries: Argentina, Canada and the US. This means that in the overwhelming majority of countries commercial growing is only happening on a merely symbolic scale or not at all. Africa, Europe, Russia, the Pacific and most of Asia are still GE free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the genetic engineering industry is rapidly loosing the last bit of credibility, as illegal GE foods are entering the foodchain, such as what happened with Bayer GE rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the support for GE crops is eroding because more and more scientific publications are showing the health and environmental dangers of genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least - the overwhelming majority of consumers around the world are opposed to genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to the rejection of GE foods by major supermarkets and foodcompanies, among them Carrefour, Unilever and McDonalds. If this rejection trend continues, the incentive for growing GE crops will eventually disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People all over the world from consumers to scientists are saying NO to GE crops. By saying we want to stay GE free we are winning the fight to keep our environment and food chain natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Greenpeace's stance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to the release of genetically engineered organisms (GE organisms) into the environment and the food chain. Greenpeace is also against the patenting of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE organisms have been released without adequate knowledge about their effects on the ecology, wildlife and human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace does not campaign against the contained use of GE organisms, such as for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Greenpeace demands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The safety of consumers and the environment should be more important than  the commercial interest of the genetic engineering industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GE foods should be withdrawn from the market, as they are unwanted, unneeded and unsafe;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genetic engineering industry should be held liable for any damage to the environment and or human health that occurs as a result of the release of GE foods and GE crops.&lt;/li&gt;

	In response to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report “Climate change and Agriculture: Understanding biological greenhouse gases”, Greenpeace Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner Genevieve Toop said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This report confirms that expanding industrial agriculture and meeting our international climate commitments are not compatible. We need systemic change in the way we farm.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The PCE states the obvious - more cows mean more emissions, and as such the last thing we should be doing is ushering in a new wave of industrial dairying via large scale irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The report also confirms that waiting on techno fixes is not an option. Luckily there’s a proven, profitable and eminently sustainable alternative ready to go  - ecological farming. Switching to eco-farming would not only reduce emissions, but also protect our soil and water. Hopefully the ECE’s report will spur focus on and investment in this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand is not hamstrung over agricultural emissions. There’s plenty we can do. It’s just not what we’ve always done.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 29 May 2016 - Greenpeace today revealed that the seafood company Sanford, and several other large New Zealand fishing companies, own the entity to which MPI recently awarded a contract to install cameras and to electronically monitor fishing at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This is like the fox guarding the henhouse,” says Russel Norman, Executive Director of Greenpeace New Zealand. “The Government has awarded the contract to monitor fishing companies to an entity owned and controlled by the very same fishing companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trident Systems, the firm that won the contract from MPI for electronic monitoring, is a limited partnership. Its general partner is a company called Trident Systems General Partner Limited, which is 42% owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanford. This Sanford subsidiary is also a limited partner in Trident Systems. The remainder of the shareholders and limited partners in Trident are made up by a selection of other New Zealand fishing and seafood companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is especially troubling,” says Norman, “because three separate MPI investigations have indicated Sanford were either engaged in potentially illegal activities, or the vessels supplying them were engaged in potentially illegal behaviour.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve now seen several leaked MPI investigation reports that variously found that fishing companies were not reporting all of the fish they caught, misreporting fish weight, discarding huge amounts of dead fish, and not reporting dolphin deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve got a serious problem with badly behaved fishing companies, and what do MPI do? They award the contract to monitor fishing boats to an entity owned and controlled by the fishing companies themselves.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman believes there is something seriously wrong at MPI and in New Zealand’s fishing industry. Three leaked MPI reports found evidence of likely offending in the Sanford supply chain, yet MPI chose not to prosecute Sanford or anyone else, and then buried the reports which exposed the illegal activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace can also reveal that Trident’s registered office and contact address is level 6, 135 Victoria Street, Wellington. This is the address of Seafood New Zealand (Seafic), a powerful seafood industry funded lobby group. It is also the address of FishServe, an administrative support service for the fishing industry, owned by Seafic. Seafic are also contracted to provide administrative support for Trident. Trident appears to be anything but an independent and objective watchdog for the industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“To rub salt into the wound,” says Norman, “MPI has not only engaged a fishing industry controlled entity to monitor and report on itself, but taxpayers are paying for the monitoring.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In apparent response to the public outcry the Minister for Primary Industries, Nathan Guy, has asked officials to bring forward the installation of 1400 fishing vessels with cameras, vessel monitoring systems and electronic reporting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But if this monitoring of 1400 fishing vessels is done by an entity that the fishing companies control then the public will have no confidence in this monitoring”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What has emerged since the release of the University of Auckland's catch reconstruction report are a series of troubling facts that suggest MPI has repeatedly failed to prosecute Sanford, is hopelessly compromised, perhaps even captured, by New Zealand fishing industry interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These facts, together with the clear links between Sanford and the National led government, and in particular links between the National Party and Sanford, are troubling and why an independent Commission of Inquiry is needed into MPI and its regulation of the fishing industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The release of a University of Auckland catch reconstruction report saw academics, environmental NGOs, recreational fishing groups, and Matt Watson, host of the ITM Fishing Show, calling for MPI to be investigated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When you’ve got the greenies, the rec fishers, and academics all on the same page, it shows you’ve got a serious problem, and that’s not going to be fixed by the fishing companies policing themselves,” said Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MPI proposed electronic camera monitoring as a solution to monitor and enforce fisheries regulations by commercial fishing trawlers in the SNA1 fishery. SNA1 fishery is the largest and most valuable inshore fishery in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In July 2015 MPI issued a Request for Proposals (RFP), seeking proposals from organisations that would:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Record 100% of fishing activity in SNA1&lt;br&gt;Recording and reporting the volume of undersize snapper returned to the water&lt;br&gt;Monitoring the application of the”fishers move on rule”&lt;br&gt;Identify and report instances of suspected non-compliance with fishing regulations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The RFP required the provider to review camera footage and report to MPI monthly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trident Systems LP was awarded the tender on 17 December 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trident Systems LP is registered with the Companies Office as a Limited Partnership.

	Feel like issues that concern you aren’t getting enough media coverage? 
Want to reach a broader audience than just your friends family and colleagues? 
Want to contribute to the national debate about an issue? 
Want to encourage others to take action to create a better world? 
 Using the media is an effective way to reach people that you want to hear your message.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div class="hub-text-above"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media has far-reaching scope, through radio, TV, newspapers and the internet and. harnessing this influential power is a vital tactic in the campaign toolkit. It prevents issues from disappearing from the public eye, stimulates more media interest in covering the issue, creates public debate and moves people to take action. All of which we need to win campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking that you need to get into national or international media publications or onto the stations with the widest scope for your message to be effective, and to make a difference. But local and regional media are just as effective. A local paper is read by many people, and what happens in people's backyards directly affects their lives, so there's a higher vested interest in the topic for the reader. Local and regional media also cuts across social groups, for example your local free paper goes through every door, regardless of age, income, education or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for making change, or simply want people to know what's going on, then &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/take-action/media/letter-writing/"&gt;write to newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Press Release" href="/new-zealand/en/take-action/media/writing-a-press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;write a press release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/take-action/media/radio/"&gt;call talkback radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s been revealed that a Hawke’s Bay Regional councillor could stand to make money if the Council approves a controversial and polluting dam that’s set to cost close to $1 billion.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The councillor, Deborah Hewitt, owns a property that falls within the proposed area to be supplied with water from the planned Ruataniwha Dam. The land value of those within this irrigation zone is expected to increase if construction of the dam goes ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s understood Hewitt began the process of declaring the conflict of interest yesterday, a day after Greenpeace New Zealand and more than a dozen others requested an official inquiry into the issue following information obtained under the Official Information Act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OIA request had resulted in the release of a map that outlined the addition of an extra irrigation zone to the scheme area. Hewitt’s property sits inside this new area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, Gen Toop, says it’s “plain wrong” that Hewitt hasn’t declared a conflict of interest until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s uncanny timing that the council has only acknowledged this conflict of interest after people started making noise about it. It begs the question, if it wasn’t for public pressure, would it have been declared?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toop says any decisions that have been made from when the new map was created in November 2015, until now, must be reviewed in light of Hewitt’s admission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Councilor Hewitt has been part of critical decision-making about the future of Ruataniwha - decisions that could lead to her gaining financially,” she says.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha come at the cost of our rivers and use our taxpayer and ratepayer dollars to get off the ground.  It’s just plain wrong that a Councillor, who could make private profit off the back of public money, was involved in any of that decision-making.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toop says Greenpeace is calling on the Ruataniwha process to be halted until such time as an external review about the conflict of interest has been completed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If this project is to have any shred of legitimacy, the issue needs to be addressed immediately,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a column written for Hawke’s Bay Today, registered valuer Greg Morice said speculation about Ruataniwha has already caused a rise in value of properties that sit in its irrigation footprint.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proposed 25-storey high concrete dam will take water from the Makaroro River and use it to intensify dairying in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toop says the Ruataniwha Dam will be a major polluter of the waterways in the area if it goes ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our rivers are already being severely polluted by industrial dairying, and this will only get worse with the addition of more irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ecological farming is much better for our rivers, our land and our international reputation. It’s this that we should be backing, not some failed industrial agriculture model which is polluting our rivers and bankrupting our farmers.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace NZ is launching a legal challenge against a controversial plan to build a dam that’s set to cost close to $1 billion and will pollute a region’s rivers.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today, Greenpeace will file a judicial review of resource consents granted by the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council to extend the area of land area that can be irrigated by the Ruataniwha scheme, which will aid the expansion of dairy farms in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion, to be lodged at the High Court in Napier, challenges two resource consents given to the Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company in January, which were granted without public notification on the basis of a Council assessment that any environmental effects would be no more than “minor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, Gen Toop, describes the move to grant the consents without notifying the public as “inconceivable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The public are being asked to fork out hundreds of millions of dollars on a dam that will cause more industrial dairy farming and more pollution of our rivers. It's just wrong that the public, who will lose out on clean rivers thanks to the dam, have been shut out of this process,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s legal challenge comes less than a year after 17 original consents and a notice of requirement related to the scheme were granted to the investment company by a Board of Inquiry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That process saw significant public interest and opposition, and involved almost 400 submissions and close to 30,000 pages of evidence, many about the risks to water quality in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toop says Greenpeace will now wait for a hearing date, but she expects the Council and investment company will request an urgent hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All signs suggest they’re not interested in what the public have to say about the environmental and financial dangers of this scheme, and are dead-set on pushing it through as quickly as possible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than backing this dam and the broken industrial dairy farming model, this council should be investing in ecological farming, which is infinitely better for our rivers, our land and our international reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;

	An investment company is demanding the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council hand over $80 million of ratepayer money for a controversial and polluting dam, prior to formal checks and balances being completed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a extraordinary Regional Council meeting at that kicks off at 10:30am today, the Hawke's Bay Regional Investment Company (HBRIC) is requesting access to the ratepayer money for the Ruataniwha Dam project, despite not having written confirmation from other investors or financiers that they will also fund the scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The public will be excluded from the first part of the meeting and will only be allowed to enter council chambers from 1pm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critics say the dam, which will be used to expand dairy farming in the area through irrigation, will lead to increased river pollution and farmer bankruptcy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From midday, outraged members of the Hawke’s Bay community plan to gather outside the Regional Council building in Napier to implore councillors not to allow HBRIC access to their money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A van emblazoned with the words, “ACC dirty delivery – public money for dodgy dams” will arrive to drop off large bags of mock ‘taxpayer’ money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Ruataniwha failed to secure any private investors, government department ACC has been marred by accusations that it too is set to prop up the scheme using taxpayer money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In May, Greenpeace NZ dumped six tonnes of dairy sewerage in sealed containers outside ACC’s Wellington offices and challenged it to deny these rumours. As yet, ACC has refused to confirm or deny the potential investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, Gen Toop, says the Ruataniwha dam has been “dogged by controversy since day one”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it stands, the dam has failed to secure $330 million needed to begin construction, and its overall costs have ballooned to almost $1 billion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve seen huge public opposition, two private investors pulling out of the project, and both Greenpeace and Forest and Bird in an ongoing court battle with HBRIC and the Regional Council over resource consents and access to conservation land,” Toop says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It would be a terrible misuse of public money if today the Regional Council were to hand over $80 million for a scheme that’s polluting, unstable and doesn’t have the required funds to go ahead. If the whole thing goes belly up, the ratepayer will have wasted millions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the last elections, the Regional Council has been divided on the issue of the dam, but with a narrow 5-4 vote in its favour, it has been pushing ahead with plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toop says irrigation from Ruataniwha would lead to “devastating” pollution of rivers in the Hawke’s Bay region.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;“Millions of tons of pollution ends up in our rivers every year already. This is only set to get worse with the expansion of dairy farming through irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha. To think that everyday Kiwis could be used as a cash cow to pollute our own rivers is offensive,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ecological farming is much better for our waterways, our land and our international reputation. It’s this that our government and local councils should be backing, not some failed industrial agriculture model.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand’s Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, has blasted Stephen Joyce’s first Budget for “actively funding” pollution. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Norman says the just-released Budget pours money into subsidising water and climate pollution, and does nothing to address the agriculture sector’s spiralling emissions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Government has already allocated around half a billion taxpayer dollars to subsidise industrial-scale irrigation schemes around the country, which will result in more cows and more polluted rivers. And now it has just proudly announced it will be injecting even more cash into it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s also subsidising the climate emissions from agriculture to the tune of around $500 million per year, based on the 2016 Budget figures. Agriculture, New Zealand’s largest polluter, is currently excluded from the Emissions Trading Scheme, which means that taxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for the sector’s emissions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As a very basic right I’d say New Zealanders deserve a Budget that doesn’t actively fund the destruction of our culture and environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Put it this way: If the only thing we did right now was to stop spending money on increasing pollution, it would still be hugely significant for both the climate and for our long-term economy.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice, Norman would like to see an end to public subsidies of big irrigation and the cut-rate royalty schemes that aid the expansion of the oil industry, as well as bringing the agriculture sector into a strengthened  Emissions Trading Scheme. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The next step would be for those savings to be reallocated into a strategy that promotes investment in the growth of the clean energy, sustainable transport and ecological agriculture,” he says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace NZ has pooled together its renewable energy and legal experts to create a solar hot desk service that will assist people stung by New Zealand’s first-ever charge for using solar.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In April, lines company Unison, which covers the Hawke’s Bay, Taupo and Rotorua, announced it would be increasing fees for any households generating their own electricity through technology like solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s climate and energy campaigner, Simon Boxer, calls the move “a solar tax, through and through”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unison and any other power company considering doing something similar should prepare for a fight,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will use the solar hot desk to offer advice to anyone affected by Unison’s solar penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxer says this will include helping people challenge it by making a complaint to the Electricity Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar hot desk follows last week’s launch of a national &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=52200&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace.org&amp;amp;utm_medium=lightbox&amp;amp;utm_term=lightbox&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Climate&amp;amp;__surl__=IgNdF&amp;amp;__ots__=1466457810049&amp;amp;__step__=1"&gt;petition &lt;/a&gt;to the Electricity Authority on the issue, which has already surpassed 20,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the Electricity Authority is the watchdog of New Zealand’s power, we expect them to step up to the plate, protect solar and regulate to prohibit power providers from penalising solar users,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no word for this other than a tax. Unison claims solar users need to pay their fair share of the grid costs, but they already are. Like everyone, solar users contribute to the grid when they use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fee means that if someone chooses to put solar on their roof in the Unison service area, they will now pay a higher rate for their electricity. It’s only aimed at solar, Boxer says. People who install a wood burner, gas fire or any other heating system in their home to lower their power bill will not have to pay the same fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most outrageous part about it is that solar power being generated today is actually strengthening local grids. The power solar users create is fed to their neighbours at very low cost compared to importing it from large power stations,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obvious that Unison’s solar tax is aimed at slowing and stopping solar adoption. Power providers want to stick to the status quo because it’s making them lots of money, and people generating their own energy threatens that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But come on - we’re in the midst of a climate crisis. All burning of dirty fuels like coal, oil and gas has to stop within a few decades if we want to avoid runaway climate change. Every renewable energy option that helps eliminate burning these fuels must be rolled out, and solar is a crucial part of that. It’s bizarre that we’re penalising people who want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unison’s solar charge follows a series of other moves by electricity heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, Genesis Energy announced it would keep burning coal at Huntly, New Zealand’s last coal-fired power station, until at least 2022, despite a previous promise to turn stop by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s understood the controversial deal was brokered in closed-door meetings between Genesis,  Huntly’s owner, and power companies including Meridian Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxer expects to see more push-back on clean energy from the electricity sector in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already heard whispers that Unison’s solar tax is just the thin end of the wedge. I wouldn’t be surprised if other lines companies around the country are right now preparing to do the same thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They see that because solar power is at an early stage of adoption here, any new grid charges or unnecessary red tape will put people off. But if we can all fight Unison on this, the electricity industry will have to think twice.” &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the Government to end public subsidies to think-big irrigation schemes that will create new intensive dairy farms and more freshwater pollution.

	The Government has asked for more time to take a case against three Greenpeace activists who put themselves in the path of the world’s largest seismic oil ship, the Amazon Warrior, in April. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, volunteer, Sara Howell, and Ashburton kite maker, Gavin Mulvay, were due to enter a plea in the Napier District Court on May 31.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Yesterday the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) requested an adjournment.  Now Greenpeace is calling on the Government Department to drop the charges altogether.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This case is morally repugnant,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Government is prosecuting climate activists and pandering to oil companies. Instead of protecting our communities and environment, the Government is wasting time and resources on taking peaceful protesters to court.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman and the two other activists are the first people in New Zealand to be charged under a controversial amendment to the Crown Minerals Act, known as the “Anadarko Amendment”. It was passed in 2013 to quash protest against oil vessels at sea.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;MBIE has asked for a delay in the case because it has yet to get its paperwork ready.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says Greenpeace has &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=68140&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace.org&amp;amp;utm_medium=press+release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=climate&amp;amp;utm_content=press+release"&gt;launched a petition&lt;/a&gt; for the charges to be dropped.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We’re calling on MBIE to drop the charges against us and listen to the thousands of people up and down the country who are demanding climate action,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Amazon Warrior is out there blasting our ocean floor in search of the very oil we can’t burn if we want a stable climate for us and our kids. Climate change is threatening everyone and everything, and it’s getting a whole lot worse.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In New Zealand this year, we’ve seen a deluge of devastating storms, flooding, droughts and fires in the space of a few short months. Climate change is only going to make these extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand has labeled Trump “morally bankrupt” over his decision abandon the Paris Climate Agreement, and is calling on Prime Minister Bill English to stand with other world leaders and speak out against the move.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says Trump’s posture will prove impotent in the face of an unstoppable global movement for bringing an end to the age of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a morally-bankrupt decision that Trump will come to regret. Global climate action is not a legal or political debate, it is an inescapable obligation to protect people and planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is moving forward without the US, who has now essentially surrendered any global leadership. We are witnessing a huge shift in the global order as countries like Europe and China begin to lead the way forward,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leaders everywhere have reacted strongly to Trump’s isolationist stance, and indicated that his mad agenda actually encourages them to break away from fossil fuels even faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s time for our Prime Minister to show show some moral courage and step up to the plate to stand with world leaders who are committing to take urgent climate action. He could begin by stopping any new oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Denying climate change and the rapid rise of clean energy is desperate and futile. The world is already making the transition at breakneck speed. Renewables now make up more than half of the world’s new power capacity (1), and are growing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen tens of millions of people around the world march, blockade and take action to demand this transition, and political leaders are listening. Trump’s decision is not going to stop the other 193 nations that accept the science of climate change and are signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Fossil Fuel President is impotent when it comes to halting renewables. The global economy’s transition to clean energy cannot be reversed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simcock says the timing of Trump’s decision is especially pertinent for New Zealand because the world’s biggest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior, is currently blasting for oil off the Wairarapa Coast on behalf of oil giants Statoil and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Trump have investments in Chevron, but Chevron was a major funder of his presidential inauguration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In April, Greenpeace took its newly crowdfunded boat, Taitu, on a three-day journey to stop the Amazon Warrior from seismic blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest saw three activists, including Greenpeace NZ executive director Russel Norman, put themselves in the water in front of the ship, forcing it to halt its operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in New Zealand history, the protestors have been charged with interfering with an oil exploration ship under Section 101B(1)(c) of the Crown Minerals Act, known as the Anadarko Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio were served the charges not by the police, but by MBIE – the petroleum division of the Government. They each face fines of up to $50,000 and 12 months in prison if convicted.&lt;br&gt;“This monster of a seismic blasting ship is out here in our pristine oceans doing Trump’s dirty work,” says Simcock.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The New Zealand Government must stop their mad search for oil that we cannot afford to burn if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. New Zealand has Paris Climate Agreement obligations to fulfil, and if our Government persists with its reckless oil exploration, then we have a moral duty to act.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Next Tuesday the US Secretary of State - former ExxonMobil boss, Rex Tillerson, is arriving in Wellington.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large-scale protests are being planned outside Parliament. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has called for an overhaul of the electricity industry after a complaint against a tax on solar was quashed in court.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Solar energy company, Solarcity, had been awarded a full hearing to test whether an extra charge for solar users was in breach of electricity industry codes, but yesterday the High Court ruled that the challenge could not proceed as there was no jurisdiction for the Rulings Panel, an independent electricity appeals body, to hear it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The case came after Hawke’s Bay lines company, Unison, introduced a solar tax last April. A Greenpeace petition about the tax has received almost 80,000 signatures.   Greenpeace campaigner, Kate Simcock, says the High Court decision is disappointing as it essentially allows companies like Unison to continue penalising solar users.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The fact that this ridiculous tax cannot be properly challenged shows that the electricity industry in New Zealand is not accountable to anyone. Electricity is a closely guarded commodity that’s being run to serve private interests,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Not only is this an industry that keeps prices high and on the rise, but it’s also systematically stifling the growth of the clean technology like solar that we urgently need in the face of a climate catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “It’s morally repugnant that big electricity players are knowingly taking steps to slow the uptake of solar because they see it as a threat to their bottom line. It’s time for the Government to overhaul this diseased industry.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the effects of climate change continue to worsen, New Zealand has seen a deluge of extreme weather events, including floods, cyclones and droughts, in the space of just a few months.   Drought in the South Island has been so bad this year it’s deprived the hydro dams of water. As a result, the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world – coal - has made a comeback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been revealed that the New Zealand’s last coal-fired power station in Huntly is now firing up at full capacity, with owner Genesis Energy even buying extra coal from Indonesia to power it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April last year, Genesis announced it would be keeping Huntly’s coal burners on for at least another four years, despite previously promising to turn them off by 2018. This followed closed-door discussions by several power companies, including Meridian Energy, to subvert the decision to shut the burners down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says New Zealand should never be in a position where it’s burning dirty energy like coal in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Renewables already make up more than half of the world’s new power capacity and you’d think ‘clean, green’ New Zealand should be at the forefront of that,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Instead, over the past year we’ve seen major electricity players conspire to keep dirty fuels burning with no regard for the climate crisis facing our communities or the consumers who are getting a bad deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is an electricity industry that has been allowed to run rogue for too long.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says the Dairy Industry’s new “action plan” on climate change is completely lacking in any form of serious action.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It‘s a charter to keep doing sweet nothin’ about the biggest problem facing New Zealand and the world, says campaigner Amanda Larsson.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of New Zealand’s biggest polluters - the Dairy Industry - produces half of our agricultural greenhouse gases, responsible for 50 per cent of the country's overall emissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dairy leadership has  been given a free pass on the Emissions Trading Scheme which is the Government’s only way of trying to control the problem.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Today’s so-called action plan commits itself to “climate change workshops” and “discussion groups” but says nothing about any concrete actions to reduce emissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This report is all talk and no trousers,” says Greenpeace campaigner Amanda Larsson.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“They used to outright deny climate change and do nothing. Now they accept it's real but still want to do nothing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“When Big Dairy says, ‘There are currently limited cost-effective options to reduce emissions’, they are deliberately ignoring the most obvious and most environmentally effective action that will cut emissions and pollution in general – reduce cow numbers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Dairy Industry still wants more cows. Government funded big irrigation schemes are providing the means to increase and intensify the herd.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The fact is that by cutting cow numbers there are a multitude of benefits – cleaner rivers, fewer costly inputs for farmers like PKE, fertiliser and irrigation, and less greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Big irrigation is bad for the climate and it’s also bad for existing dairy farmers who are legitimately trying to clean up their farms.  All their good work to reduce climate and water pollution will  be cancelled out by additional pollution from new intensive dairy conversions created under these irrigation schemes.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dairy bosses and the Government  keep ignoring the simplest and most effective way to reduce climate emissions and river pollution – fewer cows.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is advocating a switch to modern forms of farming which produce higher value products with lower stock numbers and less environmental pressure on the land, rivers and air.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Major tourism, conservation and recreation organisations behind Freshwater Rescue Plan, announced yesterday, compare Labour’s water policy to their seven step plan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Labour’s freshwater policy is much more ambitious than the current Government’s approach to protecting the country’s rivers and lakes, but still has some leaks in it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Freshwater Rescue Plan&lt;/a&gt;, a set of seven steps to clean up New Zealand’s rivers, lakes and groundwater was launched yesterday by experts and leaders from the tourism, science, public health, recreational and environmental protection sectors.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour’s 2017 water policy has been assessed against the 7 steps and, while it is performing well on some, their approach has been found lacking on others.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour’s commitment to stricter freshwater regulation, enforcement and monitoring was applauded as was their inclusion of limits for two major pollutants in its freshwater policy, phosphorous and sediment, which have been completely left out of National’s policy, and their focus on swimmable rivers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;However, the organisations would like to see more detail on the exact standards Labour is suggesting for major pollutants particularly faecal contamination (measured by E.coli), nitrogen, phosphorous as these can undermine the health of waterways and risk human health. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour has also committed to ensuring that increases in the intensity of land use for livestock would now need a resource consent. While this is a step in the right direction a more explicit commitment to decrease the national dairy herd is needed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is understood that Labour will be releasing a separate water allocation policy in which the issue of irrigation will be addressed.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is an absolute bottom line for our freshwater that political parties commit to stopping all public subsidies to irrigation and we need to see this reflected in Labour’s upcoming allocation policy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We also need to see a robust plan from Labour to lead and fund the transition away from irrigated intensive dairying towards diversified, clean and resilient agriculture and we hope to see this addressed in their primary industries policy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour has not yet indicated that they will implement a polluter pays system. Currently, the cost of pollution is largely paid by the public. We need central government to make polluters accountable by having them wear the costs. We hope to see a polluter pays system reflected in Labour’s overall environment policy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The final step in the Freshwater Rescue Plan is to adopt the OECD recommendation to transition New Zealand to a low carbon, greener economy.  The organisations hope to see this point addressed by Labour before the election.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Any prospective Government that is serious about stopping the decline of our freshwater systems and restoring health to our waterways does need to take all the steps outlined in the freshwater rescue plan to succeed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour’s new policy is a step in the right direction. But it still has some way to go before it will ensure that our river quality doesn’t continue to decline. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We hope that as Labour’s other policies are announced this year we see them commit to taking all of the steps outlined Freshwater Rescue Plan.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The organisations behind the Freshwater Rescue plan say they welcome the opportunity to meet with Labour, and all other parties, to discuss the importance of each of the seven steps in the plan and gain a commitment to implementing all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on DairyNZ and other dairy leadership to stop undermining the efforts of dairy farmers to clean up waterways.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, DairyNZ released a three-year report that outlined the mitigation work being done by farmers to minimise the fresh water pollution caused by dairy leaching and runoff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Greenpeace campaigner, Genevieve Toop, says the report is a “misleading distraction” from the real problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All the hard work being done by existing dairy farmers to deal with pollution is set to be cancelled out by the huge amount of new intensive dairy farms that will be created under proposed irrigation schemes,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our waterways are already not able to cope with the sheer number of dairy cows in New Zealand.  We urgently need to reduce the national herd number and stop big irrigation schemes like the Ruataniwha Dam.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Until DairyNZ is honest with the public and farmers about the fact that the only way to get clean water is to have fewer cows, they will continue to completely undermine dairy farmers’ mitigation efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This latest report shows the dairy leadership may have managed to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic, but the ship is still sinking thanks to big irrigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 75,000 New Zealanders have signed a &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=49911"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; to stop Government funding of irrigation schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

	A Government report leaked to Greenpeace shows the public is being misled over the effectiveness of video cameras used to police the fishing industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A Ministry of Primary Industries internal document says the new surveillance cameras installed on commercial fishing boats aren’t up to the task of checking on snapper size.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Under the law commercial fishers are allowed to discard snapper smaller than 25 cm in length. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The MPI and its Minister, Nathan Guy, previously went on record saying the video cameras can be used to make sure fishing fleets are legally compliant, and when they are not, footage can be used to prosecute the fishing companies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;However the report obtained by Greenpeace directly contradicts this claim. It says the camera footage is not up to standard for compliance and cannot be used as evidence for prosecutions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This is yet another blow to the credibility of MPI as a fishing regulator,” says Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The MPI report states the cameras cannot accurately measure the exact size of the snapper says Dr Norman. They’re not fit for purpose.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This means they won’t be any use in many court actions over fish dumping by commercial fishers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It’s a shambles. The Minister and the Government have claimed that video monitoring will solve the widespread practice of illegal fish dumping in the commercial trawl industry.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Yet all this time MPI have been sitting on a report by their own scientists which makes it clear that the video evidence isn't good enough for a successful prosecution.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“There is a simple solution to the fish dumping problem - make commercial fishers land every fish they catch. That way no fish are wasted, we incentivise onshore value adding and processing, and the video evidence can tell if the fish are dumped.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This approach is backed by the scientists commissioned by MPI to write the report.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace believes it’s time for a wide-ranging inquiry into the relationship between MPI’s fisheries section and the commercial fishing industry. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A full copy of the leaked report is available at: &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/mpi_report" target="_blank"&gt;http://greenpeace.nz/mpi_report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A New Zealander is among a group of activists who have halted a Statoil rig drilling in the Arctic.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Lizzie Sullivan, from Auckland, is with the protesters who paddled kayaks into the exclusion zone around Statoil’s oil rig, Songa Enabler in the Barents Sea. They deployed a large model planet Earth and attached it to the oil rig’s anchor chain. The globe carried written statements from people from all over the world, with a message to the Norwegian government to stop the oil drilling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their peaceful protest halted the operation of the oil rig for several hours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norwegian authorities have just now arrested the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The authorities unlawfully ended the activists’ peaceful protest against drilling in the Arctic with seizure of the ship and arrests of all 35 activists and crew members on board. The Arctic Sunrise is currently being towed away from the drilling site, to the mainland in Tromsö, Northern Norway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This follows an admission by Statoil that it paid private investigators in New Zealand to surveil Greenpeace staff over several years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activity is part of a widespread Greenpeace campaign against state-owned Norwegian oil giant Statoil’s oil exploration in the Arctic and in New Zealand waters. In 2016, the Norwegian Government granted new oil drilling licences in the Arctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sullivan, who is Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngati Tuwharetoa, says she joined the protest on board the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, because climate change is a global issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Both here in the Arctic and home in Aotearoa, Statoil are colluding with governments and are determined to suck out the last drops of oil, putting families, homes, and my people’s way of life on the line,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change is the biggest threat humanity faces and I can’t stand idly by whilst governments and corporations like Statoil collude to disrupt democracy and push our planet over the edge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re carrying messages from hundreds of thousands of people around the globe who are challenging Statoil’s activity. It’s the same back home in New Zealand, where thousands of Kiwis, including more than 80 hapu and iwi, have come together to say “no” to deep sea oil.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sullivan is the second Kiwi to join the ship in the Arctic on this trip. In July, New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless was also on board to confront Statoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up until recently, Statoil was also in New Zealand waters where it was prospecting for oil off the Wairarapa Coast using the world’s largest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the time, Greenpeace New Zealand used the crowdfunded boat, Taitu, to confront the Amazon Warrior, 50 nautical miles at sea.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Three swimmers, including Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, put themselves in the water in front of the 125-metre long ship, forcing it to change course and cease blasting for a day.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Both Greenpeace and the swimmers have been charged under the ‘Anadarko Amendment’ of the Crown Minerals Act. They will appear in Napier District Court on August 28.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Last week, Greenpeace New Zealand launched legal action against controversial spy agency, Thompson &amp;amp; Clark Investigations, after an investigation revealed that oil companies, including Statoil, hired the agency to spy on Greenpeace staff and volunteers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The information indicates that potentially hundreds of people had been watched, photographed and followed at work and at home on a daily basis, for several years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New Zealand Government has now also been implicated in the operation, and the Ministry of Business, Employment &amp;amp; Innovation (MBIE) admitted it received information from Thompson &amp;amp; Clark about Greenpeace while Statoil was using the Amazon Warrior to search for deep sea oil off the East Coast.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Four Greenpeace climbers are preparing to hang a large banner from a crane next to the Beehive to protest the arrival of US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who is in Wellington.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The action takes place days after the Trump Administration withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, causing global condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2017/BeehiveResistBanner/_47Q3313.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people are also expected to gather on Parliament lawn to “unwelcome” Tillerson, in a peaceful protest organised by climate group 350 Aotearoa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US Secretary of State is meeting New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English and Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says while world leaders have blasted the Trump administration’s isolationist stance on climate change, one of the few who has been notably silent is New Zealand Prime Minister, Bill English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If there was ever a time to show leadership, it is now. But instead, our Prime Minister is engaging with one of the world’s biggest climate deniers,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Before he started doing Trump’s dirty work, Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil, the oil company that systematically funded climate-denying propaganda and misinformation with the sole purpose of delaying global action on climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“English needs to choose what side of history he’s on when it comes to climate change – on the right side of history, or the Trump side of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the Trump administration tries desperately to keep the most destructive industries in the world alive, the New Zealand Government is doing pretty much the same – relying on carbon-intensive 1950s-style economic strategies that promote coal mining, oil drilling, fracking, road building, and dairy intensification.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The scariest part about this is that unlike the US, New Zealand’s clean energy sector is not thriving. In practice, New Zealand’s climate policy is actually worse than the States’ because our per-capita emissions are increasing at a greater rate.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Denying climate change and the rapid rise of clean energy is “desperate and futile”, says Simcock. The world is already making the transition at breakneck speed - renewables now make up more than half of the world’s new power capacity, and are growing by the day.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The world is moving forward without the US, which has now essentially surrendered any global leadership. We are witnessing a huge shift in the global order as places like Europe and China begin to lead the way forward. If New Zealand continues to align itself with Trump’s USA, we’re going to be left for dust,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is welcoming the farming leadership’s acknowledgement that the problem with our waterways is greater than previously admitted.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It is great that farming leaders are beginning to appreciate just how much New Zealanders care about their rivers,” says agricultural campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But this pledge, without a plan to back it up, could be seen as fairly meaningless. A cynical greenwash, a statement designed to allay the public’s concern without actually doing anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the farming leadership is serious, then luckily there is a plan all ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Freshwater Rescue Plan&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been signed up to by sixteen organisations and experts from across New Zealand society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan calls for a cut in cow numbers, an end to the $480 million crown irrigation fund, using that money instead to encourage and support regenerative agriculture. A sustainable way of farming that protects our land and waterways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The truth is, there are too many cows in New Zealand and it’s contaminating our rivers. Things are set to get worse with proposals to build massive, publically-funded irrigation schemes that will drive more intensive dairying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would be heartened to see the farming leadership back up their pledge by signing up to the Freshwater Rescue Plan and actually taking some substantive measures to reduce the effects of intensive dairying on our rivers.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s just-announced $950 million divestment from big polluters an “aha” moment for the country’s economy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says the Super Fund’s commercial decision to sell off almost $1 billion worth of investments in polluting companies due to the long-term risk climate change poses to the portfolio, sends a clear signal that there is no future in fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today’s announcement by the New Zealand Super Fund is a turning point for New Zealand, because they are recognising that fossil fuels are not financially viable,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand’s largest investment fund obviously got the memo before the National Government. Many of the companies the Super Fund has dumped including Statoil, Chevron, and Anadarko, are the very same companies that the Government insists on subsidising and supporting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This should be a wakeup call for a backward Government that refuses to accept the fact that if we don’t act urgently climate change will wreak havoc on everything, including the economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We need leaders who can make smart, innovative decisions that will benefit us in the long-term just as the Super Fund has just done, not a Government that panders to private interests in full knowledge of climate science in order to line the pockets of oil tycoons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s time to get the oil out of Government.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Super Fund has completely divested from oil companies including Statoil, Chevron and Anadarko, as well as the owner of Huntly coal-fired power station, Genesis Energy, and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, iwi and other groups have protested the presence of Statoil, Chevron and Anadarko in New Zealand waters for years. In April, Greenpeace protesters swam in front of a seismic ship Statoil had commissioned to search for deep sea oil.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Last week, Greenpeace revealed that it had been the target of a multi-year covert spy operation, ordered by oil companies, including Anadarko and Norwegian state-owned company, Statoil.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The environmental organisation was tipped off that the companies had contracted controversial spy agency, Thompson &amp;amp; Clark Investigations, to collect information about potentially hundreds of Greenpeace staff and volunteers, including following and watching people in their personal lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has launched legal action to protect the privacy of its staff and volunteers. This includes requesting an injunction to stop any ongoing surveillance, and launching a privacy claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New Zealand Government has now been implicated in the case and the Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Employment (MBIE) has admitted that its petroleum division did receive information from Thompson &amp;amp; Clark about Greenpeace while the Amazon Warrior was searching for oil in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	“Farming leadership and politicians are scaremongering by using false facts on water pricing proposals in their latest effort to keep the dairy industry free of accountability for polluted rivers,” says Greenpeace’s Senior Campaign Advisor Steve Abel.  

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newly released Labour Party policy would create a nominal charge on commercial water use for irrigation that would be a few cents per 1000 litres which would be returned to regional councils and iwi and used for cleaning up rivers.  Farming leadership and National Party politicians have exaggerated the figures and made false claims it would vastly increase the cost of food and send farmers to the wall.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Proposed water charges will not bankrupt rural communities.  It is big irrigation infrastructure which is locking farmers into massive intergenerational debt and effectively forcing them into dairy conversions such as in the Canterbury Plains.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The irrigation companies like Central Plains Water sign farmers into death-grip contracts forever where they must pay hundreds of dollars per-hectare per-year for water delivery infrastructure whether they use millions of litres, or even if they don’t use a single drop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s these brutal contracts that are putting farmers into massive debt and forcing them into greater intensification and expensive conversions from arable and sheep and beef into intensive dairying.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand's around 8,000 dairy farmers hold 38 billion dollars worth of debt and most of them do not irrigate.  Having to pay a tiny per-cubic-meter charge for the actual water they use will not bankrupt them, the broken industrial dairying model is already doing that”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And none of this money they currently pay is for the actual water itself.  The money goes to the irrigation company not to regional councils or Iwi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The cost of inputs for the industrial dairy farming system with chemical fertilisers, Palm Kernel and irrigation are what is hammering the farming community - keeping them in debt, forcing them into overstocking and leading to more pollution in our rivers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Regenerative farmers who are farming with fewer cows and less inputs are freeing themselves from these costs and helping to save our rivers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Most of the criticism of the Labour Party water pricing policy has been based on scaremongering around charges of up to 10 cents per litre for bottled water rather than the proposed few cents per 1000 litres for irrigation water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also important to note that most of New Zealand's food production is achieved without irrigation at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to the Government’s announcement that it will be setting up a new $400,000 scholarship programme for agricultural greenhouse gas research, Greenpeace sustainable agriculture campaigner, Genevieve Toop, says:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The Government’s $400,000 funding commitment to agricultural greenhouse gas research is pitiful compared to the $480 million it has set aside for big irrigation, which will increase the number of cows and our agricultural emissions to record levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The climate would be far better off if we got rid of 400,000 cows rather than spent $400,000 on more research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fewer cows is good for our climate and good for our rivers, yet that’s exactly what the National Government is refusing to commit to.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment released a report in 2016 on the options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The &lt;a href="http://www.pce.parliament.nz/publications/climate-change-and-agriculture-understanding-the-biological-greenhouse-gases" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found that as technology is not yet available, and the only sure way to decrease emissions from agriculture is to have less livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and the activists charged under the ‘Anadarko Amendment’ after swimming in front of the world’s largest seismic oil ship, have pleaded Not Guilty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, and activist Sara Howell, will be using a greater good defence to fight the charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says it was necessary to stop the Amazon Warrior searching for oil on behalf of Statoil and Chevron in order to protect people from climate change being driven by the oil industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By stopping this ship blasting our seafloor in search of new deep sea oil, we were stopping a far greater wrong - the destruction of our climate, and the risk to our marine life and coastal communities from a catastrophic oil spill,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change is no longer a faraway concept for future generations to deal with. It’s here and it’s threatening our survival. The extreme weather events that New Zealand has experienced in recent years are exactly the kinds of outcomes that we can expect in a warming world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Every single person and living thing on this planet will be affected by climate change. If we don’t take action now, one in six of the world’s &lt;a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6234/571" target="_blank"&gt;species face extinction&lt;/a&gt;, with the most at-risk species being here in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature14016.html" target="_blank"&gt;science says&lt;/a&gt; that if we are to have any chance of avoiding a climate catastrophe, we can’t afford to burn half of the fossil fuel reserves we know about, let alone search for more. The new oil Statoil has been searching for in New Zealand is the very oil that will drive us towards the edge if it is extracted and burnt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There has never been a more urgent time to act and stop the fossil fuel companies that are being allowed by governments to drive this destruction. For us to have a future, the oil industry must have no future.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April, Norman, Howell, and Gavin Mulvay, a kite-maker from Ashburton, were charged by the oil division of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE), for interfering with the Amazon Warrior. Greenpeace New Zealand has also been charged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The group had travelled more than 50 nautical miles out to the oil ship in the crowd-funded boat, Taitu, and put themselves in the water in its path, forcing it to stop seismic blasting for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the first time anyone has been charged under the 2013 Amendment to the Crown Minerals Act, dubbed the 'Anadarko Amendment', which was put in place specifically to stop protests at sea around oil exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trio were subsequently offered the possibility of diversion, but Norman and Howell have opted instead to fight the charges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says the decision to plead Not Guilty became more pertinent after recent revelations that controversial spy agency, Thompson &amp;amp; Clark Investigations, was hired by Statoil and Anadarko with the knowledge of the Government to undertake surveillance of Greenpeace staff and volunteers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Statoil has since admitted paying Thompson &amp;amp; Clark Investigations, and MBIE has also said it received information from the controversial spy agency - information it is using to prosecute the climate activists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says these admissions are just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The material we’ve seen shows our people have been watched every day, for years. They’ve been followed to their homes, they’ve been tailed in their personal time, they’ve had their privacy breached in completely unacceptable ways” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I have to fight these charges laid against us because we are in a climate emergency that’s being fuelled by the oil industry and propped up by our own Government. Politicians and industry are failing us, but people everywhere are rising up and taking action.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public opposition to the Amazon Warrior has seen protests in ports, petitions garnering tens of thousands of signatures, and significant iwi opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is welcoming the Green Party’s commitment to ban single-use plastic bags. 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greens say they’d make it happen in the first three years of Government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s a great first move on the way to eliminating single-use plastics,” says Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.  “But we’d like to see it happen much sooner.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Three years is a long time for marine animals to wait. Grocery bags are some of the worst offenders in the cocktail of plastics killing life in our waters”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an issue which New Zealanders care about dearly. Greenpeace wants the ban on bags to happen within 100 days of any new government.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are calling on all political parties vying for government to support a ban the bag position as a first step towards eliminating single-use plastics which pollute our oceans. Things like plastic bottles, straws, cutlery and bags kill sea-life like turtles, dolphins and seabirds. They break down into tiny pieces get eaten by fish and end up in our food.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turtle expert &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz/videos/10155595164280775/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr Dan Godoy from Massey University&lt;/a&gt; has found that one in three of the animals washed up on New Zealand shores have stomachs full of plastic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says the Greens are also proposing strategies for tackling the wider problem of plastic pollution and that is great to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In just a few weeks more than 27,000 New Zealanders have signed a &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/11481/petition/1?utm_source=greenpeace.org&amp;amp;utm_medium=bos&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oceans&amp;amp;utm_content=pr#firstPage/1"&gt;petition &lt;/a&gt;calling for an immediate ban on single-use plastic bags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two Australian supermarkets, Woolworths - a parent company of Countdown - and Coles, have pledged to stop giving single-use plastic bags to shoppers within the next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to the leaked Ministry for the Environment report that estimates $19 billion of property is at risk in New Zealand from the effects of climate change, Greenpeace climate campaigner Kate Simcock says:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This report shows that the Government is fully aware of the devastating effects climate change will have on our communities and our economy,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re talking about more than 130,000 people potentially being directly affected by sea level rise, flooding, and coastal erosion, almost 70,000 homes and buildings, and widespread damage to major infrastructure including roads, rail, and airports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The estimated $19 billion of property that’s at risk is phenomenal. To put it into context, it’s far greater than any single spending promise in the lead-up to the elections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is simply no bigger threat to the people of New Zealand, our environment, infrastructure, or economy than climate change - so the question is; why isn’t the National Government talking about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Three weeks out from the election and Bill English has been almost completely silent on the topic other than to say it’s not something that Kiwis wake up in the morning and think about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the background, his Government is continuing to push the expansion of oil, gas and coal to burn - the key driver of climate change - while burying reports like this that reveal the magnitude of the problem we face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was a key moment when Jacinda Ardern came out and compared climate change to her generation’s nuclear-free moment, but we’ve yet to see anything ambitious enough to tackle the seriousness of this problem in Labour's policies either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change must be the key issue for the election, and beyond. It’s an existential threat to all aspects of our society and way of life, and we need an all-of-government and all-of-society approach to tackle it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has just published a list of 11 things political parties should do now if they are serious about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/pdf/CH_Guide_Draft4-webversion.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The report can be downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is welcoming the Government’s latest announcement on microbeads as a good start.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The policy goes further than expected, widening the scope of banned products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new definition includes products such as body wash and toothpastes. It also includes anything that can be washed down stormwater drains, such as household cleaning products. However it doesn’t include makeup and that’s a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental organisation says the policy also falls short by not including “so-called” biodegradable microbeads, and nanoplastics, both potentially more toxic to marine life because of their minute size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace would encourage the Government to include these hazardous types of microbeads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows one in three turtles and thirty per cent of seabirds washed up dead on New Zealand’s shores have ingested single use plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the back of this announcement Greenpeace is calling on the Government to take the next obvious step and ban the biggest offender in the oceans - supermarket plastic bags.&lt;/p&gt;

	A law student from New Zealand is battling the country’s government in court this morning over a “failure” to properly address climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A win would potentially mean the New Zealand government will be forced to go back to the drawing board and come up with more ambitious climate targets. Along with similar lawsuits, it will set a bar for the type of action that developed countries must take to prevent dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; Sarah Thomson, 26, claims that as a developed country, New Zealand has an obligation under the Paris Agreement to set a target in line with the scientific consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So far the New Zealand government has shirked its responsibilities, set unambitious and irrational targets, and justified it all by saying we’re too small to make a difference,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Climate change is a global issue affecting us &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;here and now, and we all have a responsibility to act. Every year we’re experiencing more extreme weather events, including cyclones, droughts and floods, which are leaving entire communities devastated."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m young and I’m terrified of a time when I might have to look my kids in the eye and explain to them how we let this happen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thomson decided to launch the lawsuit after being inspired by global climate change litigation, including the 900 Dutch citizens who filed a case against the Dutch government, and a US case where 21 kids are taking on the Federal government and fossil fuel companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The litigation is the first of its kind in New Zealand and will be heard over the course of three days, starting from today, in the Wellington High Court[1]. The outcome of the case is not likely to be known for several months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand has helped organise a public mobilisation in support of Thomson, which is taking place this morning on the steps of the court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The case has the backing of several world-renowned climate change experts, including the “father of climate change awareness”, former NASA researcher, James Hansen, who is a witness for the case. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) author, Dr James Renwick, will also be giving evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the targets under review is New Zealand’s Paris Agreement commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 11% below 1990 levels by 2030. The lawsuit will ask the Minister for Climate Change Issues, currently Paula Bennett, to justify the way in which this target was set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her preliminary Statement of Defence, Bennett has denied that the New Zealand government needs to set a target that strengthens the global response to climate change to hold warming to “well below” 2c, with an aim of 1.5C, as stipulated by the Paris Agreement.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawyer Dennis van Berkel, who successfully argued the Dutch climate litigation case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in 2015 setting a global precedent, says he’ll be watching what happens in New Zealand with keen interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Dutch case proves that all governments have a legal duty to protect their citizens against climate change by doing their part to lower emissions,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Given the notoriously inadequate climate policies of New Zealand, this case may lead to the same conclusion. Global climate change litigation is growing, and all eyes are now on this hearing in this very important case.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New Zealand has the second-highest level of emissions per GDP unit in the OECD and the fifth-highest emissions per capita[2]. A recent Greenhouse Gas Inventory report confirmed that as of 2015, net emissions have increased by 63.6 per cent since 1990[3].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The New Zealand climate case is one of the many people-powered legal actions taking place around the world related to climate change. These include actions initiated by frontline communities in the Philippines, senior women in Switzerland, Indigenous Peoples in Canada, farmers from Peru and Pakistan, youth in Norway, Pakistan, Uganda, and the United States, and individuals and NGOs in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden.[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In each of these cases, people are using the power of the law because governments and fossil fuel companies are failing to protect and to respect human rights to a safe, stable climate and healthy environment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists are taking over Parliament lawn this lunchtime with a herd of dairy cows. They’re launching a new report which links the intensification of livestock farming with the safety of our drinking water.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The  animals will carry the message:  ‘Sick of Too Many Cows’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Too Many Cows" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2017/firstcows.jpg" alt="Too Many Cows" width="600" height="408"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report can be &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/sick-of-too-many-cows/"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s action is designed to send a message to the Government and opposition parties about the health implications of expanding intensive dairying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Scientists estimate that contaminated water causes between 18,000 and 34,000 cases of gastrointestinal illness in New Zealand each year, ” says Greenpeace Campaigner, Amanda Larsson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contaminated water increases the risk of getting sick from bacteria and other bugs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High nitrate concentrations in drinking water have been linked to blue baby syndrome and to some types of cancers, including colon and thyroid cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Not only is intensive livestock farming endangering the health of our rivers, but the latest science says there is a chance it may be putting our health at risk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling for a withdrawal of all public funding from big irrigation schemes, which are a major driver of dairy expansion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Contaminated drinking water is already making people ill. It’s a public health priority that the Government end state-sponsored irrigation schemes and implement strategies to decrease cow numbers immediately.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supporting the Greenpeace report will be Public Health Physician, Dr. Alistair Humphrey and spokesperson from the Public Health Association, Keriata Stuart. Both will be available for comment at the launch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Warren Lindberg from the Public Health Association says in his foreword to the Greenpeace report: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s no longer enough just to monitor the state of our water – the public health, environmental, tourism and industry sectors must start working together to stop the pollution in the first place.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grazing livestock are now considered to be the main source of faecal contamination of freshwater in New Zealand says Larsson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Where there is clear evidence of potential risk to human health, the Government has a responsibility to take the precautionary approach,” says Larsson.  “But right now, it’s doing the opposite.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“National has set aside nearly half a billion dollars for irrigation schemes which will increase water contamination by expanding and intensifying dairying.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government needs to put people’s health first. As a starting point, they must end public funding of big irrigation schemes like the Ruataniwha Dam in Hawke’s Bay and Central Plains Water Scheme in Canterbury.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is a key partner in the &lt;a href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Freshwater Rescue Plan&lt;/a&gt; launched earlier this month. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the demands is redirecting Government money from irrigation to an Agriculture Transition Fund to help farmers switch to more ecological forms of farming.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	This Greenpeace report examines the potential connections between livestock farming, water pollution and public health. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/554c41a2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px 7px;" title="Sick of Too Many Cows Report" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/Agriculture/CowsHealthReport.jpg" alt="Sick of Too Many Cows Report" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New research has heightened concerns that intensive livestock farming could increase risks to human health. In order to maintain a healthy population, we need to understand how livestock farming could affect our health. These risks must be carefully weighed, especially at a time when the Government is preparing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to expand the dairy industry through irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;

	What if?

Asks a new short film from Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;What if the solution for overcoming our freshwater crisis came from farmers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The very group bearing the brunt of the blame for the contamination of our waterways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace has been travelling New Zealand talking to farmers who’ve discovered better ways to farm. New techniques that are regenerating the environment and saving our rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The environmental organisation has created a short doco about these farmers entitled &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/theregenerators/"&gt;“The Regenerators.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Farming holds the key to saving our environment, cleaning up our rivers, locking away climate emissions and rebuilding biodiversity,” says Greenpeace agriculture campaigner Genevieve Toop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “All that is missing to make it happen is the support from farming leadership and the Government to help farmers make the transition.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Agriculture is New Zealand’s largest land-user. It is the country’s single biggest climate polluter and a major source of water contamination. It has also been a big player in the decline of our native species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But farmers are proving that regenerative methods can turn this dire situation around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “These farmers have gone so much further than just fencing off their streams, they’re looking at farming in a whole new way and we believe their models are the future of agriculture.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “By diversifying pastures and farm systems, building healthy soil, reducing costly and environmentally damaging inputs like chemical fertiliser and lowering stocking rates, farms can make profit and regenerate the environment” says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Despite Fonterra’s flashy ad’s, intensive dairying is losing its social licence because of the state of our rivers. Those problems are not going to go away so the farming leadership and the government need to pull finger and start taking regenerative farming seriously.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is calling on the Government to redirect 480 million dollars currently being used to finance big irrigation and more intensive dairying into a fund designed to support NZ farms to transition to regenerative agriculture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This demand is part of a the Freshwater Rescue Plan, a challenge laid down before political parties by coalition of other organisation and experts in launched in June of this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The farmers that are in our video have the strength to face up to the problems, and the bravery, creativity and determination to turn those problems into solutions. It’s time the Government and the farming leadership got in behind them.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A Greenpeace investigation has revealed the true extent of the powers that the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) has given the fishing industry to self-regulate and report on its own performance.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The months-long investigation shows that MPI is paying FishServe (Commercial Fisheries Services Ltd), a company controlled and owned by a powerful fishing industry lobby group, to collect data, manage so called “public registers”, register and unregister vessels, monitor overfishing and quota holdings, and even provide Official Information Act (OIA) responses in place of MPI.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The discovery comes on the back of the controversial revelation last May that MPI had awarded the contract for video camera monitoring of fishing vessels to Trident, an entity owned by several of New Zealand’s largest and most powerful fishing companies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the time, MPI was widely criticised for engaging the fox to guard the hen house.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says deeper digging has revealed that the Trident saga is “just the tip of the iceberg”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Last month we made an OIA request to MPI about fishing quota holdings. We were stunned when, despite the fact that MPI had access to the information we asked for, it instead referred us to a pay-to-subscribe service through the ‘public register’ of a company called FishServe,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“A closer look revealed that FishServe is in fact an entity owned and controlled by the fishing industry and is run out of the very same office that is home to not only Trident and Seafood New Zealand, but also other fishing industry lobby groups including Deepwater Group, Fisheries Inshore New Zealand and New Zealand Federation of Commercial Fishermen.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We have learnt that for more than 20 years MPI, or its predecessor the Ministry of Fisheries, have outsourced a broad range of powers, duties and responsibilities to FishServe.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This worrying web of connections raises serious questions about MPI’s outsourcing of camera monitoring and regulatory powers to vested interests.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Further muddying the waters, Seafood New Zealand’s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Pankhurst, is also one of four FishServe directors. MPI has allowed a Seafood New Zealand subsidiary to become a proxy regulator, and is paying them for the privilege, says Norman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We just don’t understand how FishServe, working alongside lobby groups and fishing industry owned companies on a daily basis, owned and controlled by a powerful industry lobby group, can be allowed to act as proxy ‘regulator’,” Norman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What this means in practice is that, in order to prosecute fishing companies for legal breaches, the government regulator, MPI, has to rely on data collected and provided by a company owned by the fishing companies themselves, FishServe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is a classic example of regulatory capture - where an industry controls the government regulator that is supposed to be controlling the industry.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace investigation was initially launched in response to MPI’s controversial decision to award the contract for video monitoring in New Zealand’s largest fishery, Snapper 1, to Trident.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not only is Trident owned by several of New Zealand’s most powerful fishing companies, but it’s also a relative newcomer that was chosen over the only other competitor, Archipelago, an independent and internationally respected fisheries monitoring company.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“At the time we already had serious concerns around MPI’s repeated failure to prosecute large fishing companies for the dumping and discarding of fish, and the decision to award the video monitoring contract to Trident was even more troubling - it left the impression that MPI had chosen to have the fox guard the hen house,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Late last year, it was widely reported that the first few months of Trident’s camera monitoring programme had a camera failure rate of almost 80%. MPI called the failures “technical issues”. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says the failures were hardly surprising given Trident’s relative inexperience, but raised further concerns about MPI’s decision to award the contract to Trident in the first place.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“As a result, Greenpeace has continued to investigate MPI’s relationship with the fishing industry, and it’s safe to say that what has emerged since is a complex and highly concerning web of relationships, suggestive of a cosy relationship between MPI and New Zealand’s fishing industry,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This is something that at the very least warrants further investigation and we’ll be looking to refer this to the Auditor General for review.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Hawke’s Bay Regional Council appears to have hammered the last nail in the coffin of the Ruataniwha Irrigation Dam.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Late yesterday it announced that the only option left on the table to keep the scheme alive will not be pursued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Councillors &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1707/S00310/council-committee-seeks-advice-on-ruataniwha-scheme.htm" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that they will not be using the Public Works Act to grab the land needed to make the dam a reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That was the only avenue remaining for the Government and Regional Council to push through a big irrigation project that so many people didn’t want,” says Greenpeace Agriculture Campaigner, Gen Toop. “The dam is effectively dead in the water.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Regional Council have set aside 80 million dollars to fund the scheme&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This follows a ruling by the Supreme Court last week that the area of conservation land cannot have its protected status revoked to make way for the dam.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local Iwi Ngati Kahungunu, Forest and Bird, Greenpeace and hundreds of local community members have all opposed the proposed dam over environmental issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Ruataniwha Dam was the poster child of the Government’s think-big irrigation agenda,  which is now very clearly flailing and needs to be put down.” says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the wake of Ruataniwha, Greenpeace is issuing a warning to other think-big irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The demise of the  Ruataniwha irrigation dam sends one clear message to other proposed irrigation schemes around the country: Their days are numbered.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dam would have driven land conversions to intensive dairying and further river pollution. As a result it has faced monumental opposition across the board, both locally and nationally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 90,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the Government stops funding big irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dam has faced several &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/agribusiness/81584871/protestors-take-antiruataniwha-dam-message-to-council-chambers"&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=11633174"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; protests, including in September last year when Greenpeace &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=11708836"&gt;returned the proposed dam’s site office&lt;/a&gt; from near where the dam was planned back to the Council. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key investors have also walked away from the dam, it’s faced a lengthy consent process and a court battle which it ultimately lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last October, the people of Hawke’s Bay made their opposition to the dam clear when they voted out the pro-dam majority council and elected in an anti-dam council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Ruataniwha dam would have meant more industrial dairying and more pollution in our rivers so this is a victory for our rivers and for the thousands of people that opposed the dam,” says Toop.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The huge public opposition which has resulted in the dam’s demise is a stark warning to the other large irrigation schemes planned, like Central Plains Water and Hunter Downs in Canterbury.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is demanding the Government's  irrigation subsidies be spent on a transition fund to more sustainable forms of farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environmental organisation is releasing a short documentary today, starring NZ farmers, called The Regenerators: A better way to farm.&lt;/p&gt;

	The campaign for better water quality is continuing to gather support, with organisations representing half a million members and supporters now backing the recently launched Freshwater Rescue Plan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Support has been boosted with eight new organisations giving their backing to the Plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The new supporters are ActionStation, Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand (ECO), New Zealand Federation of Freshwater Anglers, New Zealand Recreation Association, Pure Advantage, Waitaha Executive Grandmothers Council, Whitewater New Zealand, and WWF – New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Their support means the Plan’s backers now include 16 well-known organisations with collective support from at least half a million people. Supporters include leaders in the science, public health, tourism, recreation, community, and environmental sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The original supporters of the Freshwater Rescue Plan are Choose Clean Water, Federated Mountain Clubs of New Zealand Inc., Fish &amp;amp; Game New Zealand, Forest &amp;amp; Bird, Greenpeace New Zealand, OraTaiao - New Zealand Climate &amp;amp; Health Council, the Public Health Association, and the Tourism Export Council of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Freshwater Rescue Plan was launched in Wellington last month in reaction to the Government’s disappointing ‘Clean Water Package’, which has been widely criticized for being complicated, confusing, lacking urgency and weakening protection for freshwater ecosystems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Freshwater Rescue Plan provides seven achievable steps for the Government to protect the health of New Zealand’s people, wildlife, and waterways. Supporters say it is a sensible and realistic strategy to rescue New Zealand’s rivers, lakes and streams from their present, dangerously unhealthy state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fresh water is now one of the most important issues facing New Zealanders this election year and pressure is building on political parties to support the Rescue Plan to reverse the decline in freshwater quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Rescue Plan’s supporters want all political parties to face up to their environmental responsibility and adopt the entire plan into their policies. The supporters are disappointed with the government’s response, saying it has rejected the plan and ignored requests for meetings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The organisations backing the Freshwater Rescue Plan are repeating their offer to meet with the government and work with it to achieve the plan’s goals which will benefit all New Zealanders’ environment, health and economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The plan’s supporters say the health of people and wildlife is suffering from widespread freshwater pollution and are calling on the government to show it is taking the degraded state of our rivers and lakes seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Freshwater Rescue Plan’s steps include setting strict and enforceable water quality standards based on human health and ecosystems health limits, withdrawing public subsidies of irrigation schemes, supporting sustainable agricultural practices, and decreasing cow numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The plan also calls for better water quality reporting, a polluter pays system, and a long-term goal of prioritising a low-carbon economy for New Zealand. If all seven steps of the Freshwater Rescue Plan are enacted, fresh water in Aotearoa can return to the once pristine state that New Zealand is known for. For more information – &lt;a title="Freshwater Rescue Plan" href="http://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;head to the website here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seven steps of the Freshwater Rescue Plan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritise the health of people and their waterways by setting strict and enforceable water quality standards, based on human and ecosystem health limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdraw all public subsidies of irrigation schemes, as they increase pressure on waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in an Agricultural Transition Fund, to support the country's shift away from environmentally-damaging farming methods by redirecting $480 million of public money earmarked for irrigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strategies to decrease cow numbers immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce freshwater contamination by instigating polluter pays systems nationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address the performance of regional council’s on improving water quality through quarterly reports from the Ministry for the Environment on enforcement, breaches and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt OECD recommendation to establish a whole-of-government, multi-stakeholder process to develop a long-term vision for the transition of New Zealand to a low-carbon, greener economy.&lt;/li&gt;

	Barents Sea, Norway -  11 peaceful activists from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise have taken to the water in inflatable boats to oppose the Statoil Songa Enabler oil rig, 275 km North off the Norwegian coast, in the Arctic Barents sea.
 

 
 
 
 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They hold banners that say: “People Vs. Arctic Oil” directed at Statoil and the Norwegian government, which has opened a new, aggressive search for oil in the waters of the Barents Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

Sustento wants the Norwegian government to take responsibility for its climate commitments and development of a new oil frontier in the Arctic. She lost her entire family, except for her brother, to Super-typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which left large parts of her hometown, Tacloban, in ruins. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It is hard for me to grasp and accept that a government like Norway’s is opening up new Arctic oil drilling, knowing full well it will put families and homes in other parts of the world at risk. I’m here in the Arctic to see this irresponsibility with my own eyes; share my story about the human consequences of climate change; and call on the Norwegian government to put a stop to this dangerous search for new oil,” said Sustento.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just two weeks after signing the Paris Climate Agreement, the Norwegian Government awarded 13 oil companies 10 new licenses in a completely new area, for the first time in more than 20 years.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It is scary to think that super-typhoons could become the new normal if governments like Norway’s allow more oil drilling. I couldn't stop the typhoon that destroyed my home, but Norway could play a role in curbing the severity and frequency of these storms right now. It gives me hope to see that right now people are taking peaceful action for the climate all over the world and holding governments accountable,” added Sustento.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace and the Norwegian organisation Nature and Youth, have also filed a lawsuit against the Norwegian government, arguing that the new oil licenses violate both the Paris Climate Agreement and paragraph 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which commits the government “to safeguard the people’s right to a clean and healthy environment for future generations.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than 250,000 people have added their names to support the climate lawsuit, and these witness statements will be used to support the case in court.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“I can’t stand by, doing nothing, when we know beyond a doubt that we can’t burn a single barrel of oil from a new well if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe. I don’t ever want to look my kids in the eye and explain why I didn’t do all I could to protect them from climate change. It is beyond my understanding that the Norwegian government is giving Statoil a ticket to drill like mad at the expense of future generations,” said Lucy Lawless.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“For me it’s more than a case of ‘not in our own backyard’. Climate change is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. The companies driving it must be pursued and stopped - we will confront them in every corner of the world,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“New Zealand is my homeland. I cannot stand by as big oil companies come in to drill against all our best interests. The age of oil must end.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Up until last month, the state-owned Norwegian Statoil was in New Zealand waters where it was prospecting for oil off the Wairarapa Coast using the world’s largest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;During this time Lawless helped Greenpeace crowdfund for a boat, named Taitu, which the environmental organisation used to confront the Amazon Warrior at sea, stopping it from seismic blasting for a period of time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Three swimmers, including Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Dr Russel Norman, travelled more than 50 nautical miles off the Wairarapa Coast in the crowdfunded boat, Taitu, in search of the Amazon Warrior, which has been blasting for oil on behalf of Statoil.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman and two others then put themselves in the water in front of the 125-metre long ship, forcing it to change course and cease blasting for a day.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Both Greenpeace and the three swimmers have been charged under the ‘Anadarko Amendment’ of the Crown Minerals Act. It’s the first time anyone has been charged under the controversial law, which was passed in 2013 without public consultation, and is designed stop protest against oil ships at sea.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The activists face jail time and, along with Greenpeace, face large fines.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Statoil rig Songa Enabler is currently looking for new oil at the Gemini North license, and is expected to continue to the Korpfjell license later this summer. Both licenses were awarded in the 23rd licensing round that is subject of the court case filed by Greenpeace and Nature and Youth, scheduled for hearing on November 14th, 2017. Statoil and the Norwegian government have decided to go ahead with the drillings despite the legal dispute.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Photos from the protest here: &lt;a href="http://act.gp/2uhXYjm"&gt;http://act.gp/2uhXYjm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;More information about the case against the Norwegian government: &lt;a href="http://act.gp/2vrIny4"&gt;http://act.gp/2vrIny4&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has launched its crowdfunded boat ‘Taitu’ this morning from Napier and is heading out to confront the world’s biggest seismic blasting ship.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Trump-backed oil giant Chevron and arctic driller Statoil are using the 125-metre long Amazon Warrior, dubbed “The Beast”, to search for oil off the Wairarapa Coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand crowdfunded nearly $100,000 in just seven days to buy the newest member of its fleet, &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/taitu-live"&gt;the 15-metre Taitu&lt;/a&gt;, and then crowdsourced its name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says people across New Zealand are rising up against the pursuit of new oil to burn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In New Zealand we’ve been inundated with a deluge of extreme storms, flooding, droughts and fires in the space of just a couple of months, and it’s only April. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Victoria University climate scientist, Professor James Renwick, has just come out and said the devastating floods, which have seen thousands evacuated from their homes, are connected to climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change makes extreme weather events worse. It threatens our homes, health and families, and the science is clear - if we want a stable climate for us and our kids, we can’t burn even half the fossil fuel reserves that have already been discovered (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This means not a single new oil well, gas field or coal mine can operate anywhere if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Despite knowing this, our Government is actively subsidising oil companies to look for new oil, putting profits above people’s lives. And this is all while Prime Minister Bill English is visiting families in Edgecumbe who’ve lost everything in the floods. It’s deplorable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taitu’s trip follows on from a flotilla that included Ngāti Kahungunu’s voyaging waka Te Matau a Maui, which travelled out to the Amazon Warrior to deliver a message on behalf of more than 80 hapū of Te Ikaroa.  This is the third warning delivered to the ship by Te Ikaroa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Amazon Warrior has been searching for oil off the Wairarapa Coast since last November. This involves blasting the seafloor, every eight seconds, day and night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ship is commissioned by Statoil and Chevron, who have permits to drill to extreme depths of up to three kilometres if oil is found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fossil Fuel President, Donald Trump, has shares in Chevron, and the oil company funded a large part of his presidential inauguration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public opposition to the oil exploration has seen protests in ports, petitions garnering tens of thousands of signatures, and significant local council and iwi opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In January, Greenpeace and East Coast group, Te Ikaroa, travelled nearly 50 nautical miles in small inflatables to confront the ship and deliver messages signed by almost 80,000 New Zealanders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says this time it’s important to take more people out to sea, stay out there for longer, and to do it in a people-powered boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hope exists in people standing together and demanding change. When we stand together, we always win,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says today’s court decision over the Ruataniwha Dam is a major victory in the struggle against big irrigation and the nationwide intensification of dairying.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today the Supreme Court has held that an area of conservation land cannot have its protected status revoked to make way for the Ruataniwha irrigation dam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Government tried to appeal an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal which in effect meant the land could not be flooded. Today it failed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dam would have driven land conversions to intensive dairying and further river pollution. It has faced huge opposition locally and nationally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Ruataniwha dam would have meant more industrial dairying and more pollution in our rivers so today’s court ruling is also a win for our rivers,” says Greenpeace Campaigner, Gen Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Conservation land belongs to all New Zealanders, not to companies wanting to destroy it for private profit. " she says. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“If the court had allowed the Government to carry out its destructive plans for the Ruataniwha Dam, it would have set a dangerous precedent for New Zealand’s conservation estate had Forest and Bird not stepped up to challenge the Government’s plans.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It also sends a clear message to other irrigation projects around the country,” says Toop. “They will be challenged.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several large irrigation schemes planned being subsidised by the government’s $480 million irrigation fund, like Central Plains Water and Hunter Downs in Canterbury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 90,000 people have signed a petition demanding the Government stops funding big irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that those irrigation subsidies be spent on a transition fund to more sustainable forms of farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environmental organisation is crowdfunding  to release a new hard hitting TV ad warning people about the risks of intensive dairying and big irrigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last controversial ad attracted complaints from Dairy NZ but they were thrown out by the Advertising Standards Authority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand has today launched a new educational website about the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, which includes a series of never-seen-before documents.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="Rainbow Warrior resource" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/about/history/The-bombing-of-the-Rainbow-Warrior-/" target="_blank"&gt;educational portal&lt;/a&gt; contains a &lt;a href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/NZSIS%20declassified%20file.pdf"&gt;recently declassified Security Intelligence Service briefing &lt;/a&gt;and some internal Greenpeace archival material. New material will be added over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has made them public on the eve of the anniversary of the 1985 bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour, which was carried out by the French Secret Service, and killed Greenpeace photographer, Fernando Pereira.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been working in collaboration with teachers to build the website in an effort to bring the story of the Rainbow Warrior to classrooms around the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says the lessons learnt from the bombing and the nuclear free campaign are just as important as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing is also a reminder of how effective people power can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The bombing was intended to shut down Greenpeace’s Nuclear Free Pacific campaign, but what it actually did was bring people together throughout the country to take a stand against the world’s nuclear superpowers. And people power ended French nuclear testing in the Pacific,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve now also just marked the 30th anniversary of New Zealand’s Nuclear Free Zone status - a feat of which we can be incredibly proud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As we face the two largest existential threats to human survival - climate change and nuclear weapons – I think we can take heart from the fact that when we stand together, we can beat anything.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is particularly important today as we confront the New Zealand Government working in collusion with the oil industry to stop peaceful protest about climate change. Just recently, a group of peaceful protesters, including myself, were prosecuted for putting ourselves in the water in front of the world’s largest seismic ship to stop it from searching for the new oil we know will destroy our climate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We were charged by the Government’s oil division under the Anadarko Amendment - legislation that was rushed through in 2013 without any public consultation to shield oil companies from peaceful protest in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The spirit of the original Rainbow Warrior is still strong in Greenpeace and, working alongside millions of others, we will defeat the oil industry and the Governments it employs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recently declassified Security Intelligence Service briefing &lt;a title="Declassified files NZSIS" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/NZSIS%20declassified%20file.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;can be seen here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Thursday, 13 April: As the country braces for Cyclone Cook, the latest and the most devastating in a series of extreme weather events, Greenpeace NZ has slammed Prime Minister Bill English for crying “crocodile tears”.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Kate Simcock, says it’s “disgraceful” that the Prime Minister has visited the communities and families affected by extreme flooding at the very same time as actively encouraging oil exploration off New Zealand’s coasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Government is relentless in their search for new oil, even in the knowledge that we can’t burn half the fossil fuel reserves already discovered if we have any hope of stopping catastrophic climate change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This simple fact means that not a single new oil well can operate anywhere in the world, including New Zealand, for us to have a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Climate change is hitting us hard and it’s hitting New Zealanders now. It’s only April, and we’ve already been inundated with a deluge of extreme storms, flooding, droughts and fires. People across the country are losing their homes. We’re in dire straits - the situation has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s disgraceful that Bill English is visiting the communities reeling from these terrible storms in a so-called show of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s crying crocodile tears, because there is no other explanation for the continued search for new oil other than a desire to put profit before people. The only jobs the oil industry is creating are in flood clean up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Victoria University climate scientist, Professor James Renwick, said the floods, which saw thousands evacuated from their homes, are connected to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the crowdfunded Greenpeace boat, Taitu, returned from a three-day protest, 50 nautical miles out to sea, where the world’s biggest seismic blasting ship, the Amazon Warrior, is searching for new oil at extreme depths off the Wairarapa Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest saw three activists, including Greenpeace NZ Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, throwing themselves in the water in front of the ship, forcing it to halt its operations.&lt;br&gt;For the first time in New Zealand history, the protestors have been charged with interfering with the oil exploration ship under Section 101B(1)(c) of the Crown Minerals Act, known as the Anadarko Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio were served the charges not by the police, but by MBIE – the petroleum division of the Government. They face fines of up to $50,000 and 12 months in prison if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simcock says this very fact demonstrates the Government is prioritising protecting the oil industry over acting in the best interests the citizens it’s supposed to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a huge red flag that rather than investing in a transition to renewable energy, the English-led Government is putting time and resources into prosecuting peaceful protestors and diminishing the right to protest in New Zealand by calling it a ‘stupid media stunt’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a clear sign we are dealing with a Government that’s captured by industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But public opposition to the oil exploration in New Zealand is snowballing. This year we’ve already seen protests in ports, petitions garnering tens of thousands of signatures, and significant local council and iwi opposition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg. A new era of protest and climate justice has begun. People everywhere are rising up to change the course of the most significant fight in human history - climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The current Government should prepare for a battering of its oil agenda. We need to make sure that after the elections in September, the dinosaurs that currently run it are left behind in the wrong side of history, where they belong.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says it’s time the Government woke up to its own advice on freshwater and stopped making matters worse.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmental organisation is accusing Prime Minister Bill English of only pretending to care about New Zealand’s rivers - then pumping more money into agricultural irrigation - which has been shown to aggravate freshwater pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Ministry for the Environment released a report on the state of our waterways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes for sobering reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report states that New Zealand has experienced one of the world’s highest rates of agricultural land intensification over recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen pollution is getting worse at more than half of the rivers monitored in New Zealand.  Leaching of this pollutant from agricultural soils has increased 29 percent between 1990 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen pollution degrades waterway health and at very high concentrations makes water dangerous for people to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace campaigner Genevieve Toop says: “This report outlines what many others have done before it, that New Zealand's once pristine freshwater is now in crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of tackling this human and environmental health issue the Government is using taxpayers’ money to cause even more devastation to our waterways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has set aside $480 million to subsidise irrigation schemes through its Irrigation Acceleration Fund, and Crown Irrigation Investments Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government is incentivising huge irrigation schemes which will be used to run more dairy cows. More cows mean more water pollution”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Industrial dairying and freshwater are on a head-on collision course and Government-funded irrigation schemes are accelerating the crash.” says Toop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also shows that freshwater pollution in urban catchments also needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it noted that urban land covers less than 1 percent of New Zealand, while pastoral land covers about 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report from the OECD released last month advised the Government to review its support for irrigation stating that their “financial support to irrigation projects indirectly encourages intensification of agriculture, which is likely to further increase pressures on freshwater resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the OECD’s warning the Prime Minister went to Canterbury last week to cut the ribbon on stage two of an enormous irrigation scheme.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Plains Irrigation scheme will expand intensive dairying and it’s predicted to leach hundreds of tonnes of nitrogen into the already polluted waterways in Canterbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stage one of this foolhardy scheme was originally opened by former PM John Key two years before. It shows that despite a rising tide of public concern the Government is pressing ahead with its plans to sacrifice our rivers for more industrial dairying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any Government which was serious about responding to the freshwater crisis would immediately scrap the irrigation fund and reduce the dairy herd.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists have thrown themselves into the sea in front of a huge offshore oil exploration vessel off the New Zealand coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Among them is Greenpeace Executive Director, Russel Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The swimmers’ position has forced the oil exploration ship to halt its operations and deviate off course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This drama is taking place 50 nautical miles off the Wairarapa coast where the 125 metre Amazon Warrior, nicknamed “The Beast” is seismic blasting for oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oil exploration is being carried out for Arctic driller Statoil and Chevron, a US oil company part-owned by President Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find oil, the Amazon Warrior is using seismic cannons to blast the seafloor with sound waves every eight seconds, day and night. It needs to travel in straight lines along a grid to get data about potential oil reserves, and any deviation makes this data unusable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blasts it lets off are comparable in sound to an underwater volcano and can cause chronic distress to whales and dolphins in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Statoil and Chevron have permits to drill to extreme depths of up to three kilometres if oil is found – twice as deep as Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which caused the world’s largest and most devastating oil spill in 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fossil Fuel President, Donald Trump, has shares in Chevron, and the oil company funded a large part of his presidential inauguration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;25-year-old, Sara is another of the swimmers currently floating in the path of the Amazon Warrior with Russel Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She says she’s putting her body on the line because the ship is searching for the very oil that will destroy her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The science is settled that we can’t burn the majority of the fossil fuel reserves we know about if we want to keep the Earth’s temperature below dangerous levels,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What this means is that not a single newly discovered oil well anywhere in the world can operate if we want to avoid a climate catastrophe. Right now I’m looking at a ship that’s been invited here by the New Zealand Government to do just that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’m young and I’m already experiencing the effects of climate change. Every year the storms get worse, the floods and the droughts are getting more extreme. Just imagine how grim my future looks if we can’t stop this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s easy to feel powerless because what we’re up against is so big. But everywhere, people are rising up and demanding change. Their actions are having a snowball effect, and in many parts of the world, we’re starting to see huge, positive changes.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been tailing the Amazon Warrior for the past 2 days in its newest boat, Taitu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The organisation crowdfunded nearly $100,000 in just a week to buy the 15-metre boat, and ran an online competition to choose its name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2013 Amendment to the Crown Minerals Act, dubbed the 'Anadarko Amendment', was put in place to stop protests at sea around oil exploration. The law change makes it an offence to interfere with or get closer than 500 metres of an offshore ship involved in oil exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From on board Taitu, Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says the right to peaceful protest is essential to a healthy democracy and New Zealand has a long and proud tradition of protest at sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Neither the Government nor the oil industry can stifle people across New Zealand peacefully rising up against this mad pursuit of new oil to burn in the midst of what is nothing less than a climate emergency,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change threatens our homes, health and families. Despite knowing this, our Government is actively subsidising oil companies to look for new oil, putting profits above people’s lives - it has become necessary for people to take action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In New Zealand we’ve already seen extreme storms, flooding, drought and fires in the space of a just a few weeks, and it’s only April. Climate change makes these weather events more frequent and more intense.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taitu’s trip follows on from a flotilla that included Ngāti Kahungunu’s voyaging waka, Te Matau a Māui, which travelled out to the Amazon Warrior to deliver a message on behalf of more than 80 hapū of Te Ikaroa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public opposition to oil exploration has seen protests in ports, petitions garnering tens of thousands of signatures, and significant local government and iwi opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is warning of more Havelock North’s if New Zealand doesn't start managing the intersection between industrial agriculture and water.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today, the Government revealed the preliminary results of an inquiry into the contamination which made 5,500 Hawke’s Bay people sick.  The infected drinking water contributed to the deaths of three others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report puts the likely blame on sheep faeces getting into a bore used for drinking water after heavy rain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The science suggests this is going to happen again if the latest health reports are anything to go by,” says Greenpeace campaigner, Amanda Larsson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty per cent of New Zealanders rely on groundwater for drinking. Concerned about the growing incidence of animal borne diseases, Greenpeace has been preparing its own report on the problem of water contamination from industrial agriculture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says the initial research indicates that Canterbury is one of the most likely places for another outbreak. That’s due to the proliferation of intensive dairy farming on leaky soils.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand has one of the highest rates of animal borne diseases in the developed world. Notified cases are high compared to Australia, the UK, Germany and the USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A strong correlation is emerging between increasing incidences of gastrointestinal illnesses and the rapid growth of intensive dairy farming over the last two decades,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s also fitting that on the very same day in Hawke’s Bay, a review on the Ruataniwha irrigation dam was also presented down the road in Napier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These two issues are related: There is now a very clear link between the growth of intensive livestock production and increased pollution of rivers and lakes.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Irrigation schemes such as these are underpinning the expansion of industrial agriculture and intensive dairying in particular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government and regional councils need to wake up to the fact that these things are all linked,” Larsson says. “Irrigation leads to more intensive livestock farming, which leads to sick rivers and sick people.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Government and the farming industry need to look at more sustainable, less intensive ways of farming that reduce effects on waterways and public health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless has just set sail on the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, to confront the Norwegian oil giant Statoil as it drills for oil in the Arctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Up until last month, the state-owned Norwegian company was in New Zealand waters where it was prospecting for oil off the Wairarapa Coast using the world’s largest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During this time Lawless helped Greenpeace crowdfund for a boat, named Taitu, which the environmental organisation used to confront the Amazon Warrior at sea, stopping it from seismic blasting for a period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is now following Statoil across the globe and will spend just over a week in the Arctic with a team of climate activists, tailing the company as it drills for oil in one of the most pristine parts of the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Norwegian Government is opening up a new oil frontier in the Arctic, the northernmost for 20 years, and Statoil will drill up to seven wells there this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In November, Greenpeace and the Norwegian organisation, Nature &amp;amp; Youth, will take the Government to court, arguing that it is violating The Paris Agreement and the Norwegian Constitution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawless says climate change is a global issue and the fossil fuels companies that drive it must be challenged wherever they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She will be updating people on her journey over social media as it unfolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For me it’s more than a case of ‘not in our own backyard’. Climate change is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. The companies driving it must be pursued and stopped - we will confront them in every corner of the world,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand is my homeland. I cannot stand by as big oil companies come in to drill against all our best interests. The age of oil must end.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Arctic trip follows on from Greenpeace’s at-sea action against Statoil in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three swimmers, including Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Dr Russel Norman, travelled more than 50 nautical miles off the Wairarapa Coast in the crowdfunded boat, Taitu, in search of the Amazon Warrior, which has been blasting for oil on behalf of Statoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman and two others then put themselves in the water in front of the 125-metre long ship, forcing it to change course and cease blasting for a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Greenpeace and the three swimmers have been charged under the ‘Anadarko Amendment’ of the Crown Minerals Act. It’s the first time anyone has been charged under the controversial law, which was passed in 2013 without public consultation, and is designed stop protest against oil ships at sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists face jail time and, along with Greenpeace, face large fines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz/videos/10155133821903300/" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the Facebook Live video of Lucy Lawless on board here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The review of the Ruataniwha irrigation dam confirms Greenpeace New Zealand’s view that the dam will pollute local rivers, heighten the risk of further water contamination and is a huge economic gamble.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson, Amanda Larsson, says the review of the Ruataniwha dam, released today, has provided no compelling new evidence to support the case for the dam’s construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it confirms that the scheme will contribute to further water pollution - particularly nitrogen - and negative environmental impacts in the region, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The review offers no solutions to the fact that nitrogen pollution already exceeds water quality limits in the region. It actually concedes that land-use changes driven by access to irrigation could likely result in increased nitrogen loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nitrogen is a major river killer, and this review confirms what we have seen with irrigation everywhere - it makes nitrogen pollution worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous environmental impact analysis by HBRIC Ltd has predicted nitrogen losses within the irrigation consent area would increase by an average of 81%. Even best practice mitigation measures would not reduce nitrogen losses by more than a fraction, according to NIWA modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While proponents of large irrigation schemes continue to argue that irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha can improve the environment through ‘flushing flows’, the review concedes that there is great uncertainty about whether the scheme would provide effective flushing of the Tukituki River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larsson says this confirms there is little evidence showing that flushing flows work to improve water quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Evidence actually suggests that dams degrade rivers ecologically and increase waterway and aquifer pollution,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sick rivers mean sick people. We cannot risk a repeat of the Havelock North water crisis, which was the worst of its kind in New Zealand’s recent history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over two thirds of New Zealand rivers are now too polluted to swim in safely. We should be cleaning up and protecting our rivers, not spending ratepayer money on building giant irrigation schemes that drive more industrial agriculture and compound the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council were elected on a mandate of ditching the dam and this review should give them the confidence to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

	Labour MP Megan Woods is promising to return Canterbury’s regional council, ECan, to a democratically elected council. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It follows a mass day-long occupation of the ECan building by local water activists calling for the restoration of democracy and urgent action to save rivers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2010, the Government sacked ECan councilors and instead installed their own commissioners to run the Regional Council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government took away democracy from the people of Canterbury and in return gave us more big irrigation schemes, more cows, and more polluted rivers,” says Gen Toop from Greenpeace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least a hundred protestors crowded inside the foyer to voice their concerns about ECan’s role in dairy intensification in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the occupation, MP Megan Woods &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Megan_Woods/status/908135611025866752" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Labour’s policy is full restoration of democracy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New constituencies are needed that are fair and give equal weight across the region,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Green MP Eugenie Sage visited the occupation and also confirmed the Green’s commitment to restore democracy to Canterbury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today’s protest included farmers, doctors, scientists, and families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bryan Clearwater, a dairy farmer from South Canterbury, joined the occupation and spoke to the crowd about better ways of farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local activist, Shane Herdman, said he just wants his nephews to be able to swim in clean rivers like he did when he was a kid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists set up “The People’s Ecan” inside the lobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They presented ECan acting chairperson, Steve Lowndes, a list of action points for the council to implement in order to clean up rivers in the region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has slammed Labour leader Jacinda Ardern for refusing to rule out new deep sea oil drilling, despite comparing climate change to our nuclear-free moment a few weeks ago.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ardern made the comments to Radio NZ host Guyon Espiner this morning, after questions about whether she would commit to the Green’s policy of no new oil and gas drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says Ardern doesn’t seem to have an understanding about the drivers of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If climate change is our nuclear free moment, then oil, coal and gas are the nuclear bombs. Today Jacinda had an opportunity to walk the talk, but she failed,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The science is clear - we can’t afford to burn the majority of the world’s known fossil fuel reserves if we want to avoid climate catastrophe, let alone search for more. All new deep sea oil reserves need to stay in the ground if we want to keep warming below two degrees. Ending new deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand is the most basic first step you can take when it comes to climate action.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says she was shocked at Ardern’s reasoning for wanting to continue deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Jacinda’s comments make no sense. She says she won’t rule out new deep sea oil drilling because she wants to make sure we have a ‘just-transition’. But the question is - a just transition for whom? We’re talking about big foreign oil companies bringing seismic blasting and drill ships ships here with their own people, to search for oil at some of the most extreme depths in the world,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The companies snooping around our shores, like Statoil and Chevron, are almost single handedly responsible for what’s happening to our climate. They're named in the list of 100 companies in the world that are causing 71% of climate change[1].” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re not talking about the local onshore or shallow water industry in Taranaki, which will need a just transition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Jacinda seems to lack an understanding of these issues. We don’t need ‘advice’ to tell us that oil, coal and gas are the drivers of climate change and need to be kept in the ground - it’s unequivocal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Deep sea oil is not a domestic emissions question that we can kick to a Climate Commission. It's an urgent moral question. We can say yes to the science that says this is the oil we must leave in the ground if we want to protect humanity, or we can continue letting these oil giants put our lives and oceans at risk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the interview, Ardern also refused to rule out an end to new coal mines - the dirtiest fuel on the planet - and advocated a transition to gas, another fossil fuel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has provided a list of key things that the next Government must do to meet the challenge of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Christchurch, 14 September: Pro-democracy water campaigners have taken over the regional council offices in Christchurch today. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re demanding that local democracy be returned to the people of Canterbury so they can get on with saving the region’s ailing rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around 100 Cantabrians have occupied ECan’s lobby and are refusing to move.  They have hung banners reading Save Our Rivers - Democracy Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today we are standing up for our rivers and we are taking our democracy back” says Greenpeace campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “We will not to be silenced and we will not stand aside and let our rivers continue to be destroyed by too many cows.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backed by Greenpeace, local activists are calling for urgent action to save rivers, including a return of their democratic right to vote for their regional councillors. &lt;br&gt;Seven years ago the Government sacked the region’s democratically elected councillors.  They also restricted the ability for Cantabrians to legally challenge decisions about water management made by those commissioners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government have stolen democracy from the people of Canterbury. In return they gave us more big irrigation, more cows and more polluted rivers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists have set up “The People’s Ecan” inside the lobby where they are listing their demands of ECan to clean up rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They will be sharing stories about what’s happened to their rivers and drawing up a manifesto of change for the regional council.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The only way to have clean rivers in NZ is to have fewer cows.  But the Government and ECan are enabling big irrigation schemes to go ahead which will mean more cows and we all know more cows means more polluted rivers”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “All political parties vying for government who are serious about saving our rivers must both reduce the dairy herd and return democracy to the people of Canterbury immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Updates are being posted via social media to:&lt;br&gt;http://greenpeace.nz/ecan-action &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;Gen Toop, Greenpeace agriculture campaigner  021 316 840&lt;br&gt;Sophie Schroeder, Greenpeace communications and media  021 086 47450&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Images and video can be found here:    https://greenpeace.box.com/v/Ecan             &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;Just months before the removal of local democracy former Prime Minister John Key said his Government intended to remove regulatory roadblocks to water storage and irrigation in Canterbury. &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/country/2155/government-move-on-water-projects-applauded" target="_blank"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Government documents then disclosed to The Press under the Official Information Act, revealed that the protection of Canterbury's economic contribution and its future growth were indeed a "key consideration" for suspending democracy. (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECan have  been heavy handed in trying to shut down recent protests about water pollution.  Two weeks ago they served local artist Sam Mahon with an injunction to try and prevent him from handing them a larger than life sculpture of Nick Smith relieving himself in a glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has joined growing public criticism over New World supermarket’s poll on single-use plastic bags, which neglects to offer public the option of an outright ban. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Instead, the New World poll only offers three options to pay varying amounts for each bag - 10 cents, five cents, or no charge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace campaign adviser, Steve Abel, says New World is insulting its customers by not even giving them the option to support a blanket ban on the deadly bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Plastic pollution in the ocean has a devastating impact on marine life. In a recent study, one in three turtles found washed up dead on New Zealand beaches had ingested plastic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “It’s bewildering that New World has excluded the most basic solution to plastic bag pollution - banning bags altogether,” Abel says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The poll seems rigged to support ongoing bag use, either with or without a levy. Without banning single-use plastic bags outright as an option, this poll has zero credibility. Instead, it raises questions about the motives of New World, and its parent company, Foodstuffs.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another of Foodstuffs supermarket brands, PAK’nSAVE, already sells single-use plastic bags. Greenpeace has tried to contact Foodstuffs general marketing manager, Steve Bayliss, in an effort to uncover how much profit the company may currently be making from selling plastic bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There is no information available at present about how PAK'nSAVE uses the income generated from plastic bag sales. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Foodstuffs has said any income from charging for plastic bags at New World in future would be donated to environmental or community causes . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “It is self-defeating logic to use the income made from selling plastic bags, to clean up our environment that is being ruined with these plastic bags,” Abel says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Introducing levies that go towards charities can also create a positive incentive for people to buy plastic bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The best solution is a regulatory ban that is fair and universal for all retailers. If Foodstuffs really are serious about saving turtles and sea-life from plastic pollution in our oceans, then a ban is what they should be supporting and promoting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Now is a time for bold leadership from retailers and politicians, not rigged consumer polls. Other countries have successfully banned the bag - it’s high time New Zealand stepped up too, for the good of our oceans and precious sea life like turtles.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is currently running a petition calling for a ban on single-use plastic bags, and over 35,000 people have signed it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ENDS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bagvote.co.nz/"&gt;The New World poll can be seen here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more info: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Steve Abel, Greenpeace NZ campaign advisor, 021 927 301.&lt;/p&gt;

	A ‘supergroup’ of New Zealand environmental organisations has sent an open letter to the leaders of key political party leaders as they prepare to negotiate a coalition for the next Government.
 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Following what’s become known as the ‘Environment Election’, seven environmental groups have come together to congratulate political parties and politicians for their election success and for the commitments they made during the election campaign to improve the state of our environment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The group is reminding the parties that there is now a strong public expectation that there will be clear gains for freshwater, the climate and conservation in the next three years and is pledging to hold future leaders to their promises.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The letter offers politicians help in achieving those key gains.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Environmental issues were at the centre of the 2017 election campaign. No matter who ends up in Government, they will have a clear mandate and a responsibility to take action on fresh water, climate change, and conservation. And they should know that we will be right there to make sure they do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The open letter &lt;a title="open letter" href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/04180023" target="_blank"&gt;can be seen here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full text of the letter:&lt;/p&gt;

It featured as a bigger concern amongst the electorate than ever before. All of you through your party manifestos made commitments to improve the state of our environment.

This can only be achieved if government facilitates and supports a transformation of the primary sector toward new, environmentally-friendly land uses and practices, coupled with tougher regulation and market signals which reflect the true costs of resource use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Transformative change is required through a new law to establish a statutory carbon budgeting process overseen by an independent Climate Commission to plan, monitor and report on the transition to net zero by 2050. Anything less betrays this and future generations.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This includes the health of the diverse and invaluable terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that sustain both them and valued introduced species.  An increase in funding of DOC’s core budget must be a key component in that strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are also at the core of a genuinely sustainable future and are therefore true legacy issues.  The natural world is our home and there are few greater gifts we can bestow our children than a vibrant, vital and healthy natural world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In response to the Greens’ climate policy announcements today, Greenpeace climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says the Greens should be applauded for their climate policy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It’s exactly the sort of response to the biggest threat facing humanity that we need to see from our leaders. All political parties should be adopting this policy, aiming for New Zealand to have 100% renewable electricity, to be carbon neutral by 2050, and with clear legislative plans to get us there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The policy, released at a Green Party event in Auckland this afternoon, includes a ban on new coal mines and fracking, an end to drilling for deep sea oil and gas, major investment in sustainable transport and ecological agriculture, and significant afforestation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After seeing climate policy from Labour and the Greens, it’s now clear that Jacinda has the talk, but Greens have the walk” says Simcock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“While Labour’s climate policy, released on Friday, has the bones of a good climate policy, and also aims for New Zealand to be carbon neutral by 2050, it lacks the Greens’ will to immediately put a stop to polluting activities, like burning oil, coal, and gas, that we know are the driving force behind climate change.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s pretty disappointing that Labour can’t just commit to killing National’s deep sea oil exploration programme. The industry is on its last legs anyway, and we don’t need a climate commission to tell us that this is the frontier oil that would tip our climate over the edge if it’s burnt. For us to have a future, the oil industry must have no future. Government policy must actively hasten the end of oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was an inspiring moment when Jacinda Ardern compared climate change to New Zealand’s nuclear-free movement, but it remains to be seen if she has the courage and the will to back it up with action” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Climate change is threatening our very survival. It affects all life on Earth, and it is getting a whole lot worse. If we don’t act now, we face a hellish existence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Greens on the other hand, should be applauded for their climate policy. If passed into legislation, it would position New Zealand as a world leader on tackling climate change, and it would give us the hope of a future that we truly can say is clean and green.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	A ‘supergroup’ of New Zealand environmental organisations has sent an open letter to the leaders of key political party leaders as they prepare to negotiate a coalition for the next Government.
 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The group is reminding the parties that there is now a strong public expectation that there will be clear gains for freshwater, the climate and conservation in the next three years and is pledging to hold future leaders to their promises.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The letter offers politicians help in achieving those key gains.&lt;/p&gt;

	The environment was at the centre of this election campaign and, whatever the exact makeup, the new government needs to take action. And Greenpeace says it will be there to make sure they do.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“No matter what the final outcome of the negotiations to form a new government, the environment was at the centre of this election campaign,” says Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For the first time in New Zealand history, protecting rivers was one of the central issues in this campaign. It was significant that both Bill English and Jacinda Ardern spoke of the environment in their post-election speeches. This is the first time I can remember that happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The environment was one of the top three issues this election. A continuation of a ‘business as usual’ attitude with policies of climate denial and river degradation is no longer an option,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says 2017 has been the “Environment Election”, and people all over the country have spoken out against New Zealand’s growing carbon emissions and the systemic waterway degradation that’s been occurring over the past nine years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All four of the parties involved in the negotiations to form a government pledged in the campaign to improve New Zealand’s environmental performance. We expect them to deliver on those pledges in the negotiations. They could get rid of the half billion dollar irrigation pollution fund for a start,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The environmental movement in this country is strong, and growing. If the Government won’t act, then the people will. Rest assured, we will see more protest and direct actions from New Zealanders to protect our rivers and climate, and Greenpeace will be at the forefront,” Norman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the new Government to stand alongside New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours during the COP23 climate change summit, which kicked off last night.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the ‘Pacific COP’ because it is being presided over by Fiji, the summit will take place over the next two weeks in Bonn, Germany.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says it will be the first time the event will be hosted by a Pacific Island state.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It’s hugely significant that Fiji will be at the helm of this year’s climate summit, because it offers a unique opportunity for Pacific voices to be heard,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The world’s response to climate change is absolutely critical to the future of the Pacific, which is at the frontlines of sea level rise and extreme weather events.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“As a large Pacific Island country ourselves, we have a moral responsibility to stand alongside our neighbours and help amplify their voices. There’s never been a more urgent time for us to stand up, stand out, and be bold.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A newly formed group from the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pacificislandrepresent/" target="_blank"&gt;Pacific, called Pacific Island Represent&lt;/a&gt;, crowdfunded almost $17,000 in just 24 hours to send two representatives to COP23. They are demanding that nations who have signed up to Paris meet their obligations as fast as possible. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Larsson says global warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees for people of the Pacific to have the best chance at being able to continue living in their homes. The only way to ensure that is an end to any further oil, coal, and gas extraction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called climate change the ‘nuclear free moment’ of her generation. The Labour-led Government now has the opportunity to honour these strong words with strong action,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The new Government’s target to bring climate emissions to zero by 2050 is bold, but it’s now up to the Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, to implement a strong plan and good policies in the immediate term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says this is vital given that the 2030 climate target set under the previous Government puts New Zealand on track to increase climate emissions in the near term. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Holding onto a climate target that actually increases our emissions would be a serious betrayal of our Pacific neighbours,” she says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Ramping up ambition on climate change means putting an end to all new fossil fuel extraction in New Zealand. It means saying no to seismic blasting for oil and gas off our coasts. And it means hastening the transition to 100% renewable energy and clean transport.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand is &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/15809/petition/1?utm_source=press+release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press+release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=climate&amp;amp;utm_content=cop23"&gt;calling on the Government&lt;/a&gt; to put a moratorium on new oil and gas exploration by halting the upcoming Block Offer process, which opens up hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of New Zealand’s land and sea to companies in search of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

	In the wake of today’s sweeping executive order by US President Donald Trump to reverse efforts to address climate change and instead protect the oil, gas and coal industries, Greenpeace New Zealand is preparing to go and confront his agenda at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Oil giants Chevron and Statoil are currently using the world’s biggest seismic ship, the 125-metre long Amazon Warrior, to search for oil off the Wairarapa Coast.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trump has shares in Chevron, and the oil company funded a large part of his presidential inauguration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace NZ Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says Trump’s agenda is being rejected all over the world because people know that for them to have a future, the oil industry can have no future.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Fossil Fuel President can do his best to implement this climate madness, but it’s going to be vigorously challenged by people everywhere,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In New Zealand, we’re preparing to go to sea to confront this monster of a seismic blasting ship that’s out here in our pristine oceans, doing Trump’s dirty work for Chevron.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace will be making the trip in the newest member of its fleet, a 15-metre boat it crowdfunded nearly $100,000 for in just seven days. The organisation is currently running a &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/boat/vote.html"&gt;public vote&lt;/a&gt; to name the boat, and will hold a naming ceremony in Wellington this Saturday.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says the world is making the transition to clean energy at breakneck speed. Renewables now make up more than half of the world’s new power capacity, and are growing by the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve seen tens of millions of people around the globe march, blockade and take action to demand this transition, and global leaders are listening,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fossil fuel president Trump is impotent when it comes to halting renewables. The global economy’s transition to clean energy cannot be reversed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Here in New Zealand, people are also rising up against this mad pursuit of new oil in the midst of a climate emergency.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature14016.html" target="_blank"&gt;Scientists around the world agree&lt;/a&gt; that we can’t burn even half of the fossil fuel reserves that have already been discovered if we want to avoid runaway climate change.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says this means not a single new oil well, gas field or coal mine can operate anywhere if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Climate change threatens our homes, health and families. Despite this, our Government is actively subsidising oil companies to look for new oil, putting profits above people’s lives.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In New Zealand we’ve already seen extreme storms, flooding, drought and fires in the space of a just a few weeks, and it’s only April. Climate change makes these weather events more frequent and more intense.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“There has never been a more urgent time to act than now.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Amazon Warrior has been searching for oil off the Wairarapa Coast since last November. This involves blasting the seafloor, every eight seconds, day and night.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statoil and Chevron have permits to drill to extreme depths of up to three kilometres if oil is found.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public opposition to the Amazon Warrior has seen protests in ports, petitions garnering tens of thousands of signatures, and significant iwi opposition.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says Greenpeace will head out to sea in the coming weeks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For more info:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Footage of the Amazon Warrior in New Zealand available for download here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie Schroder, Greenpeace NZ Media &amp;amp; Communications, 021 086 47450&lt;br&gt;Russel Norman, Greenpeace NZ Executive Director, 027 458 5181&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is applauding the new Labour-led Government on yesterday’s Speech from the Throne, which focused heavily on the significant challenges New Zealand faces around water quality and climate change. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Gen Toop, says &lt;a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/speech-throne-2017"&gt;the Speech&lt;/a&gt;, read by Governor General Dame Patsy Reddy, confirmed that taxpayer money will no longer be used to support irrigation - a key driver of the expansion of industrial dairy farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ditching any new taxpayer irrigation funding and supporting a shift towards more sustainable farming is a great first step by this Government to clean up NZ’s rivers,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Big irrigation schemes drive more intensive dairy conversions, and more cows means more polluted rivers, so it’s great to see these schemes will no longer have the Government’s stamp of approval.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new Government also indicated they will give more support to Regional Councils to better monitor and control nutrients and sediments in waterways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Stopping irrigation will only slow the expansion of intensive dairy.  If we want clean rivers we urgently need fewer cows, and it looks like the Government also has a strategy to achieve this,” says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The agricultural sector is going to have go through a significant transformation towards regenerative farming methods that look after our land, climate, and rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The farming leadership have so far held up progress on the necessary transition to cleaner farming, which has created dirty rivers and huge public upset.  We hope they’ll finally see the writing is on the wall and actually step up and do their job to lead farmers through this transition”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the new Government also restated it’s commitment to taking action on climate change throughout the Speech, it avoided the critical issue of stopping oil exploration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is great news to see that this Government will protect our conservation estate, and that the climate will be protected from new coal mines on conservation land,” says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But if Jacinda Ardern is serious about making climate change her ‘nuclear free moment’, the Government needs to back up those bold words with bold action by putting an end to oil and gas exploration.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world’s largest seismic oilfields company, Schlumberger, is right now waiting for the New Zealand Government to approve an application to begin seismic blasting for oil across 19,000 square kilometres of the Taranaki Basin this summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The area is right in the middle of the recently discovered blue whale habitat, the whale’s only known feeding ground in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The most obvious way to take real action on climate change right now is to stop oil exploration.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re calling on the new Government to end oil exploration, turn back the Schlumberger ship, and put a stop to the annual ‘Block Offer’ process where huge tracts of our land and sea are opened up for oil and gas exploration.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten thousand New Zealanders have already &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/15809/petition/1"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt;, launched this week, asking Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to end oil exploration and stop seismic blasting in the blue whale habitat this summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This petition is just the latest example of public protest in a decade-long movement of opposition to oil and gas by iwi and local communities up and down the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has made an urgent call for parties engaged in post-election coalition negotiations to rule out an oil prospecting application, which if approved, could see one of the largest 3D seismic blasting surveys that has taken place in the Taranaki Basin (1).

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The world’s largest oilfield survey company, Schlumberger, has applied to search for oil across almost 19,000 square-kilometres of the Taranaki Basin, including in and around the critically endangered Māui dolphin and Blue Whale habitat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As well as harming whales and dolphins, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0195" target="_blank"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; published by science journal Nature, shows seismic blasting for oil has devastating effects on the most critical ocean lifeform, zooplankton, with “enormous implications for ocean ecosystem structure and health”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schlumberger will sell the information it gathers to oil companies, including Austrian oil giant OMV, which has recently been searching for controversial Arctic oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says if the political parties involved in the coalition negotiations really are serious about the environment, then they need to take a stand against “reckless” oil exploration like this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Many have called the 2017 General Election the ‘Environment Election’. Climate, conservation, and rivers were at the front and centre of the election campaign,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All four of the parties involved in the negotiations to form a government pledged to improve New Zealand’s environmental performance. Now is the time to prove that they will take a moral stand when it matters most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This Schlumberger survey is absolutely monstrous. It comes at a time when we know beyond doubt that we can’t afford to burn most of the fossil fuel reserves we know about if we want to avoid climate catastrophe, let alone search for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our future leaders can no longer feign ignorance. Ending new oil exploration in New Zealand is the most basic first step you can take if you’re serious about taking climate action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Companies like OMV and Statoil are almost single handedly responsible for what’s happening to our climate. They're named in the list of only 100 companies in the world that are causing 71% of global emissions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this year, Schlumberger brought the world’s biggest ship, the Amazon Warrior, to seismic blast off the Wairarapa Coast over a seven month period for oil companies including Statoil and OMV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April, Greenpeace activists including Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, put themselves in the water in front of the ship 60 nautical miles out to sea, stopping it from seismic blasting for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists and Greenpeace were charged by the oil division of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE), under the 2013 Amendment to the Crown Minerals Act, dubbed the 'Anadarko Amendment'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have pleaded Not Guilty and are due to next appear in the Napier District Court this Thursday, October 5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Wednesday, March 28: After a whirlwind trip around the country to raise awareness about the dangers of oil and gas exploration, a 17 metre blue whale called Janet has made a special appearance at the annual oil industry conference in Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning, Janet and a group of marine animal friends including sharks, polar bears, and fish, paraded around the conference at Wellington’s TSB Arena to the sound of Richard Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries, before attempting to get into the arena’s main entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgreenpeace.nz%2Fvideos%2F10156218953140775%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The past three days have seen various protest tactics used at the conference by groups concerned about the impacts oil and gas exploration and extraction have on the climate, environment, and marine life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday, a 350 Aotearoa organised climate rally brought together a diverse range of voices, from faith leaders and health professionals, to scientists and grandparents. On Tuesday local group Oil Free Wellington organised a blockade of the arena doors, preventing many delegates from getting in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's activities by Greenpeace provide a theatrical reminder of the impacts oil and gas exploration have on the environment. Over the past few months, Greenpeace has been travelling with Janet the Whale to meet with New Zealand communities affected by oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Kate Simcock, says today Janet was at the oil conference to directly and peacefully confront the oil and gas industry about their activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Most recently, the world’s largest oil exploration ship, the Amazon Warrior, has been blasting for oil off the Taranaki coast, right in the middle of a blue whale habitat and the whale’s only known feeding ground in New Zealand," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Not only are these seismic blasts highly distressing for marine life in the area, but the purpose of them is to search for the oil and gas we can’t afford to burn if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. Science tells us we can’t burn most of the fossil fuel reserves we know about, let alone search for more."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last fortnight, an open letter signed by dozens of respected New Zealanders, and the personal acceptance by Prime Minister Ardern of a 45,000 strong Greenpeace petition, has signalled that the Government is seriously considering the future of oil and gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At day two of the conference yesterday, Minister of Energy and Resources, Megan Woods, spoke about the need to make a just transition to a renewable economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people-powered movement against oil and gas exploration has been growing steadily over the past seven years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people have marched, protested, petitioned and successfully lobbied their local representatives to oppose oil exploration. This has led to the biggest councils in New Zealand formally opposing the annual oil and gas exploration permit process, called the Block Offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And last December, a national gathering of Māori leaders came to an historic agreement to oppose all seismic testing and oil exploration in the waters of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simcock says New Zealand could be a world leader on climate action and transitioning to 100% clean energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says climate change is her generation’s nuclear free moment. In 1985, going nuclear free meant stopping the nuclear ships and standing up to the powerful US military. This year, taking action on climate change means standing up to the oil and gas industry by stopping the exploration ships," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photos and video are available for download here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://greenpeace.box.com/v/wellington28march"&gt;https://greenpeace.box.com/v/wellington28march&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link to the open letter here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/21078/1/1"&gt;https://act.greenpeace.org/page/21078/1/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace commends Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for pledging to increase climate assistance to Pacific nations, but says if Ardern is serious about tackling the issue, she must also put an end oil and gas exploration immediately.

	&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Ardern, Climate Minister James Shaw, and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, are currently on a tour of the Pacific to meet the leaders of island communities on the frontline of climate change impacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ardern has pledged millions of dollars in new aid funding to help Pacific communities recover from cyclone damage and prepare for the next storms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"New Zealand has a moral responsibility to provide climate assistance in the Pacific but we also have a responsibility to address the root cause of this crisis. Allowing oil and gas exploration to continue in New Zealand undermines the Prime Minister’s commitment."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Climate change is an injustice that disproportionately affects our neighbours and kin in the Pacific, who are among the least culpable for causing this crisis," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cyclone Gita, which devastated Tonga and parts of Fiji before hitting New Zealand, was the most recent in a string of extreme weather to impact the Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says weather events like this will become more frequent and more extreme as climate change worsens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Climate science clearly shows that with increasing emissions, especially from from oil, gas, coal and agriculture, these storms will get more intense, more frequent and more damaging," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week was the anniversary of the Oxford Union debate, in which David Lange famously argued that nuclear weapons are morally indefensible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Jacinda Ardern rightly says that climate change is her nuclear free moment. Knowing all that we do about the key drivers of climate change, it is morally indefensible to continue searching for new fossil fuels in 2018," Larsson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have the opportunity and moral responsibility to act on climate change, just as we did in 1985 when we stood up to the powerful US military on nuclear."&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, October 23rd 2013: Commenting on reports that piracy charges against the Arctic 30 are to be dropped and replaced with a charge of hooliganism, Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates. This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest. Those brave men and women went to the Arctic armed with nothing more than a desire to shine a light on a reckless business. They should be with their families, not in a prison in Murmansk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We will contest the trumped up charge of hooliganism as strongly as we contested the piracy allegations. They are both fantasy charges that bear no relation to reality. The Arctic 30 protested peacefully against Gazprom's dangerous oil drilling and should be free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Investigative Committee also say they may charge some activists with use of force against officials, carrying up to ten years in jail. Greenpeace has a 42 year history of entirely peaceful activism, it is a cheap libel to accuse those campaigners of doing anything other than protesting peacefully, they arrived at that oil rig in a ship painted with a dove and a rainbow. Our ship was seized by men with knives and guns, while the Arctic 30 raised their arms. They should be released immediately.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Dame Jane Campion and the 2017 New Zealander of the Year, Taika Waititi, are the latest in a long line of leading New Zealanders to sign an open letter urging Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern end oil and gas exploration.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 60 notable individuals and associations, including scientists, health professionals, iwi leaders, businesspeople, politicians, unions, journalists, poets, actors and musicians, have so far put their name to the &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/21078/1/1"&gt;powerful letter&lt;/a&gt;, which encourages Ardern and her Government to turn her "passion into action" on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ardern made history in the lead-up to the election when she stated that climate change is the nuclear free moment of her generation.&lt;br&gt;World-leading screenwriter, producer, and director, Dame Jane Campion, says tackling climate change is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For me, supporting my Prime Minister’s aim to move strongly and decisively to address climate change is a clear necessity; I want my daughter and all others to inherit a viable planet. Nothing on this earth is more important," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups including the PSA, the New Zealand Medical Association, Unite Union and the Public Health Association, Greenpeace and Forest and Bird; scientists including Professor James Renwick and Dr Jim Salinger; Prof Margaret Mutu FRSNZ, Chairperson of Te Rūnanga-ā-Iwi o Ngāti Kahu, the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Wellington, Rt Rev Justin Duckworth; New Zealand Poet Laureate, Dr Selina Tusitala Marsh; and businesspeople including Phillip Mills, are among those who are supporting the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of New Zealand’s leading climate change scientists, Professor James Renwick, says New Zealand needs to take urgent action on the climate by ending oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All nations need to reduce carbon emissions as soon as possible and New Zealand can show the world how it’s done", he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Alex Macmillan, Public Health Physician and Co-Convener of Ora Taiao (The New Zealand Climate and Health Council), says climate change is one of the most pressing medical issues facing the world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that to protect health from dangerous climate change the world needs to leave known and new coal, oil and gas in the ground, and create a fair and healthy shift to renewable energy. New Zealand is not immune from the health impacts of climate change. New Zealand is not exempt from obligations to end fossil fuel exploration and extraction," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Russel Norman, says science clearly shows that the world can’t afford to burn most of the existing reserves of fossil fuels, let alone seek out and burn new reserves if we are to avoid extremely dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Pacific is on the frontlines of climate change and we must act swiftly to do our part in the global fight to slow down and mitigate the effects we’re already experiencing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over the past year in New Zealand, we’ve experienced large-scale flooding, fires, long periods of drought, and cyclones - events that are made more likely because of climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other well-known New Zealanders including musician Tiki Taane and actors Lucy Lawless and Robyn Malcolm have also signed the letter. It will remain open for signatures, before formally being handed in to the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

	Politicians might have to carry out a river-crossing to get to work today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is creating a fifty metre long waterway* on parliament lawn,  as part of its campaign to save New Zealand rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 1.15pm the environmental organisation will hand the Government a massive petition signed by 68,313 people.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Minister for the Environment, David Parker and Associate Minister Eugenie Sage will receive the petition which calls for an end to state funding of big irrigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Big irrigation schemes means more intensive dairy farms,” says Greenpeace campaigner, Gen Toop.  “More cows equals more pollution in our rivers.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike it’s predecessor, the newly formed Government has &lt;a href="http://community.scoop.co.nz/2017/11/governor-general-speech-from-the-throne-nov-8/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; it will not be supporting or funding irrigation schemes in future. This fulfills a pledge made by both Labour and the Greens in the run up to the election.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This Government’s commitment to ditch funding and support for big irrigation is a huge win for our rivers and the people who have been working hard to protect them” says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Irrigation NZ, the irrigation industry's lobby group, has publicly &lt;a href="http://irrigationnz.co.nz/publication/irrigation-investment-vital-regions-climate-change-adaptation/"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that they are eyeing up the Government’s newly created $1billion regional development fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Despite huge public opposition to these polluting schemes, the big irrigation lobby is already putting its hand back out to the new Government for taxpayer money from the billion dollar regional development fund.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Enough is enough.  There are already too many cows in New Zealand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This new Government must turn down the irrigation lobbyists and keep to it’s word ’about ditching funding and support for big irrigation altogether.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has been a groundswell of local campaigning and a series of peaceful protests against big irrigation schemes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ruataniwha dam, the most high profile project was mothballed earlier this year, after intense local  opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have campaigned to save our rivers from big irrigation schemes. This kind of public momentum cannot be ignored and will continue if irrigation is funded through other means.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, along with &lt;a href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/"&gt;sixteen other organisations&lt;/a&gt;, is calling on the Government to redirect irrigation funds towards investment in a nationwide transition from intensive dairying to more diverse, regenerative farming models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The only way to enjoy clean rivers and pure drinking water is to have fewer cows and a nationwide move to regenerative farming.  We hope the new Government will look to the future and invest in this environmentally sound transition.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Oil driller Anadarko have today been challenged to release their own data showing the potential impact an oil spill could have on New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Texan company have so far withheld the full findings of their own reports from the public, for both deep-sea drill sites off the North Island and Otago, simulating an oil spill in New Zealand waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, who yesterday released a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/New-Zealand-Oil-Spill-Report/"&gt;computer oil spill modelling&lt;/a&gt; report by Wellington based data scientists Dumpark, have called on the Texan oil company, due to start drilling for oil off the coast of New Zealand in the coming months, to stop hiding their own findings from the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Anadarko admitted some of their results did show oil hitting land. Alan Seay, the company’s corporate affairs manager, told listeners of Nine to Noon on Radio NZ National that, in a scenario within Anadarko’s modelling, “yes, oil will reach shore”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel of Greenpeace said: “Anadarko can no longer hide their oil spill findings from the public. They’ve got information locked away on what kind of impacts a spill could have on our seas and our beaches, and they should absolutely make this publicly available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They’ve already admitted that their own spill modelling shows oil hitting our coast, which is presumably why they’re trying to suppress their findings from the public.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday’s report shows the blowout effects of two planned deep-sea drilling locations off the West Coast of the North Island and the East Coast of the South Island. The deepest current production well in New Zealand is 125 meters. Texan oil driller Anadarko is scheduled to begin the first deep-sea drilling (at 1500 meters) this summer off Auckland’s West Coast. The modelling for the north shows the likelihood of oil hitting Auckland’s iconic West Coast beaches and harbours. In the south, a spill off the coast of Otago could spread across the Chatham Rise - a vital commercial fishing ground and marine wildlife habitat - reaching all the way to the Chatham Islands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spill modelling reports are a permitting requirement for oil drilling, however the full and detailed data of deep-sea oil spill modelling reports have not yet been made publicly available on the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) website or by Maritime New Zealand (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) According to Anadarko’s Environmental Impact Assesment document September 2013, Page 117: MetOcean Solutions Limited was contracted to undertake an oil spill trajectory model study to determine the fate, timing and potential of coastal beaching in the unlikely event of a lost of well control.  This oil spill trajectory study was undertaken as part of the DMP [discharge management plan] required under part 200 which Anadarko has submitted to Maritime NZ for approval (see DMP Annex D).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information, contact:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, climate and energy campaigner, Greenpeace: +6421927301 &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/new-zealand/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/6aa0e6ea633963b4cb06baec42051c88.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Friday, November 24: Greenpeace are criticising a reported statement by the new Minister of Energy, Megan Woods, that the decision about whether to issue a permit for oil exploration is merely an “operational matter”. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The statement was made in regards to the Amazon Warrior - the world’s largest seismic survey ship - which is due to arrive in New Zealand waters imminently. However, the Government has yet to approve its permit to seismic blast for oil and gas in the Taranaki Basin this summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ultimately, it’s the Minister’s signature that will make or break this project. It is not merely an operational matter. The choice is firmly in her hands,” says Kate Simcock, Lead Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environmental organisation has sent a letter to the Woods, calling on her to intervene and stop the ship from undertaking its survey.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The new Government has made strong statements about tackling climate change head on and protecting our treasured marine mammals,” says Simcock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Those bold words now need to be honoured with bold action to end the search for new oil and gas in New Zealand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists recently discovered that the permit area is home to a massive blue whale population and is New Zealand’s only known blue whale feeding ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seismic testing involves loud acoustic explosions being fired into the ocean from a survey ship every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, over weeks and months. It is known to disturb marine mammals which rely on sound to communicate, feed, and nurture their young and cause chronic distress over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is the first big test of the Government’s commitment to acting on climate change. If they allow this Beast to blast for oil off our shores, the Government can expect public resistance to  this decision,” says  Simcock.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Hamburg – Following a hearing at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), where the Netherlands brought a case seeking the release of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise and its crew, Greenpeace International General Counsel Jasper Teulings said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Dutch government argued its case extremely strongly. The Netherlands is taking a strong stance in support of the rule of law and the right to peacefully protest. Greenpeace International applauds the Dutch decision as flag state of the Arctic Sunrise in taking the necessary legal steps to gain the release of the ship and the Arctic 30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace International is confident that the Tribunal will take appropriate account of the fundamental rights of the Arctic 30, and the impact of their detention on those rights, in reaching its eventual decision."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Russian Federation did not attend today's hearing and the sitting was closed following the presentation of the Dutch government's oral argumentation. The Netherlands will now lodge written answers to the Tribunal’s questions by the end of Thursday November 7. The presiding judge set a tentative date of Friday November 22 for the Tribunal's provisional order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to Russia's non-appearance at the Tribunal, Joris Thijssen, Campaign Director at Greenpeace Netherlands, said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The decision of the Russian Federation not to attend the hearing is a departure from its previous respectful engagement with the Tribunal. Russia is not formally obliged to participate in the hearing. However it is under an obligation to comply with any ruling which the Tribunal may make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace International hopes that Russia will respect UNCLOS and the rulings of the court. Greenpeace International also thinks that from everyone's perspective ITLOS is the correct place to resolve the issue."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ITLOS is an independent judicial body located in Hamburg, Germany, established to resolve disputes about the interpretation and application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attending the hearing, Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As things stand the Russian authorities propose to jail 30 men and women for two decades because a couple of peaceful protesters tried to hang a small yellow banner from the side of a five hundred thousand tonne oil platform. In our view, there's every prospect the tribunal will order the release of the Arctic 30, pending the arbitration case that the Netherlands has filed against Russia."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam - Prosecuting authorities in Russia were under fire today after it was revealed that they have failed to lift charges of piracy against the Arctic 30, despite pledging to do so.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Russia’s powerful Investigative Committee announced last week that the piracy charges – which carry a 15-year jail sentence – would be replaced with charges of hooliganism. But when the thirty detainees were brought before the Committee over the course of this week, the piracy charge was not withdrawn. Instead each of them was simply served with the additional charge of hooliganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now stand accused of both offences, which carry a maximum sentence of 15 and 7 years, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As things stand the Russian authorities propose to jail thirty men and women for maybe twenty years because two peaceful protesters tried to hang a small yellow banner from the side of a five hundred thousand tonne oil platform. First this saga shocked people across the world, now it has descended into farce. Those campaigners were willing to risk their liberty to shine a light on dangerous Arctic oil drilling, but the authorities’ reaction has been wildly disproportionate. The legal hammer now being wielded against them says so much more about those who have brought these charges than it does about the prisoners. They are neither pirates nor hooligans, they are simply people possessed of a conscience who care about our common future and they should be released immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the charge of piracy is withdrawn, by law the detainees should be immediately released. This is because international law prohibits one country from seizing another country's vessels in international waters, except in the most extreme cases, such as piracy. Allowing states to seize each other's vessels for lesser trumped up charges would be a major threat to international relations and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday next week the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) will hear the case brought by the Netherlands demanding the release of the 30 and the return of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The Netherlands hold the boarding and subsequent detention to be illegal. Greenpeace International has submitted an Amicus Curiae brief in support of the Dutch request (1). President Putin and the Investigative Committee have both publicly admitted that this is not a case of piracy, which begs the question whether maintaining the piracy charge is just a ruse to avoid the prisoners’ inevitable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities clearly stated to the world’s media that the absurd charge of piracy would be withdrawn, but they have not been true to their word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International understands from diplomatic sources that the Arctic 30 are being moved from a detention centre in Murmansk to a jail in St Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Greenpeace are not aware of the reasons for the move. Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The detainees shouldn’t be in jail at all, they should be free to be join their families and to restart their lives. St Petersburg has some daylight in the winter months, unlike Murmansk. And families and consular officials will now find it easier to visit the thirty. But there is no guarantee that conditions inside the new detention centre will be any better than in Murmansk. In fact they could be worse. There is no justification whatsoever to keep the Arctic 30 in any prison for a day longer. They are prisoners of conscience who acted out of a determination to protect us all, and they should be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Russel Norman, says the Government has listened to people throughout the country who have campaigned for seven years to bring an end to offshore oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last month, an open letter signed by dozens of respected New Zealanders, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s personal acceptance of a 50,000 strong Greenpeace petition, telegraphed an announcement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, the Coalition Government announced an end to the annual offshore ‘Block Offer’ process, which sees hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of New Zealand land and sea being offered to companies to explore for oil and gas. The Government will continue offering onshore Taranaki for exploration, and will not revoke existing exploration contracts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says today’s announcement means, "the tide has turned irreversibly against Big Oil in New Zealand".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her Coalition Government have taken an historic step and delivered a huge win for the climate, spurred on by the tens of thousands of people and environmental NGOs like Greenpeace who have fought for years to end new oil and gas exploration," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Today’s announcement is significant internationally too. By ending new oil and gas exploration in our waters, the fourth largest Exclusive Economic Zone on the planet is out of bounds for new fossil fuel exploitation. New Zealand has stood up to one of the most powerful industries in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There is still some work to do, however. We are disappointed that onshore Taranaki, where communities have to deal with ongoing fracking and exploration, is exempt from the ban, and that existing offshore exploration contracts will remain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"While we will continue to demand a complete end to fossil fuel exploration on land and sea as well as the revoking of existing permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This has been one of Greenpeace New Zealand’s longest running campaigns and today marks a great success for so many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Bold global leadership on the greatest challenge of our time has never been more urgent, and Ardern has stepped up to that climate challenge. We’d like to congratulate the Prime Minister and her Coalition Government for acting decisively for our future and our children’s future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace also supports the Prime Minister’s commitment to a just transition to a clean energy future, which can provide jobs and a big boost to our economy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tens of thousands of people, alongside iwi, have marched, protested, petitioned and successfully lobbied their local representatives to oppose oil exploration over the last seven years. This has led to the biggest councils in New Zealand formally opposing the Block Offers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand was on the vanguard of highlighting the risks of offshore oil exploration and drilling when in 2011 it formed an alliance with East Cape iwi, Te Whānau-ā-Apanui, and mobilised a flotilla to protest seismic blasting for deep sea oil by Brazilian oil company, Petrobras, who subsequently abandoned the initial survey and then surrendered their permit altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A key aspect to the success of the seven-year oil campaign has been the alliance between Greenpeace, Māori, and the wider community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most recently, East Coast iwi Ngāti Kahungunu mobilised its traditional bluewater Waka Hourua, Te Matau a Māui, to challenge the Amazon Warrior as it searched for oil on behalf of Statoil, Chevron and OMV off the Wairarapa Coast. Greenpeace also travelled the 60 nautical miles out to sea out to meet the seismic blasting ship in crowd-funded boat, Taitu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the Amazon Warrior’s arrival, over 80 coastal hapū declared their unanimous rejection of oil exploration, culminating in a historic agreement by the National Iwi Chairpersons Forum last December to oppose all seismic testing and oil exploration in the waters of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Oil could wash up on New Zealand shorelines if there was an accident at Anadarko’s drilling site off the west coast, according to the Texan company’s own data.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;According to information just released, Anadarko’s modelling assumed a spill rate of 12,000 barrels of oil every day for one well location and 18,000 barrels at another. Greenpeace’s own spill modelling report, released in October, which was called “scare-mongering” by prime minister John Key, assumed a more conservative 10,000 barrels per day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anadarko’s oil spill data estimates a spill would reach New Zealand shores in 66.05% of cases in autumn and 51.82% in summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The information has only become publicly available this afternoon following requests made under the Official Information Act and in Parliament. Oil companies are required to compile these documents and submit them to government. However, the information was omitted from wider documents made available in September.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The documents are also at the middle of a current High Court case. Earlier this week, lawyers for Greenpeace argued that the government’s Environmental Protection Authority made an ‘error in law’ by allowing Anadarko to go-ahead with its drilling programme without looking at these very documents, which include reports on oil spill modelling and emergency plans to deal with an oil spill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minister for Energy and Resources Simon Bridges has repeatedly claimed that exploratory deepwater drilling “is a highly regulated area where we put businesses like Anadarko through the wringer” [1].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Argent, chief policy advisor for Greenpeace, said: “The industry’s own data shows that oil could end up on our beaches. And there’s more than a hint that the government and the oil lobbyists colluded to keep this secret. They simply do not want the New Zealand public to know about the potential for an oil spill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The whole government process around deepsea oil drilling has swung between utter farce and total shambles.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full document release is here: http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Environmental/Environmental-requirements/Requirements-for-installations/Disharge-management-plans.asp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information, contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Argent, chief policy advisor for Greenpeace: 021 971234&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Abel, energy campaigner for Greenpeace: 021 927301&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niall Bennett, head of communications for Greenpeace: 0221 831740&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now three years since the Fukushima nuclear disaster &lt;a title="Fukushima nuclear disaster timeline" href="/new-zealand/Global/international/briefings/nuclear/2014/Fukushima-3rd/Timeline.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;began in March 2011.&lt;/a&gt; Here are the stories of five of the victims who have struggled over these three long years to rebuild their lives. Like tens of thousands forced to flee the second biggest release of radioactive particles in history, they have been ignored and abandoned by their government and TEPCO, owner of the disaster site. They fear being forgotten and that life will get even worse if they are forgotten. Greenpeace brought six activists to Japan to meet them to help spread their stories and keep them in peoples’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Provide evidence to back up your opinions. If you have it provide evidence of local support for your issue (like a signed petition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Include relevant newspaper clippings or a briefing paper on the issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ask for a response to your letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Always sign the letter and print your name and address below your signature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you do not receive a response, follow up with a phone call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If their response does not address the issue or answer your question, write again and ask them to clarify their response - don't let them ignore the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Keep all your letters and responses for reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 dir="ltr"&gt;Email your representative&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Email is quick and easy way to tell your politician how you feel. If they get lots of emails on an issue, it shows how the voting public is thinking. Email is effective when numbers count and you want to show support for an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Remember, however, that an email is easily deleted. Because your politician's inbox is probably overflowing, they may not even open your email. If you want a politician to read your words, write them a snail mail letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Suggestions for writing an email:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Treat it as an electronic personal letter. Follow the same rules for form and content that you would when writing a letter (tips above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Avoid symbols, shorthand or email-speak. Write in complete sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Use your subject line. Think carefully about your email subject line so your time-strapped politician knows clearly what the issue is. Put the name of any related legislation in the subject line. This will help them categorise the email and respond more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Include your home address. Always put your postal address somewhere in the body of your email. This will increase your chances of getting a written response to your email. Although email communication is starting to serve a more formal role, most parliamentarians and their staff avoid establishing an electronic conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	A Government report just out, seems to suggest that Fonterra’s flashy PR campaign to promote intensive dairy might be failing.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The survey by the Ministry for Primary Industries shows that only half of Kiwis view NZ’s dairy industry in a positive light - due in large part to its bad environmental record and role in freshwater pollution. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace says this research should serve as a major wake-up call for Fonterra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country’s largest corporate has spent huge amounts on its public image in recent times, including expensive advertisements with ex All Black, Richie McCaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Despite Fonterra’s countless TV ads and PR efforts, New Zealanders patience with intensive dairying is wearing thin," says Sustainable Agriculture campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The only way for Fonterra to restore its tarnished image is to stop spinning and actually clean up their act. They have to deal to the tide of pollution getting into NZ’s rivers and lakes from too many cows."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report shows that in 2017, only 50% of rural respondents and 47% of urban respondents held positive views towards dairy farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2009, in the same survey, 83% of rural NZ’ers and 78% of urban NZ’ers held a positive view of farming as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Horticulture and sheep and beef farming were viewed the most positively out of the primary sector industries. New Zealanders positive views towards horticulture had increased 6% in rural NZ and 11% in urban NZ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main reasons cited for negative views of the dairy industry are it’s bad environmental record and freshwater pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the quotes from respondents read; "We should be competing on our clean, green image and producing products that have higher value than just milk powder. - Rural Whangarei male.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Alongside it’s flashy TV ads, Fonterra points proudly to its fencing efforts. But fences don’t stop nitrogen rich cow urine leaching into our waterways." says Toop."It’s like trying to keep the rain out of your house by roofing with chicken wire.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, Fonterra’s fencing efforts only apply to rivers and streams wider than one metre despite research proving that small streams need attention too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A recent scientific report, led by the principal scientist for AgResearch-Invermay's Environment Group, found that more than three quarters of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution flowing into our freshwater catchments comes through small streams that currently aren't required to be fenced off. (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If Fonterra wants to retain any shred of public confidence in New Zealand then it needs to stop bleating about fences and commit to fewer cows. That’s the only thing that will save our rivers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Note: In 2008 the question was asked about ‘farming’ in general - this was split into two specific questions in 2017 that asked directly about ‘sheep and beef’ and ‘dairy’ farming.&lt;/p&gt;

	Without the oceans there would be no life on Earth. They help create the air we breathe, drive our weather systems and are home to a staggering 80 per cent of all life on Earth. We know that human activities are having a serious impact, so here are some simple things you can do to help save our oceans.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 20px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;1. Watch what you are eating!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP021XW.jpg" alt="Watch what you are eating"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid buying seafood that comes from stocks that are being overfished or is caught using destructive fishing methods. &lt;a title="Seafood Red List" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/" target="_blank"&gt;Check the red list here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand that your supermarket and tuna brand source sustainable tuna. Look for tuna cans with "Pole and Line" or "Hand-Caught."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak up about your concerns if you spot a threatened species on the menu or at the seafood counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;2. Use less plastic so there's less chance of it ending up in the sea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP0TBM.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can drink tap water in a reusable bottle or take along your favourite mug to your local coffee shop. Use reusable food containers, shopping bags and picnic supplies. Try to reuse and recycle as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;3. Reduce your Energy Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP04RMV.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to use less fossil fuel to reduce the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the oceans. Leave the car at home at least one day a week and inflate your tyres more often. Be conscious of your energy use at home and work, switch to energy efficient light bulbs and unplug your appliances and gadgets or use a power strip to cut power to electronics when they are not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;4. Keep your beach clean!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP02JRS.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's obvious but please don't throw your rubbish on the beach or into the sea. Make a difference and join in with beach clean-ups. You can do it on your own or join a community team. If you smoke, use an ashtray and please don't flush your cotton buds down the toilet as they end up in the sea and are amongst the main source of litter on our beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;5. Be a responsible traveller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP0FC2.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your holiday destination chose a country that supports ocean sanctuaries. Always research the most eco-friendly option and whenever possible avoid flying or offset your carbon footprint by supporting for example clean-energy projects. Avoid buying coral jewellery, tortoiseshell hair accessories, and shark or other endangered marine species products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;6. Keep it Clean!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP0WY3.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how far from the sea you live, your drainage water will eventually end up in the ocean. Use biodegradable washing powder, chemical free household and gardening products or simple, non-toxic ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, or lemon juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;7. Be an ocean friendly pet owner.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP01VO5.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never flush kitty litter down the toilet and avoid buying wild caught saltwater fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;8. Become an ocean defender and help influence change in your community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP01HX8.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the oceans, marine life and the need for ocean sanctuaries, then share your knowledge so you can educate and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help influence change. Contact your local politicians to let them know you support ocean sanctuaries and other marine conservation projects, and vote for environmentally-minded parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;9. Join Greenpeace.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/oceans/2014/GP01JE3.jpg" alt="Use less plastic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be a volunteer and a financial supporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-size: 12pt; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 15pt;"&gt;10. Share this with family and friends.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="width: 800px; margin-top:15px"&gt;&lt;a onclick="return fbs_click()" href="#"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/code/2012/Forest_Solutions/images/ShareFacebook.png" border="0" alt="Share on Facebook" width="162" height="29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a onclick="return twitter_click()" href="#"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/code/2012/Forest_Solutions/images/ShareTwitter.png" border="0" alt="Share on Titter" width="162" height="29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s Budget, Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor, said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This Budget shows a deficit of ambition. There is nothing in here to back our potentially world-leading clean energy sector, which could provide tens of thousands of jobs and give the economy a multi-billion dollar boost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Leading finance houses are pouring money in to clean energy, and smart governments around the world are realising this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But this Budget has instead ignored the New Zealand-grown industries that would put this country at the heart of a growing global industrial sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A smart, sensible Budget would have established a clean energy investment bank to support business investment in energy efficiency and sustainable transport fuels.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor: 021 971 234&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niall Bennett, Greenpeace’s head of communications: 0221 831 740&lt;/p&gt;

	Multitudes of documents received under the Official Information Act reveal that the Ministry for Business, Innovation &amp; Employment (MBIE) has had a close relationship with TCIL for more than four years, and has worked with them to protect the oil industry and counteract the advocacy work of environmental groups like Greenpeace.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These documents and emails are a fraction of the full picture - MBIE declined a number of requests for certain correspondence with TCIL on the grounds that over 2,000 documents exist.&lt;/p&gt;

	A group of leading New Zealanders, including scientists, health professionals, unions, and the current New Zealand Poet Laureate, have launched an open letter urging Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to end oil and gas exploration.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen notable individuals and associations have so far put their name to the &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/pm-open-letter"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, which encourages Ardern and her Government to turn her "passion into action" on climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ardern made history in the lead-up to the election when she stated that climate change is the nuclear free moment of her generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacific poet-scholar and current New Zealand Poet Laureate, Dr Selina Tusitala Marsh, has signed the letter out of concern for climate change. In her 2013 poem, ‘NZ, the Lucky Country’, she writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"... We need inter-generationality / eco-sustainability / for our fossil fuels and energy / in this land of space, water and sea / We need a bit of Hillary / who had the same fear of heights as you and me / but knocked the bastard off anyway…"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groups including the PSA, the New Zealand Medical Association, Unite Union and the Public Health Association, Greenpeace and Forest and Bird; scientists including Professor James Renwick and Dr Jim Salinger; Prof Margaret Mutu FRSNZ, Chairperson of Te Rūnanga-ā-Iwi o Ngāti Kahu, the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Wellington, Rt Rev Justin Duckworth; and businesspeople including Phillip Mills, are among those who are supporting the call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of New Zealand’s leading climate change scientists, Professor James Renwick, says New Zealand needs to take urgent action on the climate by ending oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"All nations need to reduce carbon emissions as soon as possible and New Zealand can show the world how its done", he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Alex Macmillan, Public Health Physician and Co-Convener of Ora Taiao (The New Zealand Climate and Health Council) says climate change is one of the most pressing medical issues facing the world today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We know that to protect health from dangerous climate change the world needs to leave known and new coal, oil and gas in the ground, and create a fair and healthy shift to renewable energy. New Zealand is not immune from the health impacts of climate change. New Zealand is not exempt from obligations to end fossil fuel exploration and extraction," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Russel Norman, says the world can’t afford to burn even half of existing reserves of fossil fuels, let alone seek out and burn new reserves if we are to avoid extremely dangerous climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Pacific is on the frontlines of climate change and we must act swiftly to do our part in the global fight to slow down and mitigate the effects we’re already experiencing," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Right now we have yet another cyclone forming that could hit our Pacific Island neighbours, before heading our way. Over the past year in New Zealand, we’ve experienced large-scale flooding, fires, long periods of drought, and cyclones - events that are made more likely because of climate change."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other well-known New Zealanders including musician Tiki Taane and actors Lucy Lawless and Robyn Malcolm have also signed the letter. It will remain open for signatures for a few more weeks, before formally being handed in to the Prime Minister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A PDF of the letter is available &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/Open-letter-to-Jacinda-Ardern/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	North Pole, April 15, 2013 — Four young people on a mission with Greenpeace have planted a flag on the seabed beneath the North Pole, at the same spot where a submarine planted a Russian flag claiming the Arctic for Moscow. (1) The young people planted their ‘flag for the future’ four kilometres beneath the ice at the top of the world and called for the region to be declared a global sanctuary. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tHox4mN8ars" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaigners (2) held a ceremony this weekend at the geographic North Pole, led by two Arctic Indigenous ambassadors. There they cut a hole in the ice and lowered a flag designed by a child (3) from Malaysia, through the freezing waters to the seabed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flag is attached to a glass and titanium time capsule (4) containing the signatures of nearly &lt;a href="http://www.savethearctic.org/" target="_blank"&gt;three million people&lt;/a&gt;, including actors, musicians, artists and business leaders (5) who asked for their names to be taken to the Pole when they joined Greenpeace’s campaign calling for the Arctic to be protected from exploitation. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu this weekend joined the call for a global sanctuary, saying, "I offer my full support to these young people who travelled to the North Pole on behalf of those whose lives are being turned upside down by climate change.” [6]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollywood actor Ezra Miller — star of We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Perks of Being a Wallflower — is one of the youth ambassadors who planted the flag and the names. Another is 26-year-old Josefina Skerk, an Indigenous activist and Sami Parliament member in Sweden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"By coming to the top of the world and planting this flag, we’re hoping to inspire young people everywhere. We’re here to say this special area of the Arctic belongs to no person or nation, but is the common heritage of everyone on Earth," said Skerk. "Our names and those of millions more are now planted on the seabed beneath the Pole. Together we're asking that this area be declared a global sanctuary, off-limits to oil companies and political posturing. We stand in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples, in the whole of the Arctic, whose way of life is now being threatened by the unchecked greed of industry.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The expedition coincided with the first ever meeting at the North Pole of the Arctic Council, the governing body comprised of foreign ministers and senior officials from Arctic states. As the expedition started, Skerk requested a meeting with the group, but was refused. The weeklong expedition to the Pole is part of a global campaign to protect the Arctic, under threat from climate change, oil companies, industrial fishing and shipping. As global warming melts the sea ice, companies such as Shell, Gazprom and Statoil are moving in to exploit the region's oil as nation states lay claim to areas previously covered by ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youth ambassadors and Greenpeace campaigners have challenged the companies and nations seeking to profit from climate change. By planting the time capsule and flag, they have drawn a line in the ice, telling the polluters and oil companies: you come no further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The young people are part of a Greenpeace team that trekked for one week across the frozen ocean in freezing winds and temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius. They traveled around 10 km a day, each dragging heavy sleighs weighing 80kg behind them. In a remote and dangerous environment their supplies dwindled as the shifting ice took them further from the Pole. The team then hitched a ride with a helicopter that was flying in from the nearby Barneo Base, to put them within striking distance of the Pole, allowing them to ski and drift a shorter final distance and complete their journey to the top of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -ENDS-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] A Russian submarine, piloted by explorer Artur Chilligarov, planted the Russian flag beneath the Pole in 2007. Before embarking on his expedition Chilligarov said: “The Arctic is Russian. We must prove the North Pole is an extension of the Russian landmass.” Wikileaks cables later revealed he was acting on the instructions of the Kremlin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] The Team Aurora youth ambassadors include 20-year-old musician and Hollywood actor Ezra Miller, star of We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Perks of Being a Wallflower; Renny Bijoux, member of the Youth Parliament from the Seychelles; Kiera-Dawn Kolson of the Tso’Tine-Gwich’in nations in Northern Canada, and Josefina Skerk, an Indigenous activist and member of the Sami Parliament in Sweden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] The ‘flag for the future’ was designed by 13-year-old Sarah Batrisyia from Malaysia, who won a global competition run by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts and Greenpeace. The contest was judged by fashion icon Dame Vivienne Westwood&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[4] The time capsule was designed and made in Amsterdam by Joris Laarman Labs. More information on the construction of the time capsule can be found here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[5] Among those who asked Greenpeace to take their names to the bottom of the ocean at the top of the world are boy band One Direction, Paul McCartney, Penelope Cruz and dozens of other actors, musicians, artists, and members of the business community like Richard Branson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[6] Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: "I offer my full support to these young people who travelled to the North Pole on behalf of those whose lives are being turned upside down by climate change. The melting of the Arctic matters to every person on earth, and I believe that we must work together to create a sanctuary in the uninhabited area around the North Pole. We owe it to future generations to protect the Arctic and keep destructive industry away from this fragile and beautiful place."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Budget Must Back Kiwi Innovation, Say Greenpeace.  

Backing home-grown clean energy in Thursday’s Budget could kick-start a multi-billion dollar bonanza for New Zealand’s economy, creating tens of thousands of jobs, say Greenpeace.

 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmental group says that investing just $500million in clean energy innovation could see the country’s coffers topped up with billions of dollars over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful Budget, Greenpeace say, will see the announcement of three clean energy innovation platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A Green Investment Bank to invest in clean energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transport fuels. This would seek to co-finance clean energy projects with the private sector, working with the market to build industry capacity;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A Clean Energy Innovation Agency to provide government support for research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of clean energy. This would provide substantial grant-based support for renewable energy across multiple areas (ocean energy; sustainable transport fuels)&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A Clean Energy Innovation Fund to support business investment in research and development, proof of concept and early stage of commercialisation of clean technologies. Successful program applicants will need to demonstrate the extent of their project's contribution to a reduction in carbon emissions or energy consumption, and to the sustainability of a business or industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;And backing existing New Zealand clean energy industries in this way, instead of selling them off, will make much more economic sense, say Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor, said: “A Budget for the people of New Zealand would back our Kiwi know-how, our Kiwi expertise and our Kiwi innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;“And it would do this by setting up three key platforms to boost our world-class skills and knowledge in clean energy. This is an industry where New Zealand, given the right government support, could be a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;“Companies like Meridian are right at the heart of this industry. They are the incubators of renewable energy expertise and the developers of cutting edge technologies that a changing world is demanding. That’s why they shouldn’t be sold off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Eight in 10 New Zealanders think that the brakes should be put on the government’s controversial move to criminalise aspects of peaceful protests at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Crown Minerals Bill is expected to pass its final stage in Parliament today. But, in a Horizon Research poll carried out over the weekend, 79 per cent of those asked said that the amendments to the Bill, which will create new offences against protest activity in the seas around New Zealand, should be withdrawn completely or sent back to a select committee of politicians for more scrutiny and more chance for the public to have a say.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Less than three per cent said they ‘strongly agree’ that the amendments were ‘about right’ and over half of all those questioned opposed the amendment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The new laws are being proposed after a flotilla of vessels, including several yachts and Te Whanau-a-Apanui fishing vessel the San Pietro, peacefully confronted the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras off the East Cape in 2010. Petrobras has since ditched any plans to drill in New Zealand waters.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;And over 60 per cent of National Party supporters think the amendments should be dropped or referred back to a select committee too.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Steve Abel of Greenpeace, who commissioned the polling, said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Simon Bridges’ dog of a Bill breaks international law, has been hammered by politicians and lawyers, and is opposed by ordinary New Zealanders.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“His fumbling and bungling to push these controversial amendments through Parliament show a total disregard of public feeling including that of many National Party voters.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Bridges has already established himself as little more than a yes-man for foreign oil companies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The most risky activity in the deep-sea for our economy and way of life is not peaceful protest. It’s deep-sea oil drilling.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Last week, a range of well-known New Zealand groups and individuals slammed the government’s move.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a joint statement, Greenpeace, Rt Hon Geoffrey Palmer QC, Peter Williams QC, WWF, Forest and Bird, Dame Anne Salmond, Rikirangi Gage of Te Whanau-a-Apanui, Sir Ngatata Love, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, George Armstrong (founder of the Peace Squadron), Amnesty International NZ, Lucy Lawless and many others, said that energy minister Simon Bridges’ “new law is a sledgehammer designed to attack peaceful protest” and is “being bundled through Parliament without proper scrutiny despite its significant constitutional, democratic and human rights implications.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over 30,000 people have now &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/reject-the-Anadarko-Amendment/"&gt;added their name to the statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The amendments to the Crown Minerals Bill, announced by Simon Bridges on Easter Sunday, “breach international law, and attack our democratic freedoms” said the group.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The amendments faced further criticism when legal advice was released last week which found “that the proposed amendments to the Crown Minerals (Permitting and Crown Land) Bill would breach international law in a number of respects.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proposals include penalties up to $50,000 for an individual, up to 12 months imprisonment and up to $100,000 for a body corporate, and enable the Navy or a police officer to nominate assistants who can stop and detain a ship entering an exclusion zone, remove a person from an exclusion zone. All these parties carry next to no criminal or civil liabilities for anything that happens as a result.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s Budget, which includes plans to sell off New Zealand-owned Meridian Energy, Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s chief policy advisor, said:

“The half-baked decision to sell clean energy gem Meridian could lose the economy billions of dollars."
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The cash generated by selling this company will look like peanuts compared to the huge rewards on offer if the Government actually backed our clean energy expertise, rather than flogging it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The global clean energy market is booming. But New Zealand’s chance to use the innovation and expertise that is fostered in Meridian, and pocket the billions of dollars on offer in this worldwide industry, has just been kicked into touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is not a budget for New Zealanders. This is not a Budget backing our Kiwi innovation and expertise. And it’s not a Budget for our long-term prosperity.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read the Greenpeace-published report, The Future is Here: New Jobs, New Prosperity and a New Clean Economy, go here: &lt;a href="Responding%20to%20today%E2%80%99s%20Budget,%20which%20includes%20plans%20to%20sell%20off%20New%20Zealand-owned%20Meridian%20Energy,%20Nathan%20Argent,%20Greenpeace%E2%80%99s%20chief%20policy%20advisor,%20said:%20%20%E2%80%9CThe%20half-baked%20decision%20to%20sell%20clean%20energy%20gem%20Meridian%20could%20lose%20the%20economy%20billions%20of%20dollars.%20%20%E2%80%9CThe%20cash%20generated%20by%20selling%20this%20company%20will%20look%20like%20peanuts%20compared%20to%20the%20huge%20rewards%20on%20offer%20if%20the%20Government%20actually%20backed%20our%20clean%20energy%20expertise,%20rather%20than%20flogging%20it.%20%20%E2%80%9CThe%20global%20clean%20energy%20market%20is%20booming.%20But%20New%20Zealand%E2%80%99s%20chance%20to%20use%20the%20innovation%20and%20expertise%20that%20is%20fostered%20in%20Meridian,%20and%20pocket%20the%20billions%20of%20dollars%20on%20offer%20in%20this%20worldwide%20industry,%20has%20just%20been%20kicked%20into%20touch.%20%20%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20not%20a%20budget%20for%20New%20Zealanders.%20This%20is%20not%20a%20Budget%20backing%20our%20Kiwi%20innovation%20and%20expertise.%20And%20it%E2%80%99s%20not%20a%20Budget%20for%20our%20long-term%20prosperity.%E2%80%9D%20%20ENDS%20%20To%20read%20the%20Greenpeace-published%20report,%20The%20Future%20is%20Here:%20New%20Jobs,%20New%20Prosperity%20and%20a%20New%20Clean%20Economy,%20go%20here:%20http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/reports/The-Future-is-Here-report/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/reports/The-Future-is-Here-report/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The National led government has an appalling record with regards to tackling climate change. And their own official figures speak for themselves. Emissions are currently on track to be 50 per cent higher than our promised reductions.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We have dropped out of Ernst and Young’s ranking as a desirable place to do clean energy business and we have been scored as “very poor” on the global Climate Change Performance Index 2015. And this despite having 80% renewable electricity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things must be bad and it’s clear to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government has focused heavily on promoting oil, gas and minerals exploration, opening up vast areas of land and sea for fossil fuel extraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has failed to introduce a single policy to encourage the growth in clean energy technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government made the controversial decision to withdraw from the second commitment term of the legally binding Kyoto Protocol established to reduce carbon pollution, damaging its international reputation on climate action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government’s Energy Strategy is clearly focused on achieving a major escalation of petroleum and coal extraction whilst undermining our renewables industry by further weakening the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ETS has been the only tool of note that was introduced to drive down emissions from the nation’s biggest polluters. The introduction of the scheme in agriculture has been deferred indefinitely and continues to be subsidised to the tune of over a billion dollars of taxpayers money. Things have got so bad that even the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has labelled the ETS a failure and a farce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government pulled the plug on biofuel subsidies in 2012, much to the dismay of the investors like then Greenstone Energy and the Biofuel Association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government has renewed its commitment to the target of 90% of our electricity coming from renewable energy by 2025, but  has made no plan for getting there. The Government’s latest estimates indicates that we will still only achieve 80% renewable electricity supply in 2030, with both coal and gas still supplying almost 20% of electricity demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	 Six Greenpeace Climbers Scale Shell’s Arctic-Bound Oil Rig 6 April 2015, Pacific Ocean: Six Greenpeace climbers have intercepted an Arctic-bound Shell oil rig in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, 750 miles north-west of Hawaii and have scaled the 38,000 tonne platform. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The multi-national team of volunteers will set up camp on the underside of the Polar Pioneer’s main deck. They have supplies to last for several days and are equipped with technology which will allow them to communicate with supporters around the world in real-time, despite being hundreds of miles from land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The climb" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2015/The%20Crossing/How-Andreas-did-it_v_small.jpg" alt="The climb" width="600" height="339"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last week, the United States Department of Interior approved Shell’s drilling lease for the Chukchi Sea in the Alaskan Arctic. This means that in 100 days, Shell could begin drilling in the Alaskan Arctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At dawn this morning, the six, from the USA, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Austria, sped towards the Polar Pioneer, which Shell intends to use to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea, in inflatable boats launched from the Greenpeace ship Esperanza. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They are also hoping to unfurl a banner containing the names of millions of people from around the world who are opposed to Arctic oil drilling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aliyah Field, one of the six, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aliyahfield/status/585128267180539906" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; from the Polar Pioneer: “We made it! We're on Shell's platform. And we're not alone. Everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power! #TheCrossing." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Johno Smith from New Zealand, another one of the six, said: “We’re here to highlight that in less than 100 days Shell is going to the Arctic to drill for oil. This pristine environment needs protecting for future generations and all life that will call it home. But instead Shell’s actions are exploiting the melting ice to increase a manmade disaster. Climate change is real and already inflicting pain and suffering on my brothers and sisters in the Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “I believe that shining a light on what Shell is doing will encourage more people to take a strong stand against them and other companies who are seeking to destroy this planet for profit. I’m just one voice out here, but I know I’m not alone, and millions if not billions of voices demanding the right to safe and healthy lives will have a huge chance of changing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2015/The%20Crossing/firstpic-from-rig.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Polar Pioneer, which is being transported on a 712 feet (217 metres) long heavy-lift vessel called Blue Marlin, is one of two drilling vessels heading towards the Arctic for Shell this year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second, the Noble Discoverer, is one of the oldest drill ships in the world. In December 2014, Noble Drilling, one of Shell’s biggest Arctic sub-contractors and owner of the Noble Discoverer, pleaded guilty to committing eight felonies in connection with Shell’s failed attempts to drill in the Arctic Ocean in 2012. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Both the drilling vessels are crossing the Pacific and are expected to arrive in Seattle around the middle of April before heading to the Chukchi Sea. Shell intends to use the port of Seattle as a base for the company’s Arctic fleet, despite growing opposition from a range of Seattle-based groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The 35 person crew on board the Esperanza have tailed the Polar Pioneer for more than 5000 nautical miles, since it left Brunei Bay in Malaysia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The six climbers, who will not interfere with the navigation or operation of the vessel, are Aliyah Field, 27, from the USA (@aliyahfield), Johno Smith, 32, from New Zealand (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nsp_one"&gt;@nsp_one&lt;/a&gt;), Andreas Widlund, 27, from Sweden (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/widlundandreas"&gt;@widlundandreas&lt;/a&gt;), Miriam Friedrich, 23, from Austria (@&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mirifriedrich"&gt;mirifriedrich&lt;/a&gt;), Zoe Buckley Lennox, 21, from Australia (@&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/zoevirginia"&gt;zoevirginia&lt;/a&gt;) and Jens Loewe, 46, from Germany (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Jens4762"&gt;@jens4762&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to Contact Energy’s announcement this morning that Otahuhu gas power station will close next month due to the growth of renewable energy, Simon Boxer, Greenpeace New Zealand’s senior energy campaigner, said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Yet another part of the polluting fossil fuel industry is shutting down simply because it no longer has a business case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Coming quickly off the back of the news that Huntly will be closing its smoke belching coal boilers, Contact's announcement that Otahuhu fossil fuel powered gas plant will be switched off to be replaced by cleaner, smarter power shows that these outdated power stations have had their day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The writing is on the wall: renewable energy is better for jobs, the bottom line, and the air we breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But instead of backing New Zealand’s clean energy industries, John Key’s government continues its love affair with some of the most polluting industries on the planet. They’re ignoring the tens of thousands of jobs that could be provided, and the multi-billion dollar economic boost these cutting edge technologies could provide and instead doing all they can to drag foreign oil companies over here.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Meeting in Busan, South Korea this week, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) agreed to an unacceptably high limit on the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs), essentially maintaining the interest of the Spanish fishing industry. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Busan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Meeting in Busan, South Korea this week, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) agreed to an unacceptably high limit on the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs), essentially maintaining the interest of the Spanish fishing industry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The IOTC agreed to allow 550 FADs per vessel. Which means that industry operators who use excessive numbers of FADs, mostly from Spain and France, are allowed to continue their FAD-dependent operations, and some fleets can even increase their use of destructive FADs and therefore the fishing capacity of any purse seine fleet in the region. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In response to the agreement,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Francois Chartier of Greenpeace France said, "this is further expansion of FAD use dressed up as FAD control, and is further evidence of the failure of the IOTC to manage this serious and rapidly growing problem. Worse still, it completely undermines the voluntary commitment made by the French fleet to limit their own FAD use."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The agreement demonstrated that the European Union supported the interest of a handful of industrial companies from Spain supported by the French industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"This is beyond unacceptable,” said Lagi Toribau, Greenpeace spokesperson at the meeting. “This Commission has allowed FADs to expand uncontrolled for over a decade. The fact there has been absolutely no management framework in place for the use of FADs, makes it crucial that the market and consumers demand sustainably caught tuna that is FAD free and IUU free". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Tuna fishing capacity continues to increase globally, and the construction of new purse seiners and the proliferation of FADs means a large increase in the efficiency of tuna fleets targeting tropical tunas, which puts tuna resources at an ever-increasing risk. Compounding the risk is an increasing level of IUU fishing, and the failure by countries fishing in the Indian Ocean to submit the data needed to assess stock status, which means science-based decisions at the IOTC are compromised and politics takes precedence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="justify"&gt;“&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The continued proliferation in FADs used by purse seine fleets is creating an environment in which free-school fishing, a cleaner fishing method, is becoming increasingly difficult. The agreement disadvantages all but the largest and most industrialized vessels, which will be best equipped to catch an excessive share of the world's tropical tuna catch, along with increasing amounts of juvenile tuna. This agreement shows the IOTC endorsing a drive to out-compete smaller and more sustainable operators. This move must be opposed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;by the entire tuna industry, by other nations, and by responsible traders, retailers and consumers of tuna products,” concludes Toribau, ‘or there will be no fish left to argue over.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	People-power is our not-so-secret weapon in making companies and governments do the right thing. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace asks people to add their voices, their actions &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/blog/chuggers-or-everyday-heroes/blog/53751/"&gt;and their money&lt;/a&gt; to give our campaigns the biggest possible impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re absolutely independent - politically and financially. And we’re proud of that. It enables us to campaign on areas that are of the most concern, and in ways that will be the most effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We try to be completely transparent about our approach to asking people for support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don’t ask for or accept any money from companies or governments. We only take money from individual people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s why we care so much about getting our communications with people right. We set high standards, we train all our fundraisers, we have clear policies about not approaching young or vulnerable people, we monitor what’s done and we take swift action on the rare occasions when things don’t meet our standards. We don’t pretend to be perfect and we’re constantly looking at ways to improve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is our promise to you, our supporters:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We never sell or swap your details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We only call people who have signed up to our work or agreed to be contacted by us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We restrict the number of phone calls asking for money to two a year and always listen if it’s not a convenient time to speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you tell us you don’t want to be contacted again, we don’t contact you again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/Help/privacy/"&gt;Here's our full privacy policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Today sees another damning report on the deteriorating health of NZ’s environment.
The Ministry for the Environment has released Our Land 2018 which reveals that the large scale conversion and intensification of dairying is a key driver of environmental degradation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.mpi.govt.nz/news-and-resources/science-and-research/land-use-change-report/"&gt;This report&lt;/a&gt; should be a serious wake-up call," says Greenpeace sustainable agriculture campaigner, Gen Toop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are too many cows. We urgently need to diversify and transition away from intensive dairying."The report found that the "intensification of farming is increasing pressure on the environment".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It states: "Farming is considered to be intensifying when the amount of agricultural inputs going into the farm are increasing per hectare of land. Inputs include water, feed, agri-chemicals, and livestock numbers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also found that NZ is losing 192 million tonnes of soil a year into our waterways and into the ocean. 44% of this, 84 million tonnes, is coming from pastoral farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Healthy soil is the key to healthy rivers, healthy people and a healthy planet" says Toop."The industrial way are farming is literally squandering soil, which we ultimately depend on to grow food and sustain life"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other key finding include: 83% of our indigenous land vertebrates are threatened with extinction and rare wetlands and other rare indigenous ecosystems continue to be destroyed.&lt;br&gt;"NZ is in a worsening freshwater crisis, our soils are degrading, our emissions increasing and we are continuing to lose our precious wetlands, native forests and tussock lands. 8 out of ten of our indigenous land vertebrates are now threatened with extinction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This Government must take urgent action to curb cow numbers and shift New Zealand agriculture away from destructive industrial practices and towards regenerative farming."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Regenerative farming is the future for farming in NZ and it is already being practiced by innovative farmers around the country."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently Patagonia released an international regenerative organic certification, although this has yet to be adopted in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Regenerative farming is a way of farming that treats a farm like a healthy ecosystem rather than a factory. It does away with environmentally damaging inputs and has been shown to be able to rebuild healthy soil, reduce pollution, sequester the carbon that causes climate change and protect biodiversity."&lt;/p&gt;

This will see more areas of New Zealand’s ocean being opened up to mostly foreign oil drillers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The offers are likely to include hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of our ocean territory off the West Coast of the North Island, stretching from Taranaki to beyond Northland as well as large offshore tracts of the East Coast of the North and South Islands, from Hawke’s Bay to south of Bluff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groups such as Greenpeace New Zealand, 350 Aotearoa, Kiwis Against Seabed Mining and Oil Free Auckland have joined together to organise the march against deep sea drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate and energy spokesperson Steve Abel says the drums were a symbol of the harmful seismic blasts that are created by ships prospecting for oil in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blasts, which can be heard from over 100km away, are the first step of oil exploration, and involve a ship firing off repeated seismic booms from underwater airguns every few seconds, day and night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even though the blasting is known to distress marine mammals, it’s being carried out right now over huge tracts of ocean and very close to the habitat of the critically endangered Maui’s Dolphin,” Abel says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep sea drilling also risks a catastrophic oil spill that could irreparably damage our oceans, coasts, economy and way of life, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry standard oil spill modelling shows that a deep sea oil blowout could devastate New Zealand’s coastlines, with Auckland’s West Coast beaches such as Piha and Muriwai potentially being some of the worst affected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also universally accepted that up to 80% of the fossil fuels on the books today can never be burnt if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niamh O’Flynn of 350 Aotearoa says we must listen to the warnings of leading scientists around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They’re saying we must urgently move away from burning oil and towards clean energy if we want to reduce the extreme droughts, storms and food shortages that climate change is bringing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Key’s continued backing for intensive dairy irrigation schemes, which will increase pollution of New Zealand’s rivers and streams, means he is unfit for the tourism job, claims Greenpeace.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“John Key should resign as minister of tourism. Any tourism minister worth their salt would be doing all they could to halt the pollution of our rivers and streams. But Key’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He should stop throwing millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money at these irrigation schemes right now, and bring them to a halt. That would be great news for our tourism industry, and to everyone who likes swimming in clean rivers and lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But his continued refusal to do so is threatening our huge tourism industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Key’s failing to do his job as minister of tourism. He should do the right thing and resign the position immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Clean, green farming is much better for our finances, our farmers and our international reputation, on which our tourism industry relies. It’s this that the government should be backing, not irrigation schemes which pollute our rivers and threaten our economy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This morning the Tourism Export Council called for a five-year ban on new irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government currently has around $120million of taxpayers’ money sitting in a fund, called Crown Irrigation Investments, which is earmarked for controversial irrigation schemes designed to expand industrial dairy agriculture. The government hopes to increase the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on these schemes to $400million.&lt;/p&gt;

	Press release from Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, Greenpeace, Kiwis Against Seabed Mining

Protected corals could be wiped out by deep sea phosphate mining, hearing told
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Wellington-30 September 2014—Mining phosphate from the seabed of the Chatham Rise would remove a protected coral species crucial to the local ecosystem, an Environmental Protection Agency hearing into a seabed mining proposal was told this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benthic expert Professor Les Watling, a marine biologist with extensive experience – to the point of having seven new species named in his honour - was giving evidence on behalf of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC), Greenpeace and Kiwis Against Seabed mining (KASM) to the hearing into Chatham Rock Phosphate’s (CRP) application to mine a 5000 sq km area of the Chatham Rise for phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s sediment modelling shows that the mining waste would consist of small particles that, if pumped back into the water, would spread over a wide area. This, Professor Watling said, would create a kind of “soup” where no coral could grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coral, Goniocorella dumosa, was a protected species under the Wildlife Act, and “one of the most important structure-forming, and thus habitat-creating, species on the Chatham Rise,” he said. It was the dominant coral in the area and was the reason it is a “sensitive environment” under the EEZ Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mining company suggested that artificial ‘substrate’ like concrete blocks could be placed, but Professor Watling calculated that it would take 164 million concrete blocks to cover only 20 per cent of the mined area, he said, making it prohibitively expensive, and nobody knew if the idea would work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSCC spokesperson Barry Weeber noted that Chatham Rock Phosphate had admitted on Friday that placing these blocks could cost $20 billion and render the entire project uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pointed to the international protocols around the effect of another destructive practice – bottom trawling – on these sensitive ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International protocols aimed at avoiding all significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems. Yet this seabed mining proposal would see deliberate targeting of areas containing these vulnerable ecosystems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace believes that individual and corporate consumers have the right and responsibility to buy wood and wood-based products which do not contribute to environmental and social degradation. Replacements already exist for virtually every form of wood product from ancient forests, from building construction to product packaging.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/External/image/2006/7/FSC-wood-Brazil.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/Small/Global/new-zealand/External/image/2006/7/FSC-wood-Brazil.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;

            Sustainably harvested wood bearing the Forest Stewardship Council logo.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the ability to help save our ancient forests. If you are buying timber, or wood products, and suspect it has come from an ancient forest please do not buy it. If you are going to buy timber that may have come from an ancient forest, please get proof from the retailer that it is Forest Stewardship Council certified timber before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if it's forest-friendly? The only way to ensure that wood products from the Paradise Forests, the Amazon and other ancient forests are coming from legal and well-managed forests is to demand all products come from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified forests. Insist the product has an FSC label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If FSC timber is not available please choose plantation wood such as NZ grown eucalyptus, cypresses, mahogany from Fiji, or rubberwood from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological and socially responsible forest management can, and is, being practiced worldwide. However, it is the exception rather than the rule and ancient forests continue to be at risk from accelerating rates of destructive and illegal logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong public demand and pressure from non-governmental organisations, combined with real commitments from corporate buyers to purchase products only from FSC certified forests, is one solution to help stop ancient forest destruction and promote ecologically and socially responsible management of the world's forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the FSC?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an international, non-profit association founded in 1993 through the efforts of more than one hundred participants representing economic, social, indigenous and environmental interests from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC is a scheme that issues certificates for well-managed forests and was created to provide the means for corporate buyers and the public to identify products coming from responsiblly managed forests, with the aim to create the economic incentives for wider application in the market place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecologically responsible forest management, such as that required by the FSC, seeks to ensure that the forest ecosystem is not damaged and only low volumes of trees that can be sustained by the forest are extracted. The impacts on the plant and animal life in the forest from this method of logging must be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSC certification means that the forest has been independently inspected and evaluated for compliance with local laws, respect for indigenous and traditional people's rights, the health, safety and rights of forest workers, and the provision of a wide range of social benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Members of the FSC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC has grown rapidly since its inception and there are now FSC endorsed certifications and working groups in all major forest production regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its members include some large important players such as Sweden's Assi Doman (the worlds largest private landowner), Home Depot and B&amp;amp;Q (the largest do-it-yourself chains in the US and UK respectively), as well as many smaller companies, community forestry groups, indigenous peoples organisations, unions and environmental organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a founding member of the FSC and is active in its development at both the international, national and regional levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General &lt;a href="http://www.fsc.org/en/"&gt;Forest Stewardship Ccouncil website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search the &lt;a href="http://info.fsc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;FSC international member and product database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy wood and it's from ancient forests - whether it's building timber, furniture or musical instruments - buy forest friendly, or don't buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

	The owner of international pet food giant Whiskas have admitted that questions over their links to modern-day slavery are ‘very worrying’.

 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This month, Greenpeace New Zealand launched an international campaign against the well-known cat food brand, saying that cat owners who buy Whiskas for their pet may unwittingly be funding human rights abuses, as  fish used to feed moggies may have been caught by slaves and sold to Mars, Whiskas’ parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most famous for peddling chocolate bars, Mars is also the largest pet food company on the planet. The American company buys tuna and other seafood that goes into its cat food pouches and cans from Thai Union, one of the world’s biggest seafood exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Thai Union was connected to human rights abuses through direct links to fishing vessels where workers were exploited, abused and forced to work without getting off the ship for years at a time. Thai Union also sources from fishing methods that result in high catches of untargeted species, such as sharks, turtles and rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of concerned people have already written to Mars expressing concern that the company may be feeding cats tuna caught using destructive fishing methods, forced labour or an abused workforce. And over 250,000 people have watched an online video featuring some of the most famous cats on the internet asking for cat food to be free of links to modern-day slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In correspondence to Greenpeace New Zealand addressing the slavery scandal, Mars admitted that the American company ‘works with several suppliers in Thailand and Thai Union is one of them. Therefore the recent allegations….are very worrying and raise our concerns.’ Mars also confessed that ‘we do not have all the answers needed at this point in time’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiskas also recently tweeted from their @whiskas_uk account to say: ‘We’re concerned about the potential forced labour practices in areas of the supply chain where we lack direct visibility’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an exposé last year, products from another Mars-owned cat food brand, Iams, were shown to be made in a Thai Union cannery which was processing fish from boats using trafficked and forced labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand have contacted Mars in New Zealand several times in the last few months, asking the company to provide evidence that they are not selling Whiskas cat food tainted by human rights abuses and destructive fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Kate Simcock said: “Whiskas are clearly unable to deny that their cat food contains fish that has been caught by slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company have expressed concern and admitted there are huge areas of their supply chains over which they have no visibility. And instead of acting now to sort this out, they’re going to wait a whole year while they write a report about where their seafood comes from. That’s simply not good enough. Cat lovers will surely be shocked by this. No-one wants to buy cat food, or anything else for that matter, that reeks of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whiskas have a very murky supply chain that almost certainly has seafood linked to modern-day slavery in it. And they’ve got to clean it up. The company should be developing and implementing a comprehensive, time-bound plan that ensures they no longer buy seafood that has been tainted with both human rights and environmental abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over three months ago, Nestle, which owns Purina and Fancy Feast, admitted that its pet food products have been linked to human rights abuses and promised to clean up its supply chain. Nestle claims that all companies sourcing seafood from Thailand will face the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	During the production of the 2015 Greenpeace USA calendar, the publisher, Workman Publishing, sourced an image from a nature photographer, Alain Mafart-Renodier. It was later discovered that Mafart-Renodier is also Alain Mafart, one of the French military operatives who was involved in the bombing of the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, in New Zealand in 1985. He was part of the team that bombed our ship and killed our colleague and friend, Fernando Pereira, a Greenpeace commissioned photographer.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Neither Workman nor &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace USA&lt;/a&gt; staff realized there was a problem until after production was complete and the calendars had been distributed to retailers. As soon as we were alerted to the problem, we contacted Workman to request a complete recall of the calendars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We made the recall request in consideration of the feelings of Fernando’s family and our supporters. It is wrong and upsetting that a picture from Mafart could ever appear anywhere in a Greenpeace publication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Workman Publishing would not even consider our request that the company immediately issue a recall for the calendars it had sent to retailers unless the organization agreed to reimburse Workman an estimated minimum amount of $250,000 USD for its costs and lost profits.  In addition, there was no way to guarantee a complete recall because retailers would not have to comply and some of the calendars would likely have been sold before a recall could take effect.  We determined that this was not the best use of our donors’ money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, we have returned all royalty payments for the 2015 calendar we received from Workman. Greenpeace will not be making any money from this calendar. We have also decided to end our business relationship with Workman and the company will not be producing future Greenpeace calendars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calendars already in possession of Greenpeace will not be distributed and will be recycled. We are currently working on an alternative version that we will distribute to supporters that will feature photography by Fernando Pereira as a tribute to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We deeply regret this error and are frustrated and upset that we were not able to secure a complete recall of our 2015 calendar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Mining phosphate on the Chatham Rise, off the east coast of New Zealand’s south island,  could potentially have many impacts on marine mammals like whales and dolphins, the Environmental Protection Agency was told today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite these potential threats, the company had carried out no visual or acoustic surveys to establish what whales were in the vicinity, and there was no empirical data on noise that would be generated by the mining.   Instead, CRP contractors had constructed a model extrapolating noise from a shallow-water mining operation, a model that, for example, did not take into account noise from pipes taking sediment 450 metres up to the ship - or back down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “There are a number of potentially serious impacts on marine mammals.  More rigorous environmental impact assessment would be needed to assess the severity of the impacts of this development,” said Ms Slooten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine mammal species known to use the Chatham rise area include blue whales, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, dusky dolphins, false killer whales, humpback whales, killer whales, minke whales, pilot whales, sei whales, southern right whales, sperm whales and NZ fur seals, plus the species group beaked whales, according to Slooten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; However, there was also a need to understand the number of any of these marine mammals in this area, which simply hadn’t been studied properly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “From a scientific point of view, three years of baseline monitoring is the minimum required to collect baseline data on distribution and abundance of marine mammals and this is also the minimum to provide a realistic chance of detecting effects on other species,” she said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; None of this work had been done by the company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatham Rock Phosphate Ltd has applied to New Zealand’s Environmental Protection Authority for a marine consent to carry out seabed mining on the Chatham Rise, between New Zealand’s South Islands and the Chatham Islands, in waters about 450 metres deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application is heard by a 5-member Decision-Making Committee. All documents are &lt;a href="http://kasm.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=40fd433e2f2344060946f0bb8&amp;amp;id=acd127f3d4&amp;amp;e=5f2795a2c9" target="_blank"&gt;on the EPA website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hearing will take nine weeks and is expected to conclude on 20th November. A decision is expected by late December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenpeace, the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition and Kiwis Against Seabed Mining (KASM) have formed a coalition to oppose the application. The coalition has called evidence on benthic (seafloor life) effects (Prof. Les Watling from the University of Hawaii), marine mammals (Assoc. Prof. Liz Slooten from the University of Otago), toxic effects (Assoc. Prof. Barrie Peake from the University of Otago) and regulation of radiation (Dr David Santillo), since the phosphate to be mined has a high proportion of uranium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace calls on the (WCPFC) Western and Central Fisheries Commission’s Technical and Compliance Committee to take a tough stance to prevent the collapse of tuna stocks. Recent critical declines of Pacific tuna stocks are a direct result of the continued expansion of fleets, fishing effort and FAD use, by countries fishing for Pacific tuna. Overfishing in the region is not only an environmental disaster, it is economically self-defeating.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In Pohnpei for the Committee meeting this week,Greenpeace’s Karli Thomas says, “The WCPFC and its members must respond strongly to any breach of the rules. If they don’t, overfishing will continue and bring with it fisheries collapse, bankruptcies and job losses.” The need to improve governance of Pacific tuna fisheries has been reinforced by the revelations in China Tuna Industries’(CTI) draft prospectus for an initial public offer on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.The Deutsche Bank sponsored IPO draft prospectus conveys a blatant disregard for the long term health of fish stocks and for the catch limits imposed by the WCPFC to recover the overfished bigeye stock. “The company’s statements around compliance and penalties under the WCPFC read like a slap in the face for the Commission,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company describes bigeye tuna in the region as being at “a healthy level of abundance”, the WCPFC’s own science&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the stock is overfished and at a critically low level requiring immediate action. Last week, Greenpeace wrote to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to raise concern about this and other inaccuracies in the draft prospectus. Media has since reported that the company is delaying its IPO as a result of those concerns&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its briefing paper to the meeting&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Greenpeace calls on the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee to recommend that the Commission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen the Commission’s response to non-compliance and IUU fishing, including by developing and enforcing sanctions for non-compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce longline fishing effort including closing the high seas to all fishing, banning transshipment at sea and placing more observers on longliners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease purse seine impacts on bigeye tuna by adopting a permanent year-round ban on the use of FADs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt interim target reference points of 50% for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna stocks, and 70% for albacore, to guide management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agree a Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific albacore, based on the Atafu Declaration made by Pacific leaders in 2014&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen rules to prevent sharks being targeted and adopt international best practice (fins naturally attached landings) to combat shark finning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s 11th Regular Session will be held in Samoa in December 2014, where decisions will be made for management of Pacific tunas in 2015 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All countries and companies involved in Pacific tuna fisheries must have the health of the stocks as their primary concern. China Tuna Industry’s attitude is one of brazen disregard for the sorry state of bigeye tuna, and for the limits in place to protect the species. WCPFC members must insist that for the tuna industry to have a future, there is no place for companies that are not committed to fishing sustianably and legally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a future where tuna is a global scale fishery that protects biodiversity, provides employment and income, and feeds people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Beijing, 26 January 2015 – For the first time this century, China’s coal consumption appears to have fallen in 2014, according to a new projection from China National Coal Association [1] and recent economic and energy related statistics. Coal consumption growth has been slowing down and decoupling from economic growth since 2012 [2]. China’s coal consumption growth was responsible for more than half of global CO2 emission growth in the past 10 years.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;Fang Yuan, spokesperson at Greenpeace East Asia said:&lt;br style="outline-style: none;"&gt;"The fact that China's coal consumption finally starts to decouple from its GDP growth, shows that a peak in coal use is within reach. With political determination on an energy revolution, and strong targets and measures, the peak can be realized well before 2020. This is not only critical for China to win the battle against air pollution, but will also speed us towards a global CO2 emissions peak."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;A number of factors contributed to the reduction in coal consumption last year: rapid increase in renewable power generating capacity, shift of economic growth from heavy industry towards new economy sectors, energy efficiency improvements in power generation and industry, and good hydropower conditions being among the most important. China achieved record increases in grid-connected wind power capacity (20 gigawatts) and solar (11 gigawatts), and continued to add hydropower capacity at a fast rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;Ambitious policies to control coal use, spurred by the air pollution crisis, along with policies to diversify the economy away from energy-intensive industries, are strongly constraining coal consumption. The final nail in the coffin for unbridled growth of China's coal consumption came in late 2014. China appears to have dramatically cut down its ambitions for coal-to-gas and other coal conversion projects – the last potential source of rapid coal demand growth, due to concerns about water impacts and economic viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;Greenpeace analysis [3] indicates that full implementation of China's existing energy targets, including targets for renewable energy and controlling total energy consumption, can achieve the coal peak before 2020. Greenpeace is calling for this to be made an official target in China's Five Year Plan for 2016-2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;In another important positive development, China recently required four provinces in the key economic regions to set absolute coal consumption reduction targets, in addition to four others that already have ambitious targets. These provinces consume over 600 million metric tons of coal per year, almost as much as India as a whole. They have already had an obligation to achieve negative growth of coal consumption by 2017, but the requirement for numeric targets is a clear step up in terms of ambition and accountability. China coal imports also slumped by 35.8 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="outline-style: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; color: #0e0f0e; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"&gt;"End of China's coal boom is evident.

&lt;p&gt;During the three-month 'Defending Our Pacific' expedition, the  Esperanza monitored the Pacific Commons and visited Pago Pago in  American Samoa, Nauru, and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. In  December, Greenpeace and the government of Palau conducted a joint  fisheries enforcement operation in Palau's national waters. Greenpeace  assisted in apprehending and detaining a licensed vessel engaged in  illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, failing to report via its  vessel monitoring system and catching and finning sharks, a practice  banned in Palauan waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza encountered 63 fishing vessels in total during the  expedition, including an overt, illegal, stateless and unmarked purse  seine vessel operating with six other support vessels in what appeared  to be a group operation. Fishing vessels were also sighted transiting  through Pacific countries' waters. Catches of sharks were particularly  high on a number of vessels; in several cases the Esperanza crew took  action, inspecting and documenting vessels at the invitation of their  captains, and releasing endangered species and other bycatch from tuna  longline hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The expedition showed that longline fishing in the Pacific Commons remains rampant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Beijing / Hong Kong, 15 October 2014 – The Chinese government has criticized as “misleading” a bungled initial public offering (IPO) that Deutsche Bank organised for one of China’s largest tuna longline companies. The IPO has been suspended after Greenpeace exposed serious material omissions in China Tuna Industry Group’s (CTI) preliminary prospectus to raise US$150 million, which was to be used to expand its fishing of vulnerable tuna species in the Pacific Ocean.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;Greenpeace has written to Deutsche Bank [1], seeking clarification about its relationship with CTI, how it allowed the deal to go ahead in the first place, and asking the bank to withdraw from the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;“Overfishing is business suicide for fishing companies, and a risk to investors. This scandal is a warning to financial institutions like Deutsche Bank, and investors in the fishing sector not to risk their reputations by dealing with companies that pillage our oceans. We wait to hear how Deutsche Bank intends to fix its social and environmental risk framework, a framework that should have prevented the IPO application from happening in the first place,” said Elsa Lee, Senior Business Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;CTI hoped to use the money from the share offering to expand its longline fleet targeting bigeye tuna in the Pacific Ocean, but the IPO was postponed after Greenpeace exposed significant investor risk to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The draft prospectus understated the supply risk to investors, citing an outdated stock assessment for the now overfished bigeye tuna and revealing a business plan based on ignoring catch limits and penalties set by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;In a reply letter to Greenpeace, dated 30 September, China’s Bureau of Fisheries confirmed it is conducting an internal investigation into CTI. The Bureau of Fisheries stated that, “The (draft) prospectus has gravely misled investors and the international community, and caused a tremendous negative impact.”[2] Threatening further action, the Bureau states “…the company's actions are already in violation of relevant laws and regulations.” The Bureau has called on Dalian Ocean Fishing Company Ltd, the fishing subsidiary of CTI, to halt any attempts to list its offshore fisheries businesses, and to account to the Bureau on how it is handing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;“Greenpeace welcomes this strong stand from the Chinese government. It is now crucial that we prevent deals that fuel any increased overfishing in distant waters from happening. As a first step, we urge the financial sector, including Deutsche Bank, to remove itself from unsustainable business such as CTI,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="western" lang="en-GB"&gt;Much of the global longline fleet operates out of control and out of sight. Over 5000 vessels roam the oceans with little controls to ensure they are fishing legally, sustainably, or ethically. There is huge bycatch of endangered marine animals as well as serious overfishing, and depletion of species such as yellowfin, albacore, bluefin, and bigeye – the species primarily fished by CTI.&lt;/p&gt;

This report takes a look at the energy choices some of the largest and fastest growing IT companies are making, as the race to build "the cloud" creates a new era of technology.

&lt;p&gt;As one of the fastest growing sectors, both economically and in their energy consumption, global IT companies and cloud computing companies have a tremendous opportunity and unique responsibility to take greater control of their electricity supply chain, and to manage their energy ecosystem both outside and inside the data centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making better energy choices and demanding more from utility vendors, cloud companies have the opportunity to be a catalyst in driving utilities and governments toward the development of cleaner electricity generation that will ensure a truly green cloud for their long-term sustainability – and a greener grid for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

	Palau, 8 December 2011 - Palauan fisheries officials have boarded and detained a Taiwanese fishing vessel suspected of illegal fishing activities during a joint patrol with Greenpeace of the Pacific Island nation’s exclusive economic zone.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Esperanza and the Palauan patrol boat, PSS President H.I. Remeliik, are currently escorting the vessel Sheng Chi Hui to port. A Greenpeace helicopter flight spotted the sharks and fins on board the Sheng Chi Hui on the morning of December 8th, while the fishing vessel was inside Palaun waters – which were declared a shark sanctuary in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Sheng Chi Hui was in apparent breach of the law here in Palau’s exclusive economic zone. Illegal fishing is costing the future of our people, our country’s economic development and is a threat to the future of the legitimate fishing industry. It must be stopped,” said Palau President Johnson Toribiong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Government of Palau signed a joint agreement earlier this week to both enforce fisheries regulations and bring illegal pirate fishing operations to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are honored to be working with Greenpeace in the protection of our fisheries resources and securing the livelihood and future of our people. Let this be a warning to illegal operators,” President Toribiong continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 21 per cent and 46 per cent of all fishing in the Western Central Pacific Ocean is thought to be Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU)[1]. The illegal plunder of fish from the Pacific is putting the region’s food security and economic prosperity at risk. Like most Pacific Island countries Palau must patrol vast territorial waters with very limited capacity; it has one patrol boat and more than 604,000 km2 of ocean to patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Illegal fishing carried on by vessels like the Sheng Chi Hui is rampant in parts of the Pacific, with the slaughter of sharks and the theft of tuna occurring on a daily basis”, said Lagi Toribau, Greenpeace campaign leader on board the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this continues, we will see a Pacific region with empty nets, empty plates and empty bellies. We applaud the Palauan government for taking a stand and enforcing its laws. Now we are calling on the Taiwanese government - as the responsible flag state - to better regulate its fishing industry”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sheng Chi Hui will undergo further investigation by Palauan officials on its arrival in the country.Yesterday, officials from the Remeliik boarded an unlicensed Philippine flagged reefer, F-B Yanreyd 291, confiscated its fishing gear and catch and escorted it out of Palau’s waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s "Defending Our Pacific" tour is campaigning to prevent the plunder of Pacific tuna and for the restoration of the health of the world's oceans through the creation of marine reserves. The international environment group is calling for marine reserves to be established in four high seas pockets of the Pacific Commons, and be declared off limits to fishing. The environmental group is also seeking a ban on the use of FADs in purse seine fisheries and a 50 per cent reduction across entire tuna fisheries.  These measures are important to keep valuable fish stocks at a sustainable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans and for a more sustainable fishing industry, both necessary steps to restoring our oceans to health. Around the world, Greenpeace is working with retailers and tuna brands across Europe, Australia and the Americas to increase the market share of sustainably-sourced tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

	International waters, 25 November, 2011 – Activists from the Greenpeace ship Esperanza have demonstrated against tuna vessels operating illegally in an area known as the Pacific Commons (1) near Indonesia.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An unnamed purse seine vessel with no flag or nationality but with Filipino crew was caught illegally transshipping its tuna catch to a carrier vessel, the Lapu Lapu. The vessels were found by Greenpeace in an area which has been closed to purse seine fishing by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) (2) and Pacific Island nations’ governments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is outrageous and completely unacceptable that these vessels and their owners violated efforts by the region to protect their tuna stocks, key to their food security and economic prosperity,” said Greenpeace Australia Pacific oceans campaigner Lagi Toribau on board the Esperanza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pirate fishing is known to be particularly rampant in high seas areas like the Pacific Commons where monitoring and surveillance is difficult. It is estimated between 21-46% of all fish caught in the Pacific is taken by pirate fishing ships such as this (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We call on the members of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to take action against these vessels, prosecute their owners and blacklist them from further fishing. In addition, seafood companies must end their complicity in this kind of crime by refusing to source tuna from the Pacific Commons,” said Toribau.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists have also removed three illegal Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) found in the area. Greenpeace is calling for a ban on FADs being used by purse seiners as the method catches and kills other sea life including threatened sharks, juvenile tuna and even the occasional turtle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week Greenpeace released a video showing shocking images of whales, a marlin and a ray dying on the decks of tuna boats due to this destructive fishing method. The video has reached a global audience with close to 90,000 views in eight days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the same indiscriminate fishing method used by the fishing fleets that supply Sealord, New Zealand's biggest canned tuna brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner Karli Thomas said the use of this destructive fishing practices by the tuna industry resulted in about 200,000 tonnes of bycatch globally each year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That’s the equivalent of more than one billion cans of bycatch needlessly destroyed every year (4).” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As New Zealand’s largest supplier of canned tuna Sealord should be ashamed to be associated with such an indiscriminate and wasteful form of fishing.  While Sealord defends purse seine fishing with FADs their competitor Pams has become a sustainability market leader in New Zealand by switching to FAD-free and pole and line caught tuna.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Banning FADs in purse seine fisheries is an important step towards protecting the Pacific from an indiscriminate plunder that is threatening tuna stocks and the region's food security and economic prosperity.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace ship Esperanza is currently on an expedition "Defending Our Pacific", part of the organisation's campaign to save Pacific tuna by ending the use of destructive fishing practices, halting pirate fishing and creating marine reserves in the Pacific&lt;br&gt;Commons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With tuna stocks in other oceans now depleted, fishing fleets from Asia, USA, and Europe have turned their attention to the Pacific, the source of more than half of all tuna consumed globally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MEDIA CONTACTS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiller MacDuff, on board the Esperanza, +47 2367 7986&lt;br&gt;Karli Thomas, Greenpace NZ oceans campaigner,  021 90 5582      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For photo and video contact Steve Smith, Greenpeace International Communications: +668 1298707&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/pacific-tuna-need-marine-reserves/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Also referred to as the Tuna Commission, WCPFC is an&lt;br&gt;intergovernmental body governing fisheries in the Pacific,&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wcpfc.int/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wcpfc.int/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) &lt;a href="http://www.mrag.co.uk/Documents/ExtentGlobalIllegalFishing.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mrag.co.uk/Documents/ExtentGlobalIllegalFishing.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) 202,782.3 tonnes of bycatch.

	Tauranga 19 October 2011: The skipper of the te Whānau-ā-Apanui-owned fishing boat the San Pietro, which took part in the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla earlier this year, appeared in the same court in Tauranga this morning as the Rena’s Captain and Second Officer, who have been charged with the same offences. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The charge of Dangerous Activity Involving a Ship, under section 65 of the Maritime Transport Act, and of resisting arrest, under the Summary Offences Act, came after Teddy’s arrest in April. The Te Whānau-ā-Apanui fishing crew had set their nets in front of a Petrobras-contracted oil survey ship, telling them they weren’t welcome and that: “We will not be moving … we will be doing some fishing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teddy’s case has been adjourned, because of a lack of disclosure by the Crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elvis has reportedly been charged with the same offence as the Rena’s Captain and Second Officer, but Elvis was trying to prevent deep sea oil drilling, spilling, and killing of our coastline. Those running the Rena caused what we have tried to prevent,” says Dayle Takitimu, spokesperson for te Whānau-ā-Apanui. “This is exactly what the Government promised couldn’t happen and they need to be called to account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teddy’s appearance came as oil from the Rena washes up in the heart of te Whānau-ā-Apanui’s coastal area at Te Kaha and Waihau  Bay, made famous in the movie ‘Boy.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oil spills, whether from the Rena or from a deep sea oil well, are a threat both to te Whānau-ā-Apanui’s way of life, and to the way of life of all people up and down this coast,” says Takitimu. “We must all take a stand to prevent the unnecessary risk of deep sea oil drilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Argent, Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner, says that: “The Rena spill is a warning to us all of how difficult it is to deal with even a small oil spill. As serious as the Rena spill is, a Gulf of Mexico-type blowout from a Petrobras deep water exploratory rig in the Raukumara  Basin, would be far worse. The Deepwater Horizon spilt 682,000 metric tonnes of oil, before it was plugged. The Rena has so far spilt an estimated 350 tonnes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While BP’s exploratory rig was operating in 1500 metres of water, Petrobras surveyed down to depths of 3100 metres – a depth that the company’s permit allows it to drill its exploratory wells in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At most, a diver could only descend to 200 metres to fix a problem with a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While Greenpeace are among those helping remove oil from the Bay of Plenty coastline, it has to be acknowledged that a real ‘clean-up,’ in the sense of recovering all the oil and returning beaches to the way they were, is impossible. Mitigation is all that can be done once oil enters the water, regardless of however many regulations, or whatever equipment, may or may not be on hand,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prevention is the best way to stop a spill, and that means putting a stop to plans for deep sea oil drilling off New   Zealand’s shores,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 17 November 2011 - Greenpeace today released shocking footage and images of whales and a marlin and ray dying at the hands of industrial tuna fishers in the Pacific Ocean (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The footage was shot by a New Zealand helicopter pilot turned whistleblower, who undertook aerial reconnaissance for a small fleet of tuna boats in the Pacific in 2009. To protect the pilot from reprisals Greenpeace has disguised his identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filming secretly the pilot documented marine life being hauled on deck dead or dying, after being caught in purse seine nets set around fish aggregation devices (FADs). FADs are used by the fishing industry to attract tuna, however they also attract a whole range of other marine life – like the whales shown in the footage - which is then scooped up by fishing nets.

In addition, this method of fishing also results in substantial catches of undersized tuna. “This can represent from 15-20% of a purse seine FAD set catch.’ (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the huge volumes of tuna caught in the Pacific these bycatch rates equate to shameful amounts of marine species being killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas continues, “About 200,000 tonnes of this bycatch is caught annually by the global tuna industry’s destructive practices. That’s the equivalent of more than one billion cans of bycatch needlessly destroyed every year (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace launched a campaign in April urging New Zealand’s five main tuna brands to stop sourcing tuna caught using the combination of FADs and purse seine nets. Soon after Foodstuffs announced most of its Pams brand tuna would be sourced from pole and line or FAD-free fisheries by the end of the 2011 (4). Foodstuffs has confirmed FAD free tuna is now available in its South Island and Wellington supermarkets and will soon be on sale in the Auckland region (5). Last month Greenseas, owned by Heinz in Australia, committed to phase out FAD caught tuna by 2015 (6).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As New Zealand’s largest supplier of canned tuna Sealord should be ashamed to be involved with unsustainable tuna fishing.  While Sealord defends indiscriminate FAD fishing their competitor Pams has become a market leader in tuna sustainability in New Zealand by switching to FAD-free and pole and line caught tuna,” says Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Banning FADs in purse seine fisheries is an important step towards protecting the Pacific from destructive tuna fishing which is threatening tuna stocks and the region's food security and economic prosperity.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) The video can be viewed here: http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/tunavideo/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Page 10 ISSF report http://iss-foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/05/FAD-document.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) 202,782.3 tonnes of bycatch.

	Auckland, 2 December 2011 - A New Zealand whistleblower’s shocking footage of marine life dying at the hands of industrial tuna fishers in the Pacific Ocean has gained a global audience.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Youtube video has had more than 114,000 views since it was released by Greenpeace two weeks ago. It shows whales, marlin and a ray killed as a result of a fishing method which catches far more than just tuna. The video release has received media coverage in Australia, Asia, Europe, the USA and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video can be viewed here: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/tunavideo/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/tunavideo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are outraged by the obscene waste of ocean life shown in this footage,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New Zealand helicopter pilot shot the gruesome scenes while working as a spotter for tuna boats in the Pacific in 2009. To protect him from reprisals Greenpeace has disguised his identity. The vessels were using a destructive fishing method where fish aggregation devices (FADs) are used to lure tuna but also attracted a range of other creatures which are then caught in purse seine nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same destructive fishing method used by the fishing fleets that supply Sealord, New Zealand's biggest canned tuna brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas says about 200,000 tonnes of this bycatch is caught annually by the global tuna industry’s destructive practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the equivalent of more than one billion cans of bycatch needlessly destroyed every year (1).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April Greenpeace launched a campaign urging New Zealand’s five main tuna brands to stop sourcing tuna caught using the combination of FADs and purse seine nets. Pams (2) and Greenseas (3) have both committed to change with Pams introducing more sustainable alternatives this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As New Zealand’s largest supplier of canned tuna Sealord should be ashamed to be associated with a fishing method that lays waste to so much ocean life. While Sealord defends indiscriminate FAD fishing their competitor Pams has become a market leader in tuna sustainability in New Zealand by switching to FAD-free and pole and line caught tuna,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Banning FADs in purse seine fisheries is an important step towards protecting the Pacific from destructive tuna fishing which is threatening tuna stocks and the region's food security and economic prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 11/6/12: The release of Pure Advantage’s report on the clean opportunities presented by the global clean energy race is being described by Greenpeace New Zealand as a clarion call for action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand’s government and businesses need to recognise that the global green growth train is about to leave the station without us,” says Nathan Argent, Greenpeace New Zealand’s Chief Policy Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Green business is big business - global green growth is potentially worth as much as NZ$6 trillion a year - and the Government’s lack of vision is going to mean that we’re in serious danger of missing out on one of the biggest opportunities this country has ever had,” says Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Bill English was recently quoted on &lt;em&gt;Stuff.co.nz&lt;/em&gt; as saying that: “If you want a job where it doesn’t exist now, then you have to do something we’re not doing now”, when referring to his Government’s strategy to encourage the exploitation of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been projected that by 2030, 65 per cent of global energy jobs will be in renewables (1). We want New Zealand to get a share of these clean energy jobs, but the Government is doing nothing to secure them,” says Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the sake of the climate and our long term economic prosperity, the Government must abandon its fossil fuel agenda and work with businesses to build a cleaner, smarter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pure Advantage report shows that progressive Governments the world over are taking action to move away from the dirty fossil fuels of yesteryear. It’s now our Government’s turn to act, before the opportunity passes us by,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;

	The eight Greenpeace activists arrested during their occupation of a Shell-chartered drillship were today remanded for a further two weeks, till May 3rd, pending ongoing negotiations over the charges they will face.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is hopeful of a reasonable and fair outcome on this date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven of the activists climbed the drilling tower of the Noble Discoverer on February 24, while it was moored in Port Taranaki. All were arrested after a 77-hour occupation of the tower. An eighth activist was arrested on the first day of the operation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell is spearheading a push to exploit the Arctic for oil, as climate change causes the average summer sea ice to shrink rapidly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who climbed the tower are charged with burglary – not because they were alleged to have stolen anything or done anything dishonest, but because it is alleged they were there and committed another offence while at the Port - namely going onto the Noble Discoverer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our activists never shy away from the consequences of their actions. But those who took part in this important campaign are not burglars and this charge is not considered appropriate to reflect their actions” says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Steve Abel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actions of this team has brought the campaign to protect the Arctic to global attention, and inspired hundreds of thousands to join that battle to protect the Arctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actress Lucy Lawless, who is one of those charged, says: “Seven of us climbed that drill ship but now 376,000 people have added their names to the call for Shell to stay out of the Arctic. That figure is growing every day. All of us are proud to have played a part in warning the world about Shell’s plans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The fight to save the Arctic is destined to become one of the defining environmental struggles of our age,” Abel says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell wants to become the first oil major to begin production in the Arctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the eight activists were travelling to Taranaki, Greenpeace activists in Russia took action by bringing the Save the Arctic message to a meeting of investors and oil industry representatives in Moscow. Twenty-two activists were arrested following that action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Let’s embrace clean energy; we’re going to have to anyway, so why not do it before they cause a major oil spill in the Arctic, and consign our grandchildren to an uncertain and dangerous world?” Lawless asks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	- A sea change in government strategy
- Safety concerns
- The risks of deep-sea oil
- Where is deep-sea oil exploration taking place in New Zealand?
- International oil companies in the dock



&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated: May 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of the authorities to cope with the effects of the recent oil spill from the Rena cargo ship, despite the best efforts of Maritime New Zealand, has brought into sharp focus the environmental risks involved in the Government’s decision to open up vast swathes of the country’s coastal waters for deep-sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rena accident highlights the devastation that can be caused by what in global terms was actually a relatively small oil spill at 350 tonnes and shows the difficulties of mounting a clean-up operation even when the source of the leaking oil is so close to shore. It raises the spectre of the environmental catastrophe that could occur if an accident on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico were to occur in New Zealand’s remote territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential dangers of deep-sea drilling, and the exploration of oil below water depths of 200 metres, have been understood for years. But until recently such dangers were only ever academic as the extraction of deep-sea oil was regarded as prohibitively expensive. In the last few years, however, a combination of declining global oil reserves from traditional sources (1) and rising oil prices worldwide has driven companies to seek out ever riskier sources of oil in order to maintain their revenue streams. And sadly, successive New Zealand governments of different political stripes have shown themselves only too willing to assist.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 5/4/12: This month a collection of original prints made from a little blue penguin and a diving petrel killed by the Rena disaster will go on a three-centre tour, going on public display in venues in Christchurch, Dunedin, and Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel says: "This memorial to the birds that were killed by the &lt;em&gt;Rena’s&lt;/em&gt; oil is also a stark reminder of the dangers of opening up New Zealand waters to deep sea oil drilling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two birds were found dead and covered in oil on Matakana Island by Greenpeace volunteers when they were helping the local iwi, Nga Hapu o te Moutere o Matakana, clean oil off their beaches following the &lt;em&gt;Rena&lt;/em&gt; spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An art collective made up of creatives from Publicis Mojo and Greenpeace volunteers came up with the concept of making ‘oil prints’ with the birds, using some of the actual oil from the &lt;em&gt;Rena&lt;/em&gt;, and donated their time to create the prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten of the prints were made on canvas; another 20 were used as A3 posters. All were exhibited in Auckland prior to Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impacts of the &lt;em&gt;Rena&lt;/em&gt; accident shocked New Zealanders, but the 350 tonne spill could be dwarfed by a deep sea oil disaster, the prospect of which is becoming more real by the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploratory deep sea drilling – the same activity that the Deepwater Horizon was engaged in when it exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 - will be getting underway off the South Island later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deepwater Horizon accident leaked 627,000 tonnes of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, while engineers spent months struggling to fix a problem 1.5 kilometres below the sea’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the easy-to-reach supplies of oil run out, the oil industry is pushing into new frontiers, including deeper and deeper waters, and the Arctic, in search of new reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies that have brought this search to New Zealand have been involved in numerous devastating oil spills worldwide, including the Deepwater Horizon spill, and a recent deep sea spill off the coast of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies could be drilling in water up to three kilometres deep (1), twice as deep as the water the Deepwater Horizon was operating in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once exploratory drilling begins later this year, New Zealand will be under threat from a Deepwater Horizon-type disaster off our coast. The authorities didn’t have a hope of containing the &lt;em&gt;Rena’s&lt;/em&gt; oil. Imagine waiting helplessly for more than a 1000 times more oil to wash up on Dunedin’s St. Clair Beach, Christchurch’s New Brighton Beach, Raglan, Stewart Island, or on the Wairarapa coast,” Abel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allowing the oil industry to set up whole new frontiers in exploration runs directly counter to the clean energy expansion the world needs if we are to have any chance of avoiding runaway climate change,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date over 138,000 people have signed Greenpeace’s petition to stop any deep sea oil drilling - and the expansion of coal mining - in New Zealand, in favour of a clean energy future. The petition will be closing soon (www.greenpeace.org.nz/oil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDITOR’S NOTES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 15/11/11: Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company that is intending to drill for oil in up to 3100 metres of water off the East Cape, is the part-owner of an oil field northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where a serious oil leak has developed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far 90 tonnes of crude oil has leaked into the sea, and an oil sheen can be seen above the 1200 metre deep Frade field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not known how the leak, which is beneath a network of deep sea wells, will be plugged. Divers can only descend to 200 metres to fix wellhead leaks, making deep sea accidents extremely difficult to control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The field’s operator, Chevron, initially claimed that the spill was a natural event. The company has since admitted that it most likely caused the spill, by over pressurising the oil reserve. This is thought to have fractured rock above the reserve, letting oil escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are currently no deep sea wells in New Zealand waters. But a number of companies, including Petrobras, have plans to drill here for deep sea oil. Anadarko – a part owner of the Deepwater Horizon, the rig which exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico last year, spilling 650,000 tonnes of oil – is planning to start drilling off the North Island’s west coast, and Canterbury, before the end of next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This accident off Brazil yet again shows that deep sea oil is far too risky,” says Simon Boxer, Greenpeace New Zealand Senior Climate Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Deep sea oil drilling employs unproven technologies, to exploit the last drops of oil, in the world’s most pristine areas. New Zealand is far too precious to endanger in this way. And the climate is too important to life on this planet to destroy by going after the last of the fossil fuels,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 15th October 2011. A team of volunteers organised by Greenpeace New Zealand will today begin work cleaning toxic fuel oil off beaches in the Bay of Plenty.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace scientist, who monitored the impact of the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last year, has also been brought to the Bay of Plenty to provide expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers will be working under direction of Greenpeace staff, who have completed training with Maritime NZ on how to safely deal with oil spills, and who will conduct the clean up in line with international best practice on the handling and disposal of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure a coordinated clean up effort, Greenpeace will liaise each day with Maritime New Zealand, who will direct the Greenpeace team on where to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ is providing the volunteers with all the equipment needed to do the job safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We feel that as part of our response to the Rena disaster, it is important that we do something practical to help on the ground,” says Steve Abel Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our appreciation goes to all the people who volunteered their time so willingly,” Abel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be working with local and international scientists to gather and disseminate information on the likely immediate and long term effects of the Rena spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	On the eve of the latest round of climate talks in Durban, Greenpeace declares that it is time for our governments to listen to the people, and not the polluters.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace volunteers raise a wind turbine at dawn in Durban, South Africa, to send governments a message of hope for the latest round of UN climate change talks opening in Durban on Monday. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;As communities around the  world are facing real climate impacts on a daily basis, governments must  now stop listening to the carbon-intensive polluting &lt;a title="Who's holding us back" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/climate/politicians-need-to-listen-to-the-people-not-/blog/37985/"&gt;&lt;span class="zoom"&gt;corporations who are holding us back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from decisive action.
&lt;p class="FreeFormA"&gt;Instead they should be listening to the calls of  people who want an end to our dependence on fossil fuels, and immediate  action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="FreeFormA"&gt;This round of the UN climate talks, the 17th  Conference of the Parties, must be the point where our governments  respond to the international climate crisis by adopting a clear roadmap  towards a science-based, global agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="FreeFormA"&gt;The deal must ensure that all countries take action  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions dramatically, and that financial and  technical support is delivered to the poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="FreeFormA"&gt;South Africa, as the continent's highest CO2  emitter and the host country must show climate leadership to help reach a  meaningful outcome over the next two weeks in Durban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Africa is already bearing the brunt of the climate gone awry, but  that does not seem to be enough to spur some countries to action, like  the US. The US needs to step up now and help the world beat climate  chaos. The talks in Durban need to be a new dawn for global climate  change negations. One in which the interests of people everywhere are  put before those of the polluters” said Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace  International Executive Director from Durban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that the US is a major emitter and must be part of a  global agreement is increasingly looking like an excuse for inaction on  the part of other governments, such as the EU, and emerging economies  including India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US still fails to engage in a global fight to stabilise the  climate, its time for governments like the EU, and emerging economies  including India and China to move on without the US. This is the last  chance for the US. The entire global effort to reach agreement on tackling climate  change must not be allowed to be held hostage by the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Non-negotiables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on governments in Durban to listen to the people, not the polluting corporations, and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure a peak in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the Kyoto Protocol continues and provide a mandate for a comprehensive legally binding deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver the necessary finance to tackle climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a framework for protecting forests in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure global cooperation on technology and energy finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure international transparency in assessing and monitoring country commitments and actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="title"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 21st November 2011: Greenpeace today confirmed that it stands 100 per cent behind the investigation which proved that samples of toilet paper manufactured by Cottonsoft contain Indonesian rainforest fibre.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid said: “We are 100 per cent behind our statements about Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), and its New Zealand subsidiary Cottonsoft, fuelling rainforest destruction. This is based on both robust forensic testing, and years of experience on the ground in Indonesia, documenting deforestation and tracking the companies involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued: “This attack comes as no surprise – Cottonsoft’s parent company Asia Pulp and Paper has been wheeling its huge PR machine around the globe in the past few weeks, attacking Greenpeace, as more and more companies decide they don’t want to buy into APP’s brand of rainforest destruction.” (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than spending their cash on PR consultants, APP and Cottonsoft should put their energy into cleaning up their act. Every other toilet paper manufacturer in New Zealand manages to operate successfully without trashing rainforests – why can’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is Cottonsoft that is endangering the jobs of its workers, by using rainforest fibres to manufacture its toilet paper. There are plenty of sustainable sources of pulp that could be used instead,” McDiarmid says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPS Global, which carried out the tests for Greenpeace, is a heavyweight independent testing lab used by &lt;a href="http://www.ipstesting.com/AboutIPS/Clients/tabid/69/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;major companies&lt;/a&gt; in the international paper industry like Kimberly-Clark, SCA, International Paper and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble. The lab’s clients also include the U.S. Department of Defense, Customs, and the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDITOR’S NOTES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)   APP have already been dropped as a supplier by major companies around the world, including Kraft, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Carrefour, because of its reliance on rainforest destruction to make pulp and paper products.&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra’s use of palm kernel expeller (PKE) could hide a large source of unaccounted climate emissions, making a significant contribution to the carbon footprint of its milk products - palm products are typically grown on cleared rainforest or peatlands in South East Asia. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 6px;" src="/new-zealand/PageFiles/367174/pke-report.jpg" alt=""&gt;Tropical forest destruction is responsible for around a fifth of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Ending deforestation is not only a central part of a global strategy to tackle climate change, but it is also crucial for the preservation of the region’s biodiversity. The endangered orang-utan and the Sumatran tiger are just two of the species under threat of extinction due to the loss of their natural forest habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports of PKE into New Zealand skyrocketed to a record high of over 1.4 million tonnes in the 2010/11 dairy season, almost all of which was used on Fonterra’s dairy farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These imports are responsible for the release of up to 8.91 million tonnes of climate wrecking emissions. This is the equivalent to 12 per cent of New Zealand’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.4 million tonnes of PKE that were imported in the 2010/1011 season came at a cost (prior to it being shipped to New Zealand) of over $265 million. This money goes straight into the hands of the palm industry.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has today released further evidence showing how tissue products made by Cottonsoft, a subsidiary of Indonesian paper giant Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), are contaminated with rainforest fibres.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The new research, conducted last month by German laboratory the  Institute of Paper Science and Technology, found rainforest fibre in a  second batch of samples from the same Cottonsoft products tested earlier  this year by IPS - a company which names among its clients US  Government departments, the FBI and a host of major companies in the  pulp and paper sector.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This additional research further confirms the accuracy of those earlier tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace released this new evidence after a PR company working for  Asia Pulp and Paper subsidiary Cottonsoft falsely claimed on Monday that IPS - the testing company that undertook initial tests on the  Cottonsoft-branded toilet paper - had disowned their results (1).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In fact, a letter from IPS to Greenpeace in October states that:  “Our lead fiber analyst… is a recognised expert in the field. The  findings of his work are clear for the materials that Greenpeace sent us  for analysis: the principle component in the samples was Acacia, a  plantation hardwood, while mixed tropical hardwoods were also seen in  some samples”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace has always made clear that the laboratory provided only  analysis of the toilet papers for rainforest and other fibres. The  additional evidence confirming the source of the rainforest fibre as  being from Indonesia was provided by Greenpeace research on the ground,  and a search of company records (2).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is today writing to the PR company who made this claim and to  APP/Cottonsoft asking for an immediate retraction of the false  statements they issued to media.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; APP/Cottonsoft also claimed that they have test results proving that  their toilet paper was sustainable, but have so far refused to confirm  which products were tested and have failed to make the full test results  available.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace NZ Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Once again APP/Cottonsoft has been caught red-handed. No amount of PR  sleight of hand changes the facts - which are that APP/Cottonsoft’s  supply chain is contaminated with rainforest fibre.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “This is presumably why Cottonsoft were the only company that refused to  cooperate with Greenpeace’s original survey of the sustainability of  Kiwi toilet roll brands.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The Kiwi roots of Cottonsoft are sadly a distant memory. The company is  now a subsidiary of APP, the world’s most notorious rainforest  destroyer, a company that even now refuses to stop pulping Indonesia’s  rainforests for its throwaway paper products. APP’s procurement  practices are the reason that multinational companies like Nestle,  Mattel, Kraft, Unilever, Adidas and others have stopped doing business  with them. We call on Kiwi companies to do the same until the company  reforms it practices.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “It’s time for APP/Cottonsoft to clean up their act and give people want  they want – toilet roll that doesn’t trash the rainforests,” McDiarmid  said.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; APP, one of the two biggest paper pulp companies in Indonesia, is  rapidly expanding around the world. It bought Cottonsoft in 2007, as  part of a strategy of aggressively expanding in Australasia.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; APP admits to using fibre that comes from Indonesia’s rainforests in its  pulp mills, as confirmed by its most recent CSR report. It terms this  fibre “mixed wood residues”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; APP has also announced that it will need to remain dependent on the  clearance of Indonesia’s rainforests until the end of 2015. APP’s  business development strategy is based on the ongoing expansion of its  suppliers into rainforest areas (3).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Interviews with Bunny McDiarmid can be arranged through Jay Harkness, Greenpeace NZ Media and Communications, on &lt;a href="tel:021%20495%20216" target="_blank"&gt;021 495 216&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (1) In a 21 November press release Cottonsoft’s Corporate Affairs  Director Steve Nicholson stated: “Greenpeace based its misguided and  misleading campaign against Cottonsoft on a single premise: it had  commissioned tests which proved that APP products contained fibre from  what Greenpeace called “trashed Indonesian rainforest”. The company  Greenpeace employed to carry out the tests, Integrated Paper Services,  has since stated categorically in a letter that there is no scientific  basis for this claim.’ &lt;a href="http://www.cottonsoft.co.nz/pdf/CottonsoftMediaRelease21Nov-2011.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cottonsoft.co.nz/pdf/CottonsoftMediaRelease21Nov-2011.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In further press statements APP/Cottonsoft said:&lt;br&gt; "We commissioned the independent testing by Covey Consulting following  Greenpeace's erroneous attack on our business. We took this further step  following confirmation from Integrated Paper Services, the company  which did the initial testing for Greenpeace, that the exaggerated  claims about 'trashed Indonesian rainforest' were not supported by the  data.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.voxy.co.nz/business/cottonsoft-willing-meet-greenpeace/5/108455" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.voxy.co.nz/business/cottonsoft-willing-meet-greenpeace/5/108455&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (2) Forensic tests by IPS conclusively found rainforest fibre (mixed  tropical hardwood/ MTH) in Cottonsoft toilet rolls. Further tests by a  German Laboratory both verified this finding.&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace did not claim that the IPS tests in-and-of themselves  identify or 'prove' country of origin. But it’s clear that the MTH fibre  test results do, in this case, indicate or 'show' the country of origin  as Indonesia, because Indonesia is the only country where MTH is  harvested at a commercial scale for pulp. The presence of acacia in the  test results provides further supporting evidence that Indonesia is the  origin of the pulp fibre; the vast majority of acacia pulpwood  plantations are being harvested from Indonesia at this time, with APP  being one of the largest producers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Furthermore Greenpeace have extensive evidence linking APP to rainforest  destruction. It starts with APP’s own documents. Some of these  documents are public, like its latest corporate social responsibility  report in which APP admits that it uses rainforest fibre, though it  prefers to refer to this in PR-speak as "mixed wood residues". And then  we have our own research. By carrying out overflights of APP concession  areas we have repeatedly documented, using GPS images, large-scale  rainforest clearance by APP’s suppliers. Our mappers have pinpointed  deforestation in APP concessions, our on-the-ground investigations have  tracked the timber from these areas to APP mills, and our  chain-of-custody research links the products from these mills to  companies like Cottonsoft.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (3) Greenbury (2011) ‘Truly sustainable business model eliminates “either/or” choices’, Eco-Business. com, 14 April 2011 &lt;a href="http://www.eco-business.com/blog/%0Atruly-sustainable-business-model-eliminates-%E2%80%9Ceitheror%E2%80%9D-choices-by-aidagreenbury/" target="_blank"&gt;www.eco-business.com/blog/&lt;br&gt; truly-sustainable-business-model-eliminates-%E2%80%9Ceitheror%E2%80%9D-choices-by-aidagreenbury/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The initial IPS test results, and a letter from IPS confirming  their test results are available from the Greenpeace press office.

	Guam, 27 March 2012 – A report showing there is an increasing global demand for responsibly sourced tuna was released by Greenpeace yesterday at the start of an international meeting in Guam to decide on the future of Pacific tuna.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) listen to consumer and industry demand for sustainable tuna and end all fishing in the Pacific Commons (1). Greenpeace is also calling for a ban on wasteful Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in purse seine fisheries and for the bigeye tuna catch to be cut by half.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace report ‘Changing Tuna’ outlines progress taken by tuna companies around the globe to save Pacific tuna in recent years (2). It highlights New Zealand retailer Foodstuffs which has changed most of its Pams range to sustainably caught tuna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we want ample fish and fishing industries for the future, we need drastic change today,” said Sari Tolvanen, Greenpeace International oceans campaigner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The report shows that change is taking place across the global tuna marketplace, thanks to consumers and visionary business leaders. It is clearer than ever that the WCPFC must strengthen its existing conservation measures and manage Pacific tuna populations for the benefit of everyone, not just the industrial fishing industry lobbyists.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is the world’s largest tuna fishery, where roughly 60 per cent of the world’s tuna supplies come from. Valuable bigeye tuna is now overfished and yellowfin skipjack and albacore tunas are all in decline. Destructive fishing methods, such as purse seine fishing on FADs are largely to blame along with the WCPFC’s failure to follow its own scientists’ advice in reducing tuna catches.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We know that illegal fishing is rampant in the Pacific, causing island communities to lose food and jobs to foreign fishing powers, the same ones who are trying to unravel conservation measures here in Guam. This can and must be the year when this Commission puts the ability of the world to eat and fish tuna for generations to come ahead of corporate profits,” added Tolvanen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans and for a more sustainable fishing industry, both necessary steps to restoring our oceans to health. Around the world, Greenpeace is working with retailers and tuna brands across Europe, Australia and the Americas to increase the market share of sustainably-sourced tuna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	 The water in our world's oceans is always moving - pulled by tides, blown by waves, and slowly circulating around the globe by the force of the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt (aka thermohaline circulation). The Conveyor is powered by differences is water temperature and salinity, and one of its most well know parts, the Gulf Stream, is what gives Europe it's relatively mild climate.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm salty water from the Gulf Stream is cooled when it reaches the North Atlantic. It becomes denser and sinks to deeper layers of the ocean, 'pumping' cold water south in the deep ocean, past Africa into the South Atlantic. Salt rejected as sea ice forms also increases the density of these waters and contributes to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dense, cooled water becomes part of what is called the Ocean Conveyor, and the water eventually returns to the surface in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. As warm water returns to the Atlantic, the current moves pole-wards as the Atlantic Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, warming northwestern Europe substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from keeping Europe warm, and playing an important role in the global climate, the Conveyor provides an up welling of bottom ocean nutrients, and increases the oceanic absorption of carbon dioxide. The Gulf Stream is what moderates European climate, the whole system is called The Great Conveyor Belt, the Great Ocean Conveyor, or whatever other popular name you want to give to the thermohaline circulation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What could go badly wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, recent studies warn that we may already have evidence of a slower Conveyor circulation over the Scotland-Greenland deep ocean ridge. And while the Conveyor appears to have operated fairly reliably over the past several thousand years, an examination of ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica shows that this has not always been the case. In the more distant past, changes to the Conveyor circulation are associated with abrupt climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, dilution of the ocean's salinity - from melting Arctic ice (such as the Greenland ice sheet) and/or increased precipitation - could switch off, slow down or divert the Conveyor. This dramatic cooling would mean a massive disruption to European agriculture and climate, and impact other sea currents and temperatures around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

	Take one random floating object, attach a radio beacon so you can find it again, drop it in the ocean and return later with a giant net and scoop up everything in sight. This is how much of the world's tuna is caught - using fish aggregating devices (FADs) with purse seine nets and it's a recipe for disaster. New Zealand’s five big brands of canned tuna have committed to phase this destructive fishing method out of their supply chains.

	Auckland 19 July 2012: Te Whānau ā Apanui and Greenpeace have appealed the High Court’s decision declining to overturn a permit given to Brazilian oil company Petrobras to drill for oil in the deep water off the East Cape. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and te Whānau ā Apanui have lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal on the basis that the High Court made several errors of law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Minerals Programme for Petroleum - which Gerry Brownlee, the Minister for Energy and the Minister who gave Petrobras the permit, was legally required to follow - required consideration to be given to any international obligations that were relevant in managing the petroleum resource. Greenpeace argued that this must include environmental considerations, which Mr Brownlee told the High Court that he did not consider before granting the permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the High Court Justice Gendall held that the Minister did not have to consider any environmental obligations, including any international environmental obligations, when he granted the permit. Greenpeace and te Whānau ā Apanui are appealing this finding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are also appealing the finding that the Crown did not breach its Treaty of Waitangi obligations, including duties of active protection and proper consultation with iwi before awarding the permit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Crown Minerals told us that the potential effects of the oil exploration would be ‘generally minor, short-term and restricted to small areas’”, says te Whānau ā Apanui’s Rikirangi Gage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But the expert affidavits that we put before the Court show that seismic testing has effects on marine mammals and fish, and that the exploratory phase is the most dangerous part of the oil production process. The Deepwater Horizon, which exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, spilling 627,000 tonnes of oil, was also an exploratory well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Petrobras’ permit actually requires it to drill an exploratory well. We could potentially have a Deepwater Horizon on our hands, off the East Cape and Bay of Plenty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Given that an area twice the size of the North Island was closed to fishing after the Deepwater Horizon spill, that would be a disaster for the whole country,” Gage says.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace does not believe that deep sea oil exploration can ever be safe. If we are to prevent catastrophic, runaway climate change, the oil industry must not be allowed to open up its last, extreme frontiers, either in the Arctic, or in the deep waters off New Zealand," Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is clear to just about everyone that the future, whether you’re talking about economic prosperity, keeping our clean green reputation, or the survival of our planet, is in clean energy,” Atkinson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 1 August 2012 – New Government guidelines for seismic oil exploration will fail to protect New Zealand marine life, says Greenpeace.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Government's Code of Conduct for minimising impacts of seismic testing were announced late this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seismic testing is known to cause harm to whales and dolphins (1). The acoustic noise from seismic testing can injure or kill marine life when in close proximity. The sound can be detected up to 3000 kilometres away. Seismic testing also has an impact on marine migration, feeding, communication and reproduction (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Political Advisor Nathan Argent said it was likely seismic testing would continue in ecologically sensitive areas regardless of the Government’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace has deep reservations about the effectiveness of the Code of Conduct as it’s a voluntary scheme. In other countries such as the UK and Australia, they are mandatory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Code there are no requirements to conduct environmental impact assessments or to inform local communities before exploration work starts. Despite the known effects that seismic testing can have on whale, dolphin and fish populations, there are no provisions to establish liability or to levy fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has proposed that the Code be incorporated under the proposed EEZ Bill, which has been widely criticised for failing to meet New Zealand's international legal obligations to ‘protect and preserve’ the marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Code will do nothing to protect our marine life and ocean ecosystems from reckless deep water oil exploration,” said Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our relationship with the sea is vital to New Zealanders. Around one million Kiwis are recreational fishers, and the vast majority of us spend some time in or on the ocean. All deep sea oil and gas exploration in the EEZ should be prohibited,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 13 November 2012 – Greenpeace says it will continue to challenge Shell’s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic ahead of a court case next week where Shell is demanding $700,000 in reparations from  eight activists who delayed its drillship leaving Port Taranaki to head to the Arctic  in February this year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eight activists are due to appear in the New Plymouth District Court next Thursday, November 22, for sentencing. Seven of the activists climbed the drilling tower of the Noble Discoverer on February 24, while it was moored in Port Taranaki. All were arrested after a 77-hour occupation of the tower. An eighth activist was arrested on the first day of the operation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid says Shell’s reparation claim is totally unjustified, given that the activists acted out of a moral duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Along with our activists we drew the world’s attention to Shell’s plans for drilling in the fragile Arctic. Since then it’s been exposed that Shell’s emergency response plan was hopelessly inadequate and failed when tested before the company gave up on drilling in the Artic for this northern summer,” she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our eight activists are not alone. Since February this year more than two and a half  million people have signed a petition calling on Shell to abandon its plans for the Arctic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The reparation figure the company is pursuing is a drop in the bucket by comparison to the nearly US$5 billion Shell has spent on its Arctic drilling programme so far. This indicates that Shell has resorted to corporate bullying in its desperation to be the first oil supermajor to start production in the Arctic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In September Shell lost its bid in an Amsterdam court to stop Greenpeace peacefully protesting against its drilling programme in the Arctic.&lt;br&gt;The President of the Amsterdam court, Han Jongeneel, said the protests Greenpeace Netherlands has already taken in the Netherlands at Shell’s headquarters and petrol stations were both proportionate and appropriate in light of Greenpeace’s earlier efforts to end Shell’s Arctic oil drilling through other means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A company like Shell, that is taking actions or plans to take actions that are controversial in society and which many people will object to, can and should expect that actions will be taken to try to change its mind. Such actions – in order to be effective – will have to be capable of disadvantaging Shell,” Jongeneel wrote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday 29 January 2013: The Rainbow Warrior is heading to the Auckland Islands which is home to critically endangered sea lions, yellow eyed penguins and Gibson’s albatross. The islands and surrounding marine reserve are listed as a World Heritage Area, alongside the Egyptian Pyramids and the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the departure from Lyttleton yesterday, the Rainbow Warrior is currently sailing through the oil drilling zone off Canterbury that Anadarko plans to drill in by the end of 2013. Here the Rainbow Warrior crew saw juvenile sperm whales feeding on the surface surrounded by royal albatross, giant petrels and a number of other sea birds who call this area home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government wants to open up vast areas for deep sea oil drilling south of Dunedin, Stewart Island, and into the wild seas towards the Auckland Islands. Many of our incredible and rare native birds, sea lions and whales live here and would be at risk,” said Bunny McDiarmid, Executive Director of Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dates and location: The Rainbow Warrior is expected to arrive at the Auckland Islands on Thursday 31 January and depart Sunday 3 February after documenting some of our most marvellous wildlife. On Monday 4 February we’ll be documenting the wildlife of Snares Island, south of Stewart Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December the Government also gave out new deep sea oil and gas exploration permits (1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Out from Dunedin to Shell, OMV and Mitsui in the Great South Basin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Out from Wellington/Wairarapa/Marlborough to Anadarko which also puts Kaikoura in the the spill zone&lt;/p&gt;

	Climate change is a reality. Today, our world is hotter than it has been in two thousand years. By the end of the century, if current trends continue, the global temperature will likely climb higher than at any time in the past two million years.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the end of the 20th century may not necessarily be the warmest time in Earth's history, what is unique is that the warmth is global and cannot be explained by the natural mechanisms that explain previous warm periods. There is a broad scientific consensus that humanity is in large part responsible for this change, and that choices we make today will decide the climate of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we are changing the climate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a century, people have relied on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas for their energy needs. Burning these fossil fuels releases the global warming gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Other, even more potent, greenhouse gasses are also playing a role, as is massive deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Joint statement by 11 national science academies to world leaders (&lt;a href="http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf"&gt;full text&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are still uncertainties, particularly related to the timing, extent and regional variations of climate change, there is mainstream scientific agreement on the key facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain gasses, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere create a "greenhouse effect", trapping heat and keeping the Earth warm enough to sustain life as we know it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, etc). releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Although not the most potent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is the most significant in terms of human effects because of the large quantities emitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are now the highest in 150,000 years.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1990's was most likely the warmest decade in history, and 1998 the warmest year.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There is also widespread agreement that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A certain amount of additional warming - about 1.3 º Celsius (2.3 º Fahrenheit)   compared to pre-industrial levels - is probably inevitable because of emissions so far. Limiting warming to under 2 ° Celsius (3.6 °F) is considered vital to preventing the worst effects of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If our greenhouse gas emissions are not brought under control, the speed of climate change over the next hundred years will be faster than anything known since before the dawn of civilization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is a very real possibility that climate feedback mechanisms will result in a sudden and irreversible climate shift. No one knows how much global warming it would take to trigger such a "doomsday scenario".&lt;/li&gt;

	Auckland, 3 March 2012 — A federal judge in Alaska has rejected the bulk of a lawsuit brought by Shell Oil Company against Greenpeace USA which would have been one of the broadest and most restrictive in US legal history, according to the environmental group.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Following a four-day occupation last week by Greenpeace New Zealand activists — including actor Lucy Lawless — of the Shell-contracted Noble Discoverer drillship in New Zealand, Shell has launched a pre-emptive legal strike that intends to silence opposition against the company’s controversial plans to drill in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the coast of Alaska.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell’s original proposed Temporary Restraining Order, filed on February 24 with an Alaskan court, could have been applied to any of Greenpeace USA’s 500,000 email subscribers who chose to take action with the organization at gas stations, regional offices or other venues around the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shell is trying to intimidate and stifle any voices who want to speak out against its reckless plans to drill in the ice-choked waters off Alaska,” said Ben Ayliffe, Greenpeace International Senior Polar Campaigner, “But Greenpeace and a multitude of supporters will not be silenced and will fight this one right through the courts.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The judge rejected Shell’s request as too broad but instead issued a limited order, which applies to the oil company’s two drilling vessels, the Kulluk platform and the Noble Discoverer drilling ship. In her decision, Judge Gleason wrote: “Shell has failed to demonstrate that a temporary restraining order of such breadth is necessary or warranted at this time.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In support of its complaint, Shell referred to an activity almost 10,000 kilometres from Alaska in which activists from Greenpeace New Zealand joined the actor Lucy Lawless to stop a Shell drillship from leaving for the Arctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Nearly 200,000 people around the world have joined with Greenpeace to protect the High North and support our actions, urging Shell to cancel plans to drill in the Arctic this summer,” said Ayliffe. “This is about more than Greenpeace. Shell is also trying to gag the hundreds of thousands of global citizens who agree with us. This is an infringement on our right to free speech and to peaceful public protest.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: this proposed order is separate to an additional lawsuit, which attempts to preempt a legal review of Shell’s oil spill response plan and involves other environmental groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Temporary Restraining Order will last for 14 days unless further extended by the court. A hearing on Shell’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (a more permanent measure) is scheduled for 14 March 2012 at 9:00 a.m. in Alaska.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Pacific Ocean, 15 November 2012 – Greenpeace International has uncovered a large-scale illegal transfer of fish at sea between one ship from Cambodia, one from the Philippines and two from Indonesia in the Pacific Commons.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;None of the boats are on the official record of vessels authorised to operate in the area and they are therefore not allowed to fish or transfer fish at sea according to the rules of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International collected photo and video evidence showing MV Heng Xing 1, a reefer sailing under the Cambodian flag, transshipping fish catches with two Indonesian tuna purse seine vessels (KM Starcki 10 and KM Starcki 11) and one Filipino reefer (Sal 19).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indonesian and Philippine vessels are bound by WCPFC rules and their involvement in the transshipment is therefore illegal. (1) Cambodia is not a member of the WCPFC and the reefer is therefore considered unregulated. In addition, an oil slick, stretching a mile long was also observed during the transshipment. Greenpeace will share this evidence with the relevant governments and the WCPFC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The failure to close the area in which these activities were observed allows illegal and unregulated activities to continue. The massive multinational illegal transshipment between these four vessels clearly demonstrates the urgent need to close the Pacific Commons to all fishing and ensure regional enforcement is ramped up,” said Farah Obaidullah, Greenpeace International oceans campaigner on board of MY Esperanza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace activists boarded the MV Heng Xing 1 and examined the fish hold, which was full of mostly frozen skipjack tuna and some yellowfin, likely destined for canned tuna markets. Yellowfin tuna was recently assessed under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria for threatened species and are now classified as near threatened (2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Transshipment between vessels is illegal in this area of the Pacific under WCPFC rules because it makes fish catch data and the management of key tuna resources very difficult. Often, this is a way for fishing operations to avoid paying fees to island nations, communities that need fish and income to continue surviving,” added Obaidullah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pacific is the source of 70 per cent of the world’s tuna, providing coastal communities not only with food but also economic prosperity. For years, Greenpeace has been working with Pacific governments to address overfishing and prevent foreign fishing nations from plundering their fishing grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves covering 40% of the world’s oceans, including in four high seas areas known as the Pacific Commons (3), and these be declared off limits to fishing. The environmental group is also seeking a ban on the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) in purse seine fisheries and a 50 per cent reduction in the catch of bigeye tuna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These measures are important to keep valuable fish stocks at a sustainable level and will be reviewed at the upcoming meeting of the Western and WCPFC in Manila from 2-7 December. Around the world, Greenpeace is working with retailers and tuna brands across Europe, the Americas and the Pacific to increase the market share of sustainably-sourced tuna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

            Bleached coral, Great Barrier Reef. Coral bleaching is the result of high water temperatures which kill the coral. Climate change will dramatically increase damage like this.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See also the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Templates/Planet3/Pages/DetailPage.aspx?id=19036&amp;amp;eplanguage=en-GB"&gt;Deforestation&lt;/a&gt; page in the Science section)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each species evolves to thrive in its own particular ecological niche - to live in a particular "home" with specific living conditions (including temperatures ranges and other plant and animal species). Some species are more adaptable, or "opportunistic", than others. For example,rats and dogs can survive under many different conditions, but koala scan only live where there is eucalyptus. Human caused climate change will alter temperatures, precipitation and sea level - wiping out some habitats and shifting others faster than many species can migrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless we drastically reduce our greenhouse gase missions, we can expect several factors to combine that will make the coming die out astonishingly severe. The climate is changing faster than at almost any time in our planet's history. Also, many ecosystems are already stressed by human activities - destructive logging, excessive grazing, over fishing, toxic pollution and the like.And, human development and habitat destruction impedes many species from migrating - superhighways effectively block land animals, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the world's endangered species -- some 25 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds -- may become extinct over the next few decades as warmer conditions alter the forests, wetlands, and range lands they depend on, and human development blocks them from migrating &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;elsewhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent major study indicates that if global temperatures increase 1.8-2° Celsius (3.2-3.6°F), which is considered amid-range estimate, a million species would be threatened with extinction over the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6970/full/427107a_fs.html"&gt; next fifty years&lt;/a&gt;.This can only be avoided by rapid emissions reductions in the next few decades. There is still time to save many species, but it is fast running out.  Of course, if temperatures go even higher, more species will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of species and habitats at risk: &lt;a href="#coral"&gt;Coral Reefs&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="#polar_bears"&gt;Polar Bears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#plants"&gt;Plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="coral"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coral bleaching is a condition that can seriously damage and kill entire coral reefs. Corals contain microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that provide the coral with food and give them their vibrant colours. Rising ocean temperatures cause corals to become stressed, and they expel the zooxanthellae and turn white or "bleach". If zooxanthellae do not return to the coral's tissue, the coral will die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As little as a 1° Celsius (1.8°F) increase in temperature above the summer maximum can cause corals to bleach. Tropical sea temperatures have increased by1° Celsius over the past 100 years and are predicted to continue rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this problem is Australia's world famous Great Barrier Reef, which lies off the state of Queensland. At around2,000 kilometres (1,243 miles) long it is the world's largest reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2002 the reef experienced its worst ever case of coral bleaching,with over 60 percent of the reef being affected. Unless projected levels of climate change are slowed, much of the reef will be dead in decades. Deprived of their living homes, hundreds of species relying on the reef will also die out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="coral"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;Polar bear in Greenland&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A polar bear walks along the ice edge in the Robeson Channel.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic sea ice could disappear within 70 years, and wild polar bears with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- START DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar bears are the world's largest land predator. They can go for long periods, even months, without eating, but need to build up fat to live through lean times. The polar bear does this mostly by eating seals they catch on the ice. Without the ice they can't get to their prey. In fact, without sea ice, much of the Arctic ecosystem would change or collapse. Polar bears also use floating sea ice platforms for travel, and pregnant polar bears build snow dens for the winter, which they give birth in. In the last two decades, Arctic ice cover has retreated five percent and the ice that is left has lost at least 30percent of its thickness; and an average of two weeks have been lost from the bear's hunting season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="coral"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like animals and insects, plant species require specific climates. You don't find yellow birch trees  growing next to Saguaro Cactus, for example. Changes in precipitation and temperature will mean that some species can no longer survive where they are now growing. Also, like animals plants, are vulnerable to competition. As warming occurs, species that have adapted to living in cooler climates can be pushed out of existence by newcomers better suited to the new temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most plants can't migrate very quickly,compared to animals and insects. They are restricted by how far their seed or pollen can travel, and the climate will change too fast for many of them if current trends continue. Human barriers (such as farm sand urban areas) will also impede plant migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many animal sand insects need specific plants, or types of plants, as part of their habitat.  So the loss of plant species will have a ripple effect -leading to more animal and plant extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 26 February 2012: The occupation of Shell Arctic drillship Noble Discover has continued for a third day. Five Greenpeace activists and actor Lucy Lawless remain in place on top of the drillship, after spending a chilly second night on top of its 53 metre drilling tower.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2012/_MG_7378.jpg" alt="Actor Lucy Lawless and Greenpeace New Zealand activists on the second day of their protest to stop a Shell-contracted drillship from departing Port Taranaki for the remote Arctic, where its exploratory oil drilling programme threatens to devastate the Alaska's coastline. Six Greenpeace New Zealand activists, along with Lawless, famous for her roles in Xena: Warrior Princess and Spartacus, boarded the vessel and scaled its 53-metre drilling derrick more than 24 hours ago. Yesterday they hung a banner from its highest point, which read &amp;quot;Stop Shell&amp;quot;. This morning they deployed a new banner which reads &amp;quot;#SaveTheArctic&amp;quot;. The activists are equipped with survival gear, and enough supplies to last for several days." width="600" height="425"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morale onboard has been &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/news/blog/is-anyone-out-there/blog/39234/"&gt;boosted by the thousands of support messages&lt;/a&gt; that have been flooding in over the course of the day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday activists hung a giant #SaveTheArctic hashtag banner on the drill tower and the hashtag has been trending on and off around the world ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists, who are equipped with iphones and tablets, which they are keeping charged with a foldable solar panel, have been inundated with twitter messages, facebook comments and emails from supporters around the world. All of this is being aggregated in a ‘live feed’ on the Greenpeace home page: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s been so inspiring to get all of these online messages and to know that standing alongside the six of us on this ship, there are hundreds of thousands of other people  around the world who feel passionate about the Arctic and are prepared to take action to put a stop to Shell’s crazy Arctic drilling plans” said activist Viv Hadlow.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In direct response to the drillship occupation over &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org/savethearctic"&gt;122,000 people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have emailed Shell over the past 48 hours, asking the company to drop its Arctic oil drilling plans.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 20 November, 2012 – Thursday’s sentencing of Lucy Lawless and seven other activists, arrested following the occupation of the Shell-chartered drillship the Noble Discoverer in New Plymouth in February, has been adjourned again.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is the second time the sentencing of the eight activists has been postponed due to Shell not providing the required information, in time, for its reparation claim of around $700,000 from the activists. The original sentencing date was September 14. A new date has yet to be confirmed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven of the activists climbed the drilling tower of the Noble Discoverer on February 24, while it was moored in Port Taranaki. All were arrested after a 77-hour occupation of the tower. An eighth activist was arrested on the first day of the operation.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid says Shell’s reparation claim is totally unjustified, given that the activists acted out of a moral duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Along with the activists we drew the world’s attention to Shell’s plans for this hostile, yet fragile environment, in which an oil spill would be impossible to clean up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Since then it’s been exposed that Shell’s emergency response plan was hopelessly inadequate and failed when tested before the company gave up on drilling in the Arctic for this northern summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The activists are not alone. Since they delayed the Noble Discoverer, back in February, more than two and a half million people have signed a petition calling on Shell to abandon its plans for the Arctic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Greenpeace has been advised that the charges laid against the organisation for action last April to stop the Amazon Warrior seismic blasting for oil at sea are to be dropped.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will not pursue the hefty charges laid against Greenpeace under the controversial Anadarko Amendment, which means the organisation now avoids up to $200,000 in fines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director, Russel Norman, and climate activist, Sara Howell, will still face charges for their part in the action. They have always admitted their conduct but say they should not face conviction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will plead guilty and seek a discharge without conviction on the basis that their conduct was justified and necessary to bring about required change to government policy. If the Court agrees, the outcome would be the same as an acquittal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The news follows the Government’s historic announcement earlier this month of an end to all new offshore oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last April, Norman and Howell swam in front of the Amazon Warrior - the largest oil exploration ship in the world - forcing it to stop its search for oil for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pair and Greenpeace were subsequently charged for the first time in New Zealand history under a controversial amendment to the Crown Minerals Act made by Simon Bridges in 2013 when he was Minister of Energy, known as the Anadarko Amendment, which outlaws peaceful protest against oil ships at sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have never denied the facts, that we defied the ban on protest at sea. We see the best course of action now is to plead guilty while making a plea in mitigation in Court on the grounds that our actions were reasonable and honourable given the threat of climate change. We remain hopeful that the Court will agree, given the importance of this issue," says Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Taking this route will also save supporter money and court time, and allow us to continue tackling climate change."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High profile witnesses including the former President of Kiribati, Anote Tong; the world’s leading climate scientist, James Hansen; and UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author, James Renwick of Victoria University; will be providing supporting statements in the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says the fact that charges against Greenpeace have been dropped is a "breakthrough" that comes after a year-long legal process, and follows a seven-year campaign to end oil and gas exploration in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Amazon Warrior protest was part of an almost decade-long campaign to bring an end to fossil fuel exploration in our seas given the very urgent and real threat of climate change - and we’ve just had a significant victory with that campaign," Norman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Over seven years, tens of thousands of people have marched, protested and lobbied their local leaders against oil exploration. This culminated in Jacinda Ardern’s announcement to end new offshore oil and gas permits, which puts four million square kilometres of the Earth’s surface out of bounds for new oil and gas exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Although the tide has turned irreversibly against big oil in New Zealand waters, the fight is not yet over. We still want to see an end to onshore extraction and the revoking of existing permits."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fellow activist, Howell, says it’s been encouraging to see how effective peaceful protest can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I’m proud and humbled that I had the opportunity to contribute to an incredible, people-powered movement that’s resulted in an end to new offshore oil and gas exploration permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"While I will take responsibility for what I did in the Court, I believe it was necessary because all of the life on this planet - in its oceans, mountains, rivers, forests, and cities - is marvelous and brilliant. It is delicately balanced and too special to destroy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, Norman, and Howell were due to begin trial in the Napier District Court on Monday. They will now appear by video link from Auckland District Court to lodge their pleas, and the case will be adjourned for sentencing on a date yet to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

	A Horizon opinion poll commissioned by Greenpeace reveals that 52 percent of Kiwis think are too many cows for our waterways to cope with.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;David Parker has gone on record saying New Zealand had "too many cows" and that farmers may have to reduce herd numbers under proposed new waterway pollution rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It’s great to hear the Government reflecting the concerns of so many New Zealanders that there are too many cows for our waterways to cope with." says Greenpeace sustainable agriculture campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Horizon Research report also showed that only 16% of people asked felt that cow numbers could continue to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a breakdown of political parties 66 percent of New Zealand First voters, 56 percent of Labour voters and 90 percent of Green party supporters felt there were too many cows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"National leader Simons Bridges was on the radio this morning trying to kick up a fuss about the Minister’s comments. He’s clearly out of touch with his base," says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among National voters polled 40 percent thought there were too many cows. Only 20 percent of National voters thought the herd should continue to expand. 29 percent of National voters think that there are about the right number of cows, and 11% were unsure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our polling found that twice as many National voters think there are too many cows than those who feel numbers can continue to grow."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace though believes the Government needs to go further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"On its own, regulatory action against nutrient pollution doesn’t go far enough," says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We urgently need fewer cows but the industry is still converting more land into dairy farms. The Government needs to directly stop new conversions and halt intensification of existing dairy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey also found support for a moratorium on new dairy conversions. Overall, 44% agreed that the Government should put in place a moratorium on dairy conversion, while only 15% disagreed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A majority of voters for Labour, New Zealand First and the Greens supported the moratorium. Meanwhile, more National voters supported the moratorium than disagreed with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next few months the Government will review the National Policy Statement for Freshwater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace is calling on the Government to turn new dairy conversions and intensification of existing livestock farming into prohibited activities under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would mean land not currently in dairy would no longer be able to made into new dairy farms and that farmers wanting to add cows to their herds would no longer be able to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It’s time to reduce the herd, diversify away from intensive dairying and switch to more regenerative ways of farming."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Evidence released today reveals that Auckland based company Cottonsoft is sourcing its toilet paper from rainforests in Indonesia, home of the critically-endangered Sumatran tiger.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The evidence is the result of an eight-month investigation by Greenpeace, the Green Party and WWF-New Zealand into exactly where the toilet paper sold by New Zealand retailers originates from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cottonsoft refused to disclose where they were sourcing their toilet paper from so samples were sent to a US laboratory for forensic testing. This confirmed the presence of mixed tropical hardwoods (timber that comes from rainforests) in a range of Cottonsoft products (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cottonsoft are a subsidiary of the notorious conglomerate Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which has been dropped as a supplier by major companies around the world, including Kraft, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Carrefour because of their reliance on rainforest destruction to make pulp and paper products (2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, the Green Party and WWF-New Zealand are calling on retailers to stop stocking Cottonsoft and other APP Products until the company commits to ending rainforest destruction. They are also asking the public to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Cotton-Soft/"&gt;use their consumer power&lt;/a&gt; to force Cottonsoft products off the shelves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help consumers find 'rainforest friendly toilet paper' a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Cotton-Soft/"&gt;shoppers guide&lt;/a&gt; was released today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia is now the biggest supplier of imported toilet paper pulp to New Zealand, supplying one in four toilets rolls sold in New Zealand (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The destruction of Indonesia's rainforests is one of the main threats to the survival of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, only 400 of which are estimated to remain in the wild. It is also an increasing source of conflict between tigers and humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today Greenpeace New Zealand released shocking footage of a Sumatran tiger that was caught in a trap and later died in an APP logging concession in Riau, Indonesia.

Trashing rainforests to make toilet paper is simply obscene", said Green Party forestry spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WWF-New Zealand's Executive Director Chris Howe said, "Many New Zealanders will want to make sure their shopping choices are not harming forests and wildlife in Indonesia. We encourage people to help ensure the forest homes of endangered tigers and orangutans remain in tact by using the consumer guide to make the right choice at the checkout."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia has one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of rainforest are being cleared every year. Rainforest destruction is also acknowledged as a major driver of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 17/8/11: As Shell Oil was announcing its involvement in plans to drill in the deep water of the Great South Basin, off the bottom of the South Island, the 1300-barrel spill from a rig operated by Shell in the North Sea was being labelled as ‘substantial’ by the UK Government.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Shell kept the leaks secret for two days after they began, and is refusing to say how much oil is still escaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Shell rig that is leaking in the North Sea is in only about 95 metres of water, and yet they still can’t quickly stop a leak,” says Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Steven Joyce, speaking in Parliament earlier this year, put the depths in the Great South  Basin at 1700 metres deep. There would be no hope of quickly fixing a problem at those depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exxon Mobil, a company infamous for its poor environmental record, gave up its right to explore in the Great  South Basin on the basis that the risks were too high. And yet Shell, along with its partners, are happy to expose the Southern Coast and Stewart  Island to a Gulf of Mexico-style oil disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP’s exploratory rig, the Deepwater Horizon, was operating in 1500 metres of water when it exploded and sank last year, spilling millions of barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell’s name is closely linked to a series of disastrous oil spills in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not the sort of industry we want in our waters. The Government has to give up on its obsession with expanding the fossil fuels industry, and instead invest in clean technologies that will address the climate crisis, and provide the sort of stable economic future that will give us real prosperity’” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seismic survey is expected to begin in the Great South  Basin in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has released drone video footage revealing a major dairy incursion into wilderness country in the Mackenzie.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The shots show the beginnings of a pipeline to take water out of the Waitaki catchment to irrigate a massive dairy operation for up to 15,000 cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2018/202A3768.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Corporate dairy is gearing up to destroy the Mackenzie country, a unique and precious wilderness, home to critically endangered native species," says Gen Toop, Greenpeace’s sustainable agriculture campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The irrigation pipeline is being built by Dunedin accountant and developer Murray Valentine and is set to run across Crown land currently owned by the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Mackenzie is not cow country. It’s dry, it’s soils are leaky- which means dairy pollution runs straight through the stones and into the waterways, and it’s incredibly ecologically sensitive" says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proposed site for the corporate dairying operation just south of Lake Pūkaki is a unique desert-like dryland on glacial outwash plains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simons Pass is home to 18 threatened plants and four threatened bird species, including the critically endangered Black Stilt. There are 100 left in existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"To make enough grass grow for intensive dairy in this dry environment Mr Valentine will have to heavily irrigate with water from our lakes and rivers as well as apply tonnes of chemical fertilisers - much of which will end up in the waterways."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"New Zealand already has too many cows for our rivers, our land and our climate to cope with. We cannot allow the dairy industry to convert more land into dairy farms, especially not in the Mackenzie" says Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Government must step in, stop all new dairy conversions and start reducing the herd."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Environment Minister David Parker announced this week that incoming tougher nutrient pollution regulations may mean fewer cows on some farms in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Greenpeace says this will not be enough and is calling on the Government to stop all new dairy conversions and intensification of existing livestock farming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environmental organisation launched a ‘&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/23869/petition/1" target="_blank"&gt;Save the Mackenzie’ petition&lt;/a&gt; on Friday calling on the Government to make new dairy conversions and intensification of existing livestock farms prohibited activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has gained more than 10,000 signatures in 48 hours, one of Greenpeace’s fastest growing petitions in recent years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The momentum of this petition should embolden the government to stand up to corporate dairying and stop it from destroying more of New Zealand," adds Toop. "It’s time to diversify away from intensive dairying and support farmers to switch to more regenerative ways of farming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s estimated 23,000 olympic swimming pools worth of water will be drawn out of the catchment each year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plans are to install 26 pivot irrigators, some more than a kilometre long turning the golden tussocks into green artificial circles of ryegrass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same pattern that can be seen from the air in the south of Mackenzie country. (see UAV shots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservative estimates are that the development will leach 76,615 kg/Nitrogen/year and 1,938 kg/Phosphorus/year into the Waitaki catchment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The soils on which this conversion is planned are characterised as well drained or excessively well drained (CRC062387)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Auckland August 5 2011: Greenpeace NZ is celebrating the news today that Texan corporate Anadarko has postponed plans to drill test wells off the Taranaki and Canterbury coasts this summer. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The news comes hard on the heels of the Government’s failure to find any takers for its offshore oil block offers off Northland’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story in the &lt;em&gt;Energy Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, published today, quotes Anadarko as saying that it has not been possible to find a rig early enough in the season to carry out its planned drilling programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However one unnamed industry commentator is also quoted in the story as crediting Anadarko’s announcement to the flotilla-based protest that Greenpeace, te Whanau a Apanui, Ngati Porou, and various other organisations mounted earlier this year to disrupt Petrobras’s seismic survey off the East Cape (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is another major nail in the coffin for the Government’s programme of the deep sea oil drilling in New Zealand,” says Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our best opportunity for prosperity is going to come from making the transition to a smart clean economy, and of course clean energy is a vital part of that,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland Tuesday August 23rd, 2011: Greenpeace today accused Cottonsoft of completely failing to address forensic evidence that their toilet rolls contain Indonesian rainforest fibre.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner Nathan Argent said, “Cottonsoft can’t greenwash away the bald fact that forensic tests found parts of an Indonesian rainforest in their own brand toilet roll.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the international PEFC standard to which Cottonsoft claim to be certified, only plantation timber can be used in products, yet independent tests commissioned by Greenpeace clearly show the presence of rainforest timber (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argent continued, “Either Cottonsoft are deliberately misleading New Zealanders by claiming all their products are certified as sustainable or Cottonsoft has accidentally admitted that PEFC-certified products contain rainforest timber, which places them at the heart of an international scandal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace sent a letter this morning to the Chief Executive of Cottonsoft challenging a media statement that the company issued late last night claiming that they were being ‘unfairly targeted’ by Greenpeace, WWF and the Green Party in a report released by the groups on Monday (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was copied to all of New Zealand’s major food retailers. &lt;br&gt;The Warehouse has already suspended orders of Cottonsoft toilet rolls pending an investigation (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argent continued, “We urge Foodstuffs and Progressive Enterprises to follow The Warehouse’s example and suspend stocking Cottonsoft products until the company can 100% prove they have stopped destroying rainforests to make toilet roll.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cottonsoft are a subsidiary of the notorious conglomerate Asia Pulp and Paper (APP). APP have already been dropped as a supplier by major companies around the world, including Kraft, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Carrefour because of their reliance on rainforest destruction to make pulp and paper products (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world. The Indonesian Government estimates that more than one million hectares of rainforest are being cleared every year. Rainforest destruction is also acknowledged as a major driver of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests is also one of the main threats to the survival of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, only 400 of which are estimated to remain in the wild. It is also an increasing source of conflict between tigers and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday Greenpeace New Zealand released shocking footage of a Sumatran tiger that was caught in a trap and later died in an APP logging concession in Riau, Indonesia.

	Auckland, July 31st 2011: Iwi, community and environmental organisations united at a hui in Auckland this weekend, with the goal of stopping the Government’s efforts to dramatically ramp up the exploitation of fossil fuels in Aotearoa New Zealand. This includes oil drilling, underground hydraulic fracturing (fracking), and the mining of coal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The hui at Nga Whare Waatea Marae in Mangere was a huge success, according to various spokespeople, was attended by iwi members, groups, organisations and concerned individuals from around the country including: Te Whānau-ā-Apanui, Ngati Porou, Nga Puhi, Poutama, Parihaka, Greenpeace New Zealand, Forest and Bird, ECO, Hauraki Watchdog, Climate Camp Aotearoa, Coal Action Network, Climate Justice Taranaki and the West Coast Environment Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong alliances were formed which will set those who attended on a new path to combat climate change, and avoid the harm caused by oil drilling and new coal and gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers included Rikirangi Gage of te Whānau-ā-Apanui, and former Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hui concluded with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are united and determined to stop the destructive expansion of fossil fuel extraction in the lands and waters of Aotearoa New Zealand.  We support the transition to appropriate renewable fuel and energy systems for the good of all people, species, the economy and the climate.  We will work together across the country, to these ends. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has spent tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money subsidising seismic surveys, in order to attract the deep sea oil industry to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-owned enterprise Solid Energy is planning to mine billions of tonnes of lignite coal in Southland – the dirtiest coal there is in terms of greenhouse emissions.  Underground fracturing (fracking) for oil and gas is already occurring in Taranaki, and is being planned for areas throughout the country. Fracking has devastating effects on water, land and air quality and human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government is pushing the expansion of the fossil fuels sector contrary to the need for a global transition towards clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those represented here at the hui intend to change the directions of those plans by working together with our communities, and taking peaceful action to ensure that Aotearoa New Zealand’s energy future is a clean one, and not one tied to destructive and unnecessary fossil fuels,” says Steve Abel, Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s actions come despite global greenhouse gas emissions being extremely close to triggering a state of runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	The world's #1 sportswear brand, Nike, has accepted our Detox challenge: today it has officially committed to eliminating all hazardous chemicals across its entire supply chain, and the entire life-cycle of its products by 2020. This is a major win for our campaign to protect the planet’s precious water, and create a toxic-free future.

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike's announcement comes just five weeks into our&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/detox/"&gt; Detox campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which began when we launched the "&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt;" report, revealing commercial links between major clothing brands - including Nike, Puma and Adidas - and suppliers responsible for releasing hazardous chemicals into Chinese rivers. We challenged these brands to champion a toxic-free future by committing to work with their suppliers and remove these toxic chemicals from their clothes and China's rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nike sets a new pace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/puma-leaps-ahead-of-nike-and-adidas-in-detox-/blog/35881/"&gt;Puma was first&lt;/a&gt; to break away from the pack, opening up an impressive lead by announcing that it would go toxic-free. Puma's commitment to remove all hazardous chemicals from its entire product-portfolio must have left their competition wondering how they were going to raise their game. Now, Nike and Puma are the front-runners, and Adidas is far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike also agreed (&lt;a href="http://www.nikebiz.com/media/pr/2011/08/17_zero_discharge.html" target="_blank"&gt;their full statement&lt;/a&gt;) to address the issue of the public's "right to know" by ensuring full transparency about the chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The more the public knows about the toxic chemicals spilling out of these factories, the more the pressure to stop them polluting will increase. The importance of this cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sportswear giant has also promised to use its influence, knowledge and experience to bring about widespread elimination of hazardous chemicals from the clothing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists tonight projected messages including, “Water Pollution Is Not Fair Play” and "The World Needs More Champions. Is Adidas All In?" to the almost 100,000 fans attending the Spanish Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (sponsored by Adidas) at the Nou Camp Stadium, in Barcelona, Spain.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can Adidas top that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By committing to clean up its act, Nike is showing hints of greatness - but we will be closely monitoring the company’s implementation plan, due to be published by 18 October. And just because Nike’s taking the lead shouldn’t mean Adidas or other clothing companies can simply throw in the towel. The game is still on and they should be hot on Nike's heels to become champions of a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas have a lot of ground to make up. If they want to be considered contenders, they need to get in the game by committing to zero discharge and really take the lead by developing a new culture of transparency throughout the clothing industry and helping others stop the release of hazardous chemicals currently used during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's like Green My Apple again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind the Detox campaign comes from a year-long investigation into the textile industry's water pollution problem in China, where vital research helped us to connect the dots and link hazardous chemicals and their impacts in waterways like the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas to textile factories and international clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these brands, one group stood out as the most likely to become champions of a toxic-free future: Leading sports clothing companies like Nike and Adidas. Not only do they like to market themselves as leaders and innovators, they also have the size and influence to work with their suppliers to eliminate the use and release of these hazardous chemicals from the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="366" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkou6xAb6Rw" width="590"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enormous task of changing the toxic practices of an entire industry can be extremely daunting, so we went in search of a potential leader with the will to change itself and the influence to change others. Much as we did during &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/"&gt;our Green My Apple campaign&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was vital to engage with innovative and proactive industry leaders - the sort of companies who are willing to put their slogans into action and &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that "impossible is nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much encouraging by Greenpeace and Apple aficionados, in March 2009 Apple become the first laptop maker to eliminate toxic poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). For now we have only commitments from Nike and Puma, though they are on the right track and deserve recognition for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Detox campaign kicked off when our mysterious XM3N &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/xm3n-mannequins-reveal-their-mission-to-chall/blog/35757/"&gt;mannequins finally revealed their mission&lt;/a&gt; to clean up China's rivers. Their message was spread by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8OB68YeMmc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;our video&lt;/a&gt; – watched and shared by 100s of 1000s of Greenpeace supporters and sports lovers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people really started to get involved and the game was well and truly on. Actions from &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-argentina/es/noticias/Greenpeace-desafia-a-Adidas-y-Nike-a-liderar-un-futuro-libre-de-toxicos---/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.nl/Nieuws_2011/Reusachtig-actie-T-shirt-aan-hoofdkantoor-Nike/" target="_blank"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/photosvideos/photos/Activistas-de-Greenpeace-cuelgan-los-trapos-sucios-de-Nike-y-Adidas-en-la-plaza-de-Callao-de-Madrid/"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; – including a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/hundreds-strip-to-challenge-nike-and-adidas-t/blog/35853/"&gt;world wide striptease&lt;/a&gt; – made sure the world’s biggest brands couldn’t ignore the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further pressure to perform was piled on by world’s media as the story ran far and wide, from New York to &lt;a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqgj/jryw/2011-07-13/content_3188213.html" target="_blank"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/942969-setor-textil-contamina-rios-chineses-acusa-greenpeace.shtm" target="_blank"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/environmentalists-raise-awareness-with-coordinated-striptease-2326010.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. In Hong Kong&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our exhibit helped bring the message to the street where passers-by took a moment to put their demands for Detox in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50,000 people &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org//new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Tell-Nike-and-Adidas-to-Detox/"&gt;signed our petition&lt;/a&gt; to the CEOs of Nike and Adidas, many thousands of people have tweeted and shared the campaign on social networks and blogs, submitted logo designs, or contributed campaign ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Adidas have a tough act to follow, and everybody's watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share this story today, to remind people that pressure works, that together we can win, and that there's hope for a clean, toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;

	New York/Amsterdam, August 25, 2011. – Celebrities from around the world are taking their commitment to save the planet to the next level to raise money for Greenpeace’s new flagship Rainbow Warrior. From backstage passes to private lunches you’ll see celebrities giving it up to the highest bidder in an attempt to raise money to pay for the world’s leading environmental organisation’s new environmentally friendly ship.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Along with charitybuzz, the charity auction house, Greenpeace announced auctions of celebrity items to be held through September. The auction opens today and will run through to September 21st, at &lt;a href="http://www.charitybuzz.com/greenpeace"&gt;http://www.charitybuzz.com/greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is Greenpeace’s first purpose-built vessel, and will play a key role in the fight to stop environmental destruction and promote sustainable solutions, allowing the organisation to continue bearing witness and taking action to prevent environmental crimes around the world. The ship will be ready to sail in Autumn 2011, to mark Greenpeace’s 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrities are helping the cause by offering up their dinner reservations and giving VIP access to concert backdoors, all to raise money in the charitybuzz online auction. Highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 VIP tickets to a Paul Mc Cartney show on his US tour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An afternoon with Patricia Arquette&lt;/li&gt;

	Auckland 30/8/11: The Government’s Energy Strategy released this morning is an act of gross economic incompetence, committed by an cabinet that is refusing to give up its obsession with fossil fuels, says Greenpeace NZ.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The strategy turns its back on New Zealand’s clean technologies sector in favour of subsidising international oil, and thereby denying ourselves the chance of entering into the global cleantech revolution,” says Simon Boxer, Greenpeace NZ’s Senior Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy does not mention the six billion tonnes of lignite in Southland that the SOE Solid Energy has bought the rights to. Almost more carbon is contained within those reserves than is emitted by the United States every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government is being extremely dishonest by not including lignite in this document, despite the prime minister’s public support for Solid Energy’s plans,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentions in the strategy of mostly hydro-based renewable energy supplies, which come off the back of heavy investment in this area in the last half of the last century, hide the fact that the strategy has fossil fuels investment at its core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PricewaterhouseCoopers produced a report in 2009 that made it clear that New   Zealand stood to gain $20 billion from its cleantech sector. But this opportunity is about to be lost forever, thanks to this Government’s myopia,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China is going to spend $12.7 billion on geothermal projects alone over the next five years. New Zealand is a world leader in geothermal technologies, and yet the Government is doing nothing to secure overseas contracts in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of capitalising on New Zealander’s famous ability to come up with creative engineering solutions to complex problems, the Government is spending millions on trying to attract the deep water oil industry here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Energy Strategy will saddle New Zealanders with a massive carbon liability, and the risk of a deep water oil disaster – for the sake of foreign oil companies’ profit margins. Deep water oil exploration is a threat to our clean green reputation, because of the impossibility of quickly cleaning up a deep water spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any oil delivered by an offshore rig off the coast of New Zealand will only go onto the international market – it won’t do anything to make oil cheaper here. That, combined with the Transport Minister’s road focussed strategy, is only going to worsen the effects of our economy’s addiction to fossil fuels,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of the fossil fuels industry’s final frontiers will dramatically increase our climate emissions, at the same time as the Arctic heads towards a historic minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this rate, John Key's legacy will be one of having missed the economic opportunities of the cleantech revolution sweeping the world, whilst parking New Zealand in a fossil fuels-economic backwater," Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	There's a skeleton in H&amp;M's closet. The fast-fashion retailer sells clothes made with chemicals which cause hazardous water pollution around the world, and the only way to stop this water pollution is to come clean and stop using such chemicals for good. As one of the largest clothing groups in the world, an H&amp;M committed to a toxic-free future would set the trend for the rest of the fashion industry to follow.

&lt;p&gt;Nine weeks into our Detox campaign, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/detox-campaign-hat-trick-adidas-joins-nike-an/blog/36569/"&gt;the world's three biggest sportwear brands&lt;/a&gt; have already committed to eliminate discharges of all hazardous chemicals across their entire supply chains, and their entire product life-cycle by 2020. They are now preparing individual Detox Action Plans in consultation with our campaigners for delivery between September 20 (Puma) and mid October (Nike and Adidas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;H&amp;amp;M needs to come clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does H&amp;amp;M keep its prices so low? And where are its factories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's current commitment to transparency just doesn't wash. Nike and Adidas, for example, have already published a list of their suppliers online, and have published extensive details about their hazardous chemicals management program. In contrast, H&amp;amp;M only publishes general information about its "Restricted Substances List" and does not reveal where its suppliers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it have to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For H&amp;amp;M to be &lt;em&gt;fashion forward&lt;/em&gt;, it needs to match the efforts of Nike, Adidas and Puma by committing to eliminate all uses and discharges of hazardous chemicals throughout its entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But simply matching is not enough - to really stand out, H&amp;amp;M needs to be honest with both its customers and the people living near its factories about where its suppliers are located and what hazardous chemicals these factories are releasing into our precious waterways during the manufacture of its clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exposing H&amp;amp;M's Dirty Laundry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M is the largest clothing company featured in our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/"&gt;Dirty Laundry 2&lt;/a&gt; reports, which detail the science behind the Detox campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research confirms that H&amp;amp;M has links to factories discharging a range of hazardous chemicals into China's rivers, and that clothing --   including kids clothing -- sold by H&amp;amp;M, contain &lt;em&gt;nonylphenol ethoxylates&lt;/em&gt; (NPEs) that break down into the toxic &lt;em&gt;nonylphenol&lt;/em&gt; (NP). These chemicals are a cause for serious concern, as they are known hormone disruptors and can be hazardous even at very low levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonylphenol&lt;/em&gt; and other chemicals found in our sampling are man-made substances that can persist in the environment and can have potentially devastating effects as they accumulate up the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative chemicals and manufacturing methods exist, so why is H&amp;amp;M still dragging its heels and refusing to Detox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No 'safe' amount of hazardous chemicals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/detox-campaign-hat-trick-adidas-joins-nike-an/blog/36569/"&gt;Adidas's commitment&lt;/a&gt; on August 30 to zero discharge of hazardous chemicals, means that now all three of the world's leading sportswear companies have recognized that there is no such thing as a 'safe limit' when it comes to these substances. This is a significant shift for the companies, and a milestone for our campaign to stop industry poisoning our water with hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/toxics/2011/HM-so-last-season.jpg" alt="HM Detox - Toxic is so last season"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reputation on the line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M's reputation as an industry leader in sustainability is on the line, as the company faces questions over its commitment to people and the environment in China and elsewhere. With the fashion season already upon us, H&amp;amp;M are running out of time to show the world what it's capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We're eyeing H&amp;amp;M&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time for H&amp;amp;M to publicly claim its place as a leading brand in the effort to Detox our water, and to commit to its customers, its workers and the communities whose resources it shares that H&amp;amp;M is ready to champion a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Detox campaigners are meeting with H&amp;amp;M decision makers this week to find out if the company is now ready to take responsibility for its actions, and lead the fashion industry towards a toxic-free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M, which made US$17 billion in sales last year, likes to tout how close it is to its suppliers (cutting out the middle-men cuts costs), so what's to stop H&amp;amp;M from using this influence to catalyze change across the fashion sector, and leading a Detox and transparency revolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take action&lt;/h2&gt;

	Greenpeace and te Whānau-ā-Apanui today filed a judicial review challenging the Government’s decision to issue Brazilian oil giant Petrobras a permit for deep sea oil exploration off the East Cape.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is the first time an oil permit has been challenged in the New Zealand courts on both environmental and Treaty of Waitangi grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and te Whānau-ā-Apanui will argue the Government acted unlawfully by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failing to properly consider      the environmental impact of activities associated with the permit as      required under international law (1); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failing to properly consider      the potential effects on marine wildlife; the licences relate to areas close      to environmentally-sensitive sites which support species such as whales      and dolphins that are legally protected. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failing to properly undertake      their requirements to have proper regard to the principles of the Treaty      of Waitangi,  including consultation      with te Whānau-ā-Apanui; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failing to give consideration      to the iwi’s fishing rights and customary title claims to the area. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Statement of Claim filed today asks that the Petrobras permit be quashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government is ignoring the lessons from the Deepwater Horizon blow out in the Gulf of Mexico. The BP spill was a game-changer, highlighting the very real risks of dangerous deep sea drilling for both important wildlife and the economy. Rather than approving ever riskier oil drilling projects the Government should be developing a comprehensive plan to end New Zealand’s dependence on oil,” says Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Real economic security for New Zealand will come from developing our own green fuels and ramping up the efficiency of our public and private transport, not scraping the bottom of the oil barrel in fragile habitats and treacherous seas like those off the East Cape," adds Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rikirangi Gage, of te Whānau-ā-Apanui, says: "We have a sacred responsibility to protect and preserve our natural environment and the Government has a sacred duty under the Treaty of Waitangi to work alongside us to achieve this. The Government is continuing to fail both these obligations and is putting both the marine environment and our communities at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than pander to the interests of foreign oil companies, the Government must face up to the fact that the burning of  fossil fuels is one of the major contributors to global climate change and that we must all join together as a nation to protect our children’s future,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judicial review is a legally-binding evaluation of the way the Government reached a decision, to see if the decision-making process was correctly followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the judicial review is successful, the Petrobras permit would be quashed. The Government would have to reconsider Petrobras’ application and address any issues as directed by the final judicial review decision. This could include requirements to consider the environmental impacts, or to consult with te Whānau-ā-Apanui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EDITOR’S NOTES:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Specifically; failure to take into account New Zealand’s obligations under customary international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS), and the Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region 1986 (South Pacific Convention).&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland May 18 2011: Increased subsidies for fossil fuels are fiscally irresponsible and pose a major threat to our clean, green reputation and our economy, Greenpeace says.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to drop its focus on developing our fossil fuel resources and to place&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clean-tech and clean energy at the forefront of this year’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to the Government’s own leaked Energy Strategy, high oil prices are threatening New Zealand’s economic recovery, and energy security. Yet, the Government spends nearly a billion dollars a year in subsidies through the Emissions Trading Scheme, and plans to put another ten billion into new motorways, which will only increase our dependence on oil,” says Bunny McDiarmid, Executive Director of Greenpeace NZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing Auckland's CBD rail loop, and proactive investments in clean-tech industries are just two examples of how this budget could shape a low carbon and energy secure future for New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Around the world, investment in renewables continues to outstrip that of fossil fuels&lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/a/greenpeace.org/?ui=2&amp;amp;view=bsp&amp;amp;ver=ohhl4rw8mbn4#130006aee50dce77__ftn1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a global cleantech race on, yet the Government is failing to grasp the opportunity to put New Zealand’s clean energy businesses in pole position,” says McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Government is serious about economic growth, it must end these perverse fossil fuel subsidies and start investing in cleaner, smarter technologies,” she says.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Energy efficiency programmes like those run by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) are crucial to our future and pay for themselves many times over. Promoting efficient energy use and energy savings should be a core issue for any New Zealand Government as they are the most effective way to slash emissions and improve energy security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our pristine environment is an asset held in trust for future generations, not a trust fund to be pilfered for short-term returns," McDiarmid says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

If the estimated US$39 billion of investment in large hydro is included, then total investment in renewables exceeded that in fossil-fuel generation for the second successive year (&lt;a style="color: #33464c;" href="http://uncsd.iisd.org/news/unep-releases-global-trends-in-green-energy-2009-reports/" target="_blank"&gt;http://uncsd.iisd.org/news/unep-releases-global-trends-in-green-energy-2009-reports/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 10 August, 2011 – Greenpeace has run a full page advertisement, (1) in this week’s issue of a women's magazine calling on Sealord to change its canned tuna to more sustainable sources.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Based on the seafood species posters once common in fish and chip shops, the ad features images of 18 marine species, from sharks to tropical fish, but labels them all as tuna. The tagline reads; Sealord tuna. What’s the catch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sealord gets its tuna from companies using fishing methods that are catching and killing far more than just tuna,” says Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Industrial fishers are combining fish aggregation devices (FADs) and purse seine nets resulting in shameful waste of ocean life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna instinctively gather around FADs, but, Thomas says, these “oceanic minefields also attract the whole cast of Finding Nemo, including threatened sharks, juvenile tuna and even turtles”. Known collectively as bycatch, all of these creatures are then scooped up by the purse seine nets. They are often thrown back into the sea injured, dead or dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to statistics circulated by Sealord, bycatch of other species is five to 10 times higher when purse seiners use FADs. This wasteful method also has serious impact on tuna stocks, as juvenile and undersized tunas make up 15-20 per cent of the catch,” says Thomas. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months ago Greenpeace launched a campaign calling on New Zealand’s main brands of canned tuna to stop selling tuna caught this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then more than 13,000 emails have been sent to Sealord by concerned customers, urging the company to change its tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to consumer concerns Foodstuffs announced on World Oceans Day in June that it will be changing most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free by the end of the year. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas John West has just committed to phase out its use of FAD-caught tuna, joining the rest of the UK's main canned tuna brands which have shifted, or committed to shift, to more sustainably caught tuna. (4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An updated ranking of the main tuna brands in Australia, released by Greenpeace today, shows two companies have committed to stop selling FAD-caught tuna and two others have improved on sustainability since last year. (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of New Zealand’s canned tuna comes from the Pacific which, until recently, had the world's last healthy tuna fisheries. These are now under threat as industrial fishing fleets, which have exhausted tuna stocks in other oceans, are concentrating their efforts in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning globally to create a more sustainable and equitable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans - necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 22/8/11: New Zealand’s leading environmental groups today welcomed news that The Warehouse has suspended orders of Cottonsoft toilet rolls, pending an investigation into evidence that the product is sourced from Indonesian rainforests.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In an email to a concerned customer The Warehouse stated, “The Warehouse will suspend all orders relating to this product range pending further information from all related parties” (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action follows this morning’s release of an investigation by Greenpeace, the Green Party and WWF-New Zealand. It revealed that forensic testing on cotton toilet rolls found the presence of mixed tropical hardwoods (timber that comes from rainforests) in a range of Cottonsoft products (2). Indonesia is the only large scale producer of pulp that uses mixed tropical hardwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Nathan Argent said, “This is great news that The Warehouse has taken the step of suspending all orders of Cottonsoft products. It is clear that they take their role as a responsible company seriously. We look forward to Foodstuffs and Progressive Enterprises following suit and suspending all trade in toilet paper that has come from trashed rainforests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Howe, WWF-New Zealand’s Executive Director said “We welcome the news that The Warehouse has suspended all orders of Cottonsoft products pending further investigation. By putting the fate of endangered wildlife and their forest homes at the centre of their purchasing policy, The Warehouse are making a stand for the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cottonsoft are a subsidiary of the notorious conglomerate Asia Pulp and Paper (APP). APP have already been dropped as a supplier by major companies around the world, including Kraft, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Carrefour because of their reliance on rainforest destruction to make pulp and paper products (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, the Green Party and WWF-New Zealand are calling on all New Zealand retailers to stop stocking Cottonsoft and other APP Products until the company commits to ending rainforest destruction. They are also asking the public to use their consumer power to force Cottonsoft products off the shelves and have released a consumer guide to ‘rainforest friendly toilet paper’  &lt;a href="http://greenpe.ac/toilet-paper-guide" target="_blank"&gt;http://greenpe.ac/toilet-paper-guide&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests is one of the main threats to the survival of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, only 400 of which are estimated to remain in the wild. It is also an increasing source of conflict between tigers and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of rainforest are being cleared every year. Rainforest destruction is also acknowledged as a major driver of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warehouse Ltd has today confirmed that it will investigate information provided by Greenpeace New Zealand regarding the sourcing of product from Auckland based company Cottonsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Tuck, GM of Merchandise at The Warehouse, says, “While we thank Greenpeace for bringing this matter to our attention, it is a major decision to delist a supplier or product. This has wider implications including impacts on the jobs of New Zealanders and therefore not a decision to be taken lightly. However, due to the sensitivity of the issue The Warehouse will suspend all orders relating to this product range pending further information from all related parties.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam - Dhaka, 16 August 2011 -- At a ceremony in Singapore today, the iconic protest vessel, the Rainbow Warrior II was transferred to Friendship, a Bangladesh based NGO which will refit it for use as a hospital ship. (1)
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior II&lt;/em&gt; first sailed for Greenpeace in 1989 and replaced the original &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, after it was bombed and sunk by French Government agents, in Auckland harbour, in 1985.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 22 years of traversing the world’s oceans in defence of the environment, the ship will be renamed as &lt;em&gt;Rongdhonu&lt;/em&gt;, Bengali for Rainbow. The ship will serve the coastal belt of Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal delivering primary and secondary medical assistance to some of the most vulnerable communities of the world, communities that have little or no access to basic health care facilities. The Rongdhonu will also serve as an emergency medical ship around the region, enabling Friendship to bring medical aid to those areas which are already experiencing the effects of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, however, will not be long without a &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, as construction of a new &lt;em&gt;Warrio&lt;/em&gt;r, the third to bear the name, is nearly complete. (2) The vessel will join the Greenpeace fleet in October as the organisation celebrates its 40th anniversary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more than two decades the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior II&lt;/em&gt; has challenged the legal system and won, confronted environmental crimes, blocked shipments of illegal timber from the world’s rainforests, opposed nuclear weapons testing and sailed against over fishing, whaling, war, global warming, and other environmental crimes on every ocean. More recently, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; travelled to the waters off the coast of Fukushima and was used to carry out radiation sampling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friendship has worked for over a decade in Bangladesh, specialising in medical care and emergency relief. Currently it has two hospital ships. With cooperation of Friendship Luxembourg and Friendship Holland, Rongdhonu will be the third: its proud history campaigning for the environment will be turned towards health and human dignity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the hand over ceremony, Mike Fincken, Captain of the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior II&lt;/em&gt;, quoted the Cree Indian prophecy from which the ship got its name: “There will come a time when the Earth grows sick and when it does a tribe will gather from all the cultures of the world who believe in deeds and not words. They will work to heal it...they will be known as the "Warriors of the Rainbow’.” Adding, “This ship has carried people from around the world and has stood as an icon of hope over pessimism and as an emblem of action over complacency, it is time to pass that task on."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Runa Khan of Friendship said, “The &lt;em&gt;Rongdhonu’s&lt;/em&gt; primary goal would be to take up the baton and “Heal”. After decades of work in bringing global awareness to mankind’s consciousness, the &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt; as Bangladesh’s &lt;em&gt;Rongdhonu&lt;/em&gt; will bring relief during natural disaster and help ease the physical suffering and pain amongst communities which have no access to dependable healthcare. Friendship deeply believes ‘that no development intervention is possible when one is suffering’ and it is to ease such suffering, that the Warrior will strive to work towards, for its new life as the Rongdhonu.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the inauguration of &lt;em&gt;Rongdhonu&lt;/em&gt;, the ship will set sail to Bangladesh from Singapore and is expected to reach the Chittagong port during September 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Over the last decade, Friendship has worked in an integrated approach bringing health (directly to over 1.2 million beneficiaries), relief and disaster prevention, education, microfinance and preservation of culture in some of the most vulnerable regions of the planet. Friendship has specialised in working with communities at risk in various parts of Bangladesh, including the isolated chars of the Jamuna River, and cyclone affected areas in the Southern parts of the country. http://www.friendship-bd.org/therongdhonu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) As the first purpose built environmental campaigning vessel the new Rainbow Warrior will be one of a kind.

	Auckland 16 September 2011: This summer’s Arctic sea ice melt has been confirmed overnight (NZ time) as having been the second largest in recorded history, following 2007’s record melt (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Responding to the announcement by the US-based National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSDIC), Frida Bengtsson, expedition leader onboard the Greenpeace icebreaker &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;, at 80 degrees north said, “This is a clear signal of how climate change is causing the rapid shrinking of the Arctic sea ice cap”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued, “It not only has grave implications for the polar bears and other wildlife that depend on the sea ice, but for the planet as a whole - an Arctic free of summer sea ice could destabilise global weather patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till Wagner, ice scientist from University of Cambridge’s Polar Ocean Physics Group, (2) speaking from the Arctic Sunrise said, "What we can see is a staggering retreat in the ice. The speed and the scale at which the sea ice is diminishing cannot be explained by extreme weather conditions or similar theories. It is a direct consequence of global rising temperatures that lead to the heating up of the air and of the oceans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the news Greenpeace NZ Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer said, “This dramatic thaw sends a clear message to the New Zealand government that the setting up of new frontiers in extreme oil, Solid Energy’s preparations to dig up six billion tonnes of lignite in Southland, and Fonterra’s ongoing use of palm kernel, have all got to stop”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace icebreaker vessel the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is currently in the Arctic Ocean, with scientists from the University  of Cambridge’s Polar Ocean Physics Group, who are conducting research into the thickness and volume of the sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving and still images of the Arctic research work, and of the recreation of da Vinci’s sketch &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vitruvian Man&lt;/em&gt;,  created  last week on the ice by artist John Quigley, are available by calling Jay Harkness, Greenpeace NZ media and Communications, on 021 495 216.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer is available for interviews on 021 905 579.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Ice scientists Till Wagner and Nick Toberg from Professor Peter Wadhams’ team at the University  of Cambridge are testing the sea ice until September 24 2011. In an Arctic first, the scientists are working with professional 3D laser scanners from The Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London to investigate systematically the thickness and volume of the rapidly shrinking sea ice. In addition to the scanners, they are using power drills, coring, aerial imagery, snow depth measurements and GPS readings, to establish the average thickness, and other properties of the sea ice at 10 different sites. The data they collect will be used to verify other information from satellites and improve the accuracy of computer models.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 29 August, 2011 – Greenpeace launched a massive outdoor subvertising campaign in Auckland this morning, to expose Sealord’s sale of tuna caught using destructive fishing methods.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At daybreak more than 50 Greenpeace volunteers deployed hundreds of posters and banners along main routes into the city and throughout the city centre. The posters feature the new Sealord logo (1) along with the words ‘Nice Logo. Bad* Tuna. *Sealord’s canned tuna is caught unsustainably.’ To ensure all Aucklanders get the message a plane is towing a banner with the same message over the city and central suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists have also ‘converted’ the Three Kings water reservoir into a giant Sealord tuna can and labeled it ‘Bad* tuna’. A five-metre high shark fin protruding from the ‘can’ represents just one of the endangered ocean species at risk from destructive tuna fishing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re letting consumers know that Sealord is buying its tuna from fishing companies that are needlessly destroying marine life,” says Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today we are taking to the streets to let people know that behind Sealord’s new logo is a dirty fishing practice that is recklessly destroying Pacific sealife. Our message to Sealord is change your tuna not just your logo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is running a global campaign urging tuna brands to stop selling tuna caught by industrial fishing vessels using large purse seine nets set around fish aggregation devices (FADs) and to change to more sustainably caught tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna instinctively gather around FADs which also attract other ocean life including threatened sharks, juvenile tuna and even turtles which are then scooped up by the purse seine nets..Known by the fishing industry as ‘bycatch’ these creatures are often thrown back into the sea injured, dead or dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to information circulated by Sealord, bycatch of non tuna species is five to 10 times higher when purse seiners use FADs. This wasteful method also has a serious impact on tuna stocks, as juvenile and undersized tunas make up 15-20 per cent of the catch. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace launched its campaign calling on New Zealand’s main brands of canned tuna to stop selling tuna caught this way in April. Foodstuffs announced in June that it would change most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free by the end of the year. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite receiving more than 13,000 emails from concerned consumers Sealord are currently refusing to change their policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the UK’s major tuna brands, including John West, have committed to phase out the use of FAD-caught tuna and only sell more sustainably caught tuna.(4) In Australia the brand Fish 4 Ever uses only pole and line caught tuna, and a second brand has recently committed to shift its canned tuna range entirely to this more sustainable fishing method. (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of New Zealand’s canned tuna comes from the Pacific which, until recently, had the world's last healthy tuna fisheries. These are now under threat as industrial fishing fleets, which have exhausted tuna stocks in other oceans, are concentrating their efforts in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Pacific tuna stocks are in decline. Bigeye and yellowfin are the most at risk. Scientists have advised that fishing needs to be cut by up to 50 per cent in the Pacific to allow bigeye tuna to recover. (6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are close to 6000 industrial tuna vessels licensed to fish in the Western and Central Pacific region. In 2009 those vessels caught almost 2.5 million tonnes of tuna – around 60 per cent of the world’s tuna supply.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the government to come clean about exports of toxic waste from New Zealand to the Phillipines and South Korea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;OIA Documents passed to Greenpeace reveal that New Zealand has exported at least  50,000 tonnes of  toxic battery waste to the Phillipines and South Korea since the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that serious question marks exist about whether these exports are legal under both the international Basel Treaty and Waigani Treaty,  which make developed countries responsible for dealing with their own toxic waste rather than exporting it to countries where environmental  and safety standards are  lower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid said, “These revelations could threaten New Zealand’s image both as a clean green country and a responsible member of the international community”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If these deals are above board then why is the government withholding details of where in the Phillipines and South Korea our toxic waste is being processed?” Greenpeace is calling on the government to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the names of the waste facilities in both the Philippines and South Korea where New Zealand’s toxic waste is being processed and prove that their safety and environmental records were properly assessed before exports were approved. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put on hold any more exports of toxic waste until a full review of New Zealand’s toxic waste management policy has been completed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage development of a new state of the art recycling facility for New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms McDiarmid continued, “New Zealand has the moral responsibility to deal with its own toxic waste, not dump it on developing countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reality is we have the skills and technology to do this work cleanly and responsibly at home. The government should see this as an opportunity – to create new green jobs and investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What New Zealand needs is a new state of the art recycling facility and one that isn't right smack bang next to people’s homes and schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, The eight Greenpeace activists arrested before and during an occupation of a Shell-chartered drillship were today remanded at large for sentencing on September 14 at the New Plymouth District Court, after pleading guilty to charges of unlawfully being on a ship.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At a press conference held immediately after their appearance, the activists delivered a statement in which they affirmed their belief in their actions, and said they hoped that people around the world would continue to stand with them against Arctic oil drilling.  They also expressed their opposition to deep sea oil drilling, which could be happening off New Zealand’s coasts as early as this summer (2012).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven of the activists climbed the drilling tower of the Noble Discoverer on February 24, while it was berthed in Port Taranaki, being prepared for its journey to the Arctic. All were arrested after a 77-hour occupation of the tower. An eighth activist was arrested on the first day of the operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell is spearheading a push to exploit the Arctic for oil, as climate change causes the average summer sea ice to shrink rapidly. Shell’s aims are consistent with an industry-wide push into more and more extreme drilling environments, that also includes the deep waters off New Zealand’s coasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell is a part of a consortium that recently finished surveying the Great South Basin, off the South Island’s Otago and Southland coasts and also Stewart Island, while Anadarko, a shareholder in the Deepwater Horizon, has plans to start drilling in deep waters off the Canterbury coast as early as this summer. Petrobras may be drilling exploratory wells in the deep water off the East Cape by as soon as 2013. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The authorities would be virtually powerless to contain a deep water oil spill, just as the 6000 ships that responded to the Deepwater Horizon spill failed to stop the oil washing up on the shores of the Gulf states,” says Lucy Lawless, one of the activists who appeared today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Louisiana industries worst-affected by the Deepwater Horizon spill were tourism and fisheries, two industries that are key to New Zealand’s economy. The cost of a major spill in New Zealand to our coastlines, wildlife and economy, could be massive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The other activists and I hope that our actions will inspire others to put a stop to what Shell, Anadarko and Petrobras plan to do in New Zealand waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Like those in the Arctic, it is now time for people here to defend our precious coastlines from high-risk extreme oil drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Deepwater Horizon was an exploratory well, just like the ones that Anadarko plan to drill this summer. Once Anadarko starts work, we’ll be running the risk of a Gulf of Mexico-type disaster in our waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we allow the oil industry to do their bidding in these far flung reaches of the world, then we stand to see these places ruined by oil spills,” Lawless says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand is about to lose its chance to compete in the global clean energy revolution, as Pure Advantage highlighted in its report on Monday. If we act now, we’ll be helping the world escape runaway climate change, and we’ll be able to enjoy true prosperity,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	On 11 July 1985, news spread of dramatic explosions on the Auckland waterfront. Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow Warrior had been sunk while moored at Marsden Wharf. One crew member, Fernando Pereira, had been killed. Navy divers who retrieved his body at 4am discovered that the blast came from outside the hull of the ship and a murder enquiry was launched by New Zealand police.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Police investigation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police had a lucky break. On the evening of 10 July, two members of the Auckland Outboard Boating Club were watching out for people stealing boating equipment. At around 9.30pm, they saw a man in a wetsuit dragging a zodiac ashore after going under the Ngatipi Bridge on Tamaki Drive. The man was picked up by a couple in a Newmans Toyota campervan. One of the men took down the van's registration number and gave it to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="July 1985.  Auckland Harbour, New Zealand.Gaping hole inside of the Rainbow Warrior following bombing by the French secret service agents.COPYRIGHT 2005 GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP05MK_Medium_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="July 1985.

&lt;p&gt;After the bombing, the police were able to follow this lead, and when the couple went to return the van to the Newmans depot in Mt Wellington two days later, the staff delayed them long enough for the police to arrive. The couple were travelling on fake Swiss passports and would eventually be unmasked as French agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;French involvement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French government initially denied any involvement in the bombing. Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur continued to pretend that they were a Swiss couple on honeymoon. Over the following weeks, their story unravelled as their passports were shown to be forgeries. The police gradually uncovered evidence that would show a highly organised operation involving more than ten French agents. For two months the French government continued to deny any involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under pressure, the French government launched an inquiry to find out if French agents were responsible for the attack. This Tricot Inquiry would state that the agents in New Zealand were only spying on Greenpeace and did not sink the ship. The scandal intensified as the French media published further allegations about French involvement. The French Defence Minister, Charles Hernu, was forced to resign and the head of the French secret service (the DGSE), Pierre Lacoste, was sacked. On 22 September 1985, the French Prime Minister, Laurent Fabius, gave a televised address in which he revealed that French agents bombed the Rainbow Warrior and that they acted on orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Greenpeace archives: the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand public was outraged that France could carry out such an attack on New Zealand territory. Thousands of New Zealand men had died fighting to defend France during World War I and II and many were angry this was how a former ally was treated. Many New Zealanders were already angry about how France was continuing to test nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll. These tests were seen as a threat to the environment and the people of the South Pacific. People argued that if (as the French claimed) the tests were safe, they should be carried out in France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace gained huge sympathy over the bombing, and donations poured in. The fact that New Zealand’s traditional allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, did not condemn France’s actions caused further bitterness. Following this, the New Zealand government pursued a more independent stance in world affairs. In 1987, New Zealand passed the Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act. The bombing cemented nuclear free policies as part of New Zealand's identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Rainbow Warrior after the bombing " src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP0STOJSZ_Medium_res.jpg" alt="The Rainbow Warrior after the bombing " width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the bombing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two French agents were found guilty of manslaughter. The New Zealand judge sentenced them each to ten years’ imprisonment on 22 November 1985. The French government wanted its agents returned to France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1986, New Zealand farm produce exports began to face obstacles in the French markets. The New Zealand government feared that if its exports to the European Community were blocked, the New Zealand economy would be severely damaged. This situation led the two governments to come to an agreement with the help of the United Nations. The agreement, reached on July 1986, led to a French apology, compensation fee and an agreement not to interfere with New Zealand exports to Europe. In return, the agents would serve three years on Hao Atoll in French Polynesia. Many New Zealanders did not like this deal and the nation was outraged when France broke the agreement and brought the two agents back to France within two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sinking of the Rainbow Warrior failed to stop the protests at Mururoa Atoll. Greenpeace gained a huge amount of sympathy in New Zealand and around the world following the bombing, and if anything it had the opposite effect to what the French wanted. Fernando Pereira’s death made many protesters more determined to go and protest at Mururoa. Donations and offers of help continued to flood in. Greenpeace International was able to send its other large ship, The Greenpeace, to lead the protest at Mururoa Atoll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rainbow Warrior’s Peter Wilcox and Grace O’Sullivan boarded the Greenpeace yacht Vega and sailed to Mururoa to protest. They were arrested and deported. Bunny McDiarmid joined The Greenpeace and Lloyd Anderson joined the crew of the yacht Varangian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international attention gained from the bombing raised a much deeper awareness around the issue of nuclear testing amongst governments and people around the world. Indeed, the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior and the resulting international outrage would play a part in the decision by France to end nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Arbitration settlement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2 October 1987, an international arbitration tribunal sitting in Geneva, Switzerland ordered France to pay Greenpeace US$8.1 million in damages for deliberately sinking the Rainbow Warrior. France agreed to the arbitration after Greenpeace threatened to take France to court in New Zealand. This arbitration settlement was a very significant victory for Greenpeace, as it recognised the organisation’s rights under international law. According to their lawyer, Gary Born, the arbitration showed that “the law was not just something that protected smaller states, it also protected individuals and legal entities like Greenpeace”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace then had the funds to replace the Rainbow Warrior with the ship Rainbow Warrior 2, which would continue the campaign to protect the environment and raise awareness of critical environmental issues around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was towed north and scuttled at Matauri Bay. A memorial sculpture overlooks the water. Recreational divers are now able to admire the marine life surrounding the ship, that was used to protect the very creatures that now surround it. &lt;a title="Rainbow Warrior dive wreck" href="http://www.rainbow-warrior.info/"&gt;Click here for an interactive dive down to the wreck.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The pressure is mounting for New Zealand’s last coal fired power-plant, Huntly, to close its two remaining coal units in the wake of news that the world’s largest private sector coal company has just filed for bankruptcy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;US company Peabody Energy today announced it had voluntarily filed for bankruptcy amid depressed coal prices and plummeting use worldwide. Greenpeace New Zealand climate and energy campaigner, Jeff Harrison, says the news is a global signal that coal is no longer a viable source of energy, and demand is shrinking because it’s now significantly more expensive than wind and geothermal. “Here in New Zealand, the last coal units at Huntly must close. Coal is an industry that’s been on the brink of death for years. It’s completely dirty, dangerous and financially defunct,” he says. “But instead of having our best interests at heart, our electricity companies are holding back-door meetings in an effort to keep burning coal, even though cheaper sources of energy like wind exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August last year, Huntly’s owner, Genesis Energy, announced it would be closing the coal capabilities of the power plant by the end of 2018, saying New Zealand didn’t need it and it was too expensive to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electricity Authority agreed, saying the 2018 closure of Huntly’s coal wouldn’t result in a shortage of power, dry year or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison says Huntly’s coal could easily be replaced by a variety of smaller dispersed power sources like wind and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously cleaner, it’s cheaper for us, and it creates far more jobs than coal ever could. We live in 2016, and we live in New Zealand. Coal’s gotta go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three months ago it was revealed that several of New Zealand’s electricity providers, including Meridian Energy, had been meeting with Genesis Energy to find a way to keep the coal units running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison thinks the “electricity fat cats” are ganging together to keep coal alive because it’s easier for them to stick to the status quo and pass the higher costs onto consumers, rather than invest money in new power sources like wind farms, which in the long run would be cheaper for New Zealanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe those electricity companies have our best interests at heart,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In New Zealand, coal generates less than 4% of our power yet accounts for 28% of our pollution, and Huntly Power Station is the biggest single source of New Zealand’s emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So why, especially four months after we went and made a whole bunch of promises in front of the world at the Paris Climate Conference, are we fighting to keep a beast like this alive?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s shameful that our power companies are supporting dirty coal. They have a duty to us to look for cleaner and cheaper solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison says if Huntly’s coal burners were to shut, electricity providers including Meridian and Mighty River Power already have consents in place to start building wind farms around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13,500 people have signed &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=47701&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=greenpeace.org" target="_blank"&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; asking Genesis to stick to its plan and shut Huntly coal-fired powerstation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Right now, the world’s biggest seismic surveying ship is roaming our ocean. The Amazon Warrior, aka “The Beast”,  is here on behalf of Statoil and Chevron, and is blasting our seas  in a search for oil as the world faces a climate crisis. It’s madness.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need your help. Let’s make sure that every New Zealander knows these oil giants are putting our coastlines, marine life and climate at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And let’s make sure the oil giants know they’re not welcome.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imagine seeing thousands of signs on fences and in neighbourhoods across Aotearoa letting the big oil giants know that their climate-wrecking plans are not welcome in our waters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of how it could look for Big Oil. They’re planning to drill for oil in the deep sea. It’s dangerous, expensive and their potential customers are half a world away. But New Zealand is a friendly host. Their investment is safe here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Or so they thought. We’re showing them otherwise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few tips and templates for making an AWESOME sign for your garden, window, letterbox or fence!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/banner%20page/11005256875_a1b7d99a3d_b.jpg" alt="Ahead of the UN Climate Summit in Paris, 15,000 New Zealanders take part in the Peoples Climate March in Queen St, Auckland, kicking off what will be the largest climate mobilisation the world has ever seen.

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few tips and tricks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it yourself! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can tell that a lot of love and effort went into a homemade banner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure your call-to-action is defined&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;make sure your message is specific and on point with the cause. Some good examples are “Save Our Seas”, “Stop Statoil” and “100% Renewable”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have a projector, make good use of it&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you can hang the material you choose to use on a wall and then project your message onto it - it’s a fun and easy way make sure your design looks straight and symmetrical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling out your local politicians&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure decision makers get the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-985c7986-24f7-afb5-3a25-de1cd55349c8"&gt;Add a hashtag! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-985c7986-24f7-afb5-3a25-de1cd55349c8"&gt;Your sign will very likely end up on social media, so it’s always a good idea to connect to an online community with a hashtag, like #ClimateAction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using responsible materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hammer and nails, or some sturdy glue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some paint brushes of different sizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water-based paints or some thick markers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some kind of board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s lots of ways to get your materials for free or on the cheap by recycling other unwanted items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raid your recycling bin for some sturdy board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your local real estate agency if they have any old “for sale” signs—you can paint on the back!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit a building site and ask if they have any scrap wood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid VOCs and PVCs and don’t use treated wood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be sure to think about size and shape. You want enough room to fit your message, but if it’s too big, it’ll get in the way. If it’s too small it won’t be seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pick bright, contrasting colours as they’ll be seen more easily from farther away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan out your message ahead of time. Positive, funny, and interesting messages are more impactful than negative ones. Try to be catchy and clever and your sign will be more memorable—try alliteration or rhyme. Also make sure your message isn’t too long or people won’t read it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Check out some of these signs from protests earlier this year for some inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1.   Cut your board to the right size, if necessary.&lt;br&gt;3.   Paint a solid background colour on the board to cover any text or images. Allow to dry.&lt;br&gt;4.  &lt;span class="Apple-tab-span"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Use a pencil to trace your message and/ or images onto the sign. Stand back and make sure that it’s a good use of space and that it will be legible.&lt;br&gt;5.  &lt;span class="Apple-tab-span"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Use a smaller paint brush or markers to fill in your message.&lt;br&gt;6.   Display your sign proudly! Stick it on your fence or in your window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s up, take a photo of your handiwork and post it on Facebook or Twitter, making sure to tag Chevron and Statoil in your post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The oil giants came here thinking they could do their dirty business out of sight and out of mind. With your help, we’ll make that impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Tauranga, 23/07/12: The skipper of a Te Whanau a Apanui-owned fishing boat will appear in the Tauranga District Court today, to answer charges arising from his involvement in the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla off the East Cape last year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Elvis Teddy is facing charges of operating a vessel in an unsafe manner (under Section 65 of the Maritime Transport Act), and resisting arrest. His trial is set down for four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te Whanau a Apanui will be holding a protest rally outside the Court at 0830 hours Monday (today). Greenpeace representatives, and supporters, will be at the rally too, and will remain present for the length of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is here to support Elvis Teddy’s stand to protect his iwi’s waters and customary fishing rights from the threat of deep sea oil. Petrobras surveyed in up to 3100 metres of water off the Cape – more than twice the depth the Deepwater Horizon was operating in when it exploded and sank into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010,” says Carmen Gravatt, Campaigns Director at Greenpeace NZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An area twice the size of the North Island was closed to fishing following that disaster. If the same happened here, the people of Te Whanau a Apanui, not to mention anyone who makes a living, directly or indirectly, off this country’s clean green reputation, would be severely affected,” says Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Greenpeace, and a host of other regional deep sea oil and coal campaigning groups, will submit a 140,000- signature strong petition to Parliament calling for an end to the Government’s fossil fuels agenda, and for a clean energy future instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows a joint Greenpeace/Te Whanau a Apanui–initiated judicial review of the decision to grant Petrobras a drilling permit. This was made on the grounds that the Crown did not fulfil its Treaty of Waitangi obligations to consult with Te Whanau a Apanui, and because the then Energy and Resources Minister admitted that he did not consider the environment before he issued the permit. The joint-action sought to have the permit overturned; that was declined in June. An appeal against that ruling was lodged last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	This morning, on the ninth successive day of occupation, the remaining trio of originally four activists who ascended Marsden B early on the morning of Wednesday 16 -the day Kyoto came into force - will be descending from the roof of the dormant power station.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They are Kate Lowe (23 of Wellington), Malcolm Wren (35 of Auckland) and Raoni Hammer (23 of Christchurch). Another man had to return to ground on Friday for family reasons and is on bail awaiting a court appearance in Whangarei on 10 March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After extensive discussions last evening we determined that the best thing was for us to come down from the Marsden B rooftop today," said the activists, in a statement issued this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio have sustained the action with supplies hauled onto the roof at the time they ascended 9 days ago. They include: A solar panel that has enabled them to charge their phones, CB radio and laptops, water, food, 2 tents, a basic toilet facility, climbing gear and protest banners. All of which will be loaded down this morning as they descend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statement continues;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of climate change is a national and international issue of critical importance which requires urgent action now and that's why we took action to stop this coal fired power station. We did not do it lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are coming down for a number of reasons. Yesterday the Government finally responded to our request that the Minister call in the Mighty River Power application to recommission Marsden B as a coal fired power station, and turned it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are dismayed at the Governments lack of vision and leadership on the urgent issue of climate change, we are now taking the focus of our campaign to the Northland Regional Council. &amp;lt;&amp;gt;Today is the last day for public submissions against Marsden B. We want to deliver our own personal submissions to the council, along with the extensive Greenpeace submission against this coal project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proud of this occupation. We are awed by the strength of support weve got from the local community over the last nine days as weve sat on this rooftop. But what we've faced is nothing compared with what they face if this thing is fired up with coal, with toxic emissions spewing out over this beautiful landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a huge honour to be here. We are proud that our occupation has helped bring a national spotlight to this ludicrous proposal for a coal fired power station in this beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of the battle against Mighty River Power and Marsden B. We are only strengthened in our resolve to win this battle against the archaic use of coal for electricity generation. We want to again thank the community of Ruakaka and Whangarei and people all over the country and the world for their amazing messages of support. The weblog has been fantastic. And also our families and friends for understanding how important it is for us to take action against the destruction of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kia kaha - the fight continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Lowe, Malcolm Wren, Raoni Hammer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends.&lt;/p&gt;

	Busan, 8 August 2012 – Greenpeace says immediate action needs to be taken to halt the decline of tuna stocks in the Pacific. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The call was made at the start of  the 8th Scientific Committee meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC SC8) in Busan, South Korea this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is urging scientists at the Busan meeting to recommend that bigeye tuna catches be cut by 50 per cent. It is also calling for a ban on the use of destructive fish aggregating devices in purse seine fisheries and the creation of marine reserves in the Pacific Commons where all fishing activities should be banned. Final decisions will be made at WCPFC annual meeting in Manila this December.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Strong recommendations from scientists and commitments from government are both necessary to save the Pacific and the millions dependent on it for food and jobs. Time is running out for tuna, and for future generations, we need action now,” said Jeonghee Han, Oceans campaigner, Greenpeace East Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 150 scientists and representatives from WCPFC members including fishing powers such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines will review stock status information at the meeting concluding August 15. The current analysis shows that current fisheries management practices in the Pacific are failing to maintain healthy fish stocks fisheries and ocean ecosystems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three Greenpeace activists representing different generations held tuna images and delivered “No Fish No Future” messages as a warning sign to the delegations at the meeting venue. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans and for a more sustainable fishing industry, both necessary steps to restoring our oceans to health. Around the world, Greenpeace is working with retailers and tuna brands across New Zealand, Australia, Europe, and the Americas to increase the market share of sustainably-sourced tuna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace will use today’s monthly Hawke’s Bay Regional Council meeting to pressure councillors to scrap the Ruataniwha Dam.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Just over a month out from local elections, and in the wake of the gastro outbreak, this council does not have a mandate to allow the Ruataniwha dam to proceed, ” Greenpeace Agriculture Campaigner Genevieve Toop said from Napier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In light of what’s happened in Havelock North and people’s growing concern over water quality, we’re calling on the regional council to scrap the dam. It needs to start putting people’s health before industrial dairying."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ms Toop said one of the main purposes of the Ruataniwha Dam was to enable more industrial dairying in Hawke’s Bay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This will further pollute local waterways, and heighten the threat of Havelock North-type outbreaks.We cannot risk a repeat of what’s happened in the last few weeks.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is not alone in calling on the council to drop the dam. Over the last week, five and a half thousand people from around the country have emailed the councillors asking them to halt the scheme, in order to prevent more pressure on New Zealand’s waterways (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“People are putting two and two together, and realising that big irrigation schemes like Ruataniwha increase the risk to New Zealand’s waterways,” said Ms Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the risks, the Government is throwing over half a billion taxpayer dollars at industrial irrigation schemes, not just in the Hawke’s Bay but across the country, and local councils are pouring in millions of dollars of ratepayers’ money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should be cleaning up and protecting our rivers and water supplies, not building giant irrigation schemes that will further pollute them,” said Ms Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, Thursday 26 July 2012: Today in the Tauranga District Court, Justice Treston threw out charges against Elvis Teddy, the fisherman who used his small boat to oppose the Government’s plans to allow deep sea oil drilling in his fishing grounds off the East Cape, last April.  Teddy was a part of the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla that at the time was protesting a deep sea survey being undertaken on behalf of the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace celebrates Elvis Teddy's acquittal after a year of  uncertainty and stress for Elvis, his family and Te Whanau a Apanui, and thanks them all for the frontline-stand they have taken, and continue to take, against deep sea oil exploration and drilling," says Simon Boxer, Senior Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under orders from Wellington, the Navy and the Police were being used to prevent the Stop Deep Seas Oil Flotilla from protesting outside New Zealand's territorial waters , when the Police arrested Teddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Judge ruled that the section of law the authorities were operating under had no jurisdiction past 12 nautical miles from the coast, yet the policewent ahead anyway and arrested Elvis," Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet again the Government's desire to kowtow to international oil giants has led it to shoot first and ask the hard questions later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's  dirty  fossil fuel agenda is riding  roughshod over the rights, values and concerns of New Zealanders as well as its Treaty and international obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Government wants to have it both ways: on one hand it illegitimately extend its authority beyond 12 nautical miles to stop peaceful protest, while at the same time it is pushing the deliberately weak EEZ Bill through Parliament, after the  oil permits have been granted, which does not even meet New Zealand's obligations under the International Law of the Sea - let alone protect our coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Government is being reckless in taking risks with our economy, our coastline and way of life, in opening up our waters to deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So far the Deepwater Horizon disaster has cost the United States economy $US40 billion. It forced the authorities to close off an area to fishing twice the size of the North Island. Such a disaster off our coast would be devastating to our economy, and have a severe impact on many industries, especially tourism and fishing, as well as severely damaging our international reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Government's fossil fuel agenda is causing New Zealand to miss out on billions of dollars of clean energy contracts and thousands of jobs. To ignore the financial opportunities for New Zealand arising from the global clean energy revolution, that last year was worth over US$250 billion (1), is nothing short of economic mismanagement," Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has sent a ‘please explain’ note to the Government over its woeful record on climate change, rivers and oceans.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Jan Wright has released her commentary today on the Government’s 2015 State of the Environment report – Environment Aotearoa 2015. It shows that on almost every measure possible, our environment has gone from bad to worse under John Key’s Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand’s Executive Director, Russel Norman, says Dr Wright has now formally asked the Government to explain how they plan to respond to the worrying findings in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The PCE is asking a pointed question on behalf of all New Zealanders: Now that we have some of the statistics on the growing disaster on climate change, freshwater, oceans, and biodiversity, what will the Government do to actually turn it around?,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The problem we have is that government policies on many of these issues actually make things worse.The current policy of subsidising massive uneconomic irrigation schemes, for example, increases climate pollution and water pollution simultaneously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Government subsidies for oil, gas and coal also increase climate pollution, Norman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He’s pleased to see some difficult questions posed to the authors of the 2015 State of the Environment report in Dr Wright’s commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“She asks why NIWA statistics on water quality were blended together in a way that could hide the terrible pollution in our rivers and aquifers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It appears the Government authors of the report had been combining data from monitoring sites in the high country where the water is pristine, with data from increasingly polluted lowland rivers, to make it inaccurately seem overall that there was no trend in water quality decline.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Norman says it’s “not good news for New Zealand” when it comes to reporting on water quality, the 2015 State of the Environment report is no better than the last one, which was published in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Controversy surrounded the 2007 report after it was revealed that the Ministry for the Environment had suppressed a chapter on water quality from the public, a chapter which Norman then released after it was leaked to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Until we have a State of the Environment report which is genuinely independent of Government, issues like these will continue to dog the reporting. It is good to see that as a start, the Parliamentary Commissioner Dr Wright is asking some of the hard questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, February 27th 2012 — The occupation of an Arctic-bound Shell drillship by six Greenpeace activists including actor Lucy Lawless ended this morning after police climbed the ship’s drilling tower and arrested the group. The protest was into its fourth day and the activists had spent 77 hours on top of the 53 metre drilling tower.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This chapter has ended, but the story of the battle to save the Arctic has just begun,” said Lucy Lawless, before being arrested. “Seven of us climbed up that drillship to stop Arctic drilling, but 133,000 of us came down.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued, “We will continue to stand in solidarity with the communities and species that depend on the Arctic for their very lives until Shell cancels its plans to drill in this magical world, and makes the switch to clean, sustainable energy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists entered the Port of Taranaki at 6:30 a.m. on February 24th, scaled the drilling tower of the Shell drillship the Noble Discoverer and set up camp. The ship was preparing to leave for the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska where it is scheduled to drill three exploratory oil wells this summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In these four days we have shone a global spotlight on Shell’s reckless plans to destroy the precious wild Arctic for just a few years of oil,” said Viv Hadlow, one of the drillship activists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued, “It’s insane that oil companies like Shell regard the melting of the Arctic sea ice not as a warning to humanity, but as a chance to drill for more of the oil that caused the problem in the first place. Today this occupation ended, but like the hundreds of thousands of people who have joined our cry to save the Arctic, we will not be silenced.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the four day occupation, more than 130,000 people sent an email to Shell executives telling them to cancel their plans to drill in the Arctic, causing Shell email systems to overload repeatedly. Thousands of people around the world also sent messages of support to Lucy and the activists via social media and the hashtag #SaveTheArctic, which featured on banners hung from the drillship, has trended on and off around the world over the past 4 days. Celebrities like Jared Leto and the official Beatles twitter account also posted messages to their followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I can’t wait to get home to my kids to tell them all about this amazing journey, but I’m so glad I took part in this peaceful action,” said Lucy Lawless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued, “I am in awe of the multitudes of people who have sent us so many inspiring messages of support, not to mention my fellow activists who put their personal liberties on the line to stand up to Shell’s mad plans to drill in the Arctic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We did what we came to do. Together we sent a clear message that has been heard and echoed across the globe: there’s no place in this world for your reckless Arctic oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell is the first major international oil company to make exploitation of the Arctic a major focus. If the Noble Discoverer strikes oil this summer, other global oil giants will quickly follow and spark an Arctic oil rush. The company has a very tight window in which to drill for oil. Freezing temperatures, extreme weather conditions and a highly remote location pose unprecedented challenges, and make an Arctic oil spill virtually impossible to contain and clean up. (1) According to a senior official at a Canadian firm that specialises in oil-spill response, “there is really no solution or method today that we’re aware of that can actually recover [spilled] oil from the Arctic.” (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total estimated Arctic oil reserves would satisfy just three years of current global oil demand, but would both contribute significantly to carbon emissions and pose a grave risk to the local ecosystem. (3) Numerous reports show that through energy efficiency and clean energy, global energy needs can be met while leaving the Arctic untouched.

	Actor Lucy Lawless and Greenpeace New Zealand activists this afternoon vowed to continue their occupation of Arctic bound Shell drillship Noble Discoverer into a third day.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Aucklander Ilai Amir was forced to end his involvement in the occupation this afternoon for personal reasons (1).  Before climbing down he said "I'm proud of what we've achieved here and I will still be with the team in spirit, as they continue to make sure that Shell hears the message loud and clear: the world does not want your reckless Arctic oil."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The remaining five activists and Lawless have vowed to fight on. They remain camped out on the top of the ship's 53 metre drilling tower and intend to stay put for a second night. They are calling on Shell CEO Peter Voser to cancel its plans to open up the Arctic to oil drilling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the activists boarded the ship yesterday morning over 96,000 people worldwide have emailed the Shell CEO asking him to drop the company's Arctic oil drilling plans. It has also captured media attention across the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting from the top of the Nobel Discoverer Lucy Lawless said, "Shell has said that they are very disappointed with Greenpeace for launching this direct action. Well we're disappointed that they are planning to drill in the pristine Arctic. And overnight 96,000 people have written to Shell to express their disappointment."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Shell use words like 'safe' and 'environmentally responsible' but this is laughable. The fact is that if drilling is allowed to go ahead it's not a question of if there will be an oil spill in the Arctic, it's a question of when".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Photos and video from this morning are available for download from the Greenpeace on request.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contacts:&lt;br&gt;For more information call the onsite press officer on 021 4952 16 or Greenpeace New Zealand Press Office on 09 630 6317 x 310.&lt;br&gt;(1) Ilai Amir will not be available for interviews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Greenpeace briefing on Shell's Arctic plans can be found at: &lt;br&gt;(1) &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org.nz/briefing/Shell_and_oil_exploration_off_Alaska.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://greenpeace.org.nz/briefing/Shell_and_oil_exploration_off_Alaska.pdf &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 30 August 2012 - Greenpeace activists blocking the world’s second largest factory fishing trawler, the FV Margiris, from arriving in Australia this morning have revealed that two New Zealanders have a controlling interest in the ship.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The activists are calling on the Australian Government to refuse to grant a fishing license to the FV Margiris and introduce a policy to ban all super trawlers from Australian waters. Super trawlers use an indiscriminate fishing method which can decimate fish stocks and kill turtles, dolphins, seals and other marine animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These ships literally vacuum up entire schools of fish. You could fly a Jumbo Jet through the opening of its net with room to spare,” said Greenpeace Australia and Pacific Oceans Campaigner Nathaniel Pelle from a Greenpeace inflatable alongside the Margiris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter and Donna Simunovich are major shareholders of the joint venture which is operating the Margiris in South Australian waters. Peter Suminovich, who managed his family’s company Simunovich Fisheries before it was sold to Sanford, is also a director of one of the two companies in the joint venture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Simunovich brings shame on New Zealand by their involvement in this death-ship the Margiris.  Australians are rightly outraged.  We should also renounce these super trawlers and ban them from our waters,” said Greenpeace New Zealand Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Wherever these super trawlers go, they leave devastated fisheries in their wake. They have overfished European waters, collapsed fisheries in the South Pacific, and devastated fishing communities in West Africa. We simply can’t let the same thing happen in Australia,” said Pelle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Australian Government has the power to stop the Margiris before the plunder begins. Tens of thousands of Australians have already told the Government to stop the super trawler, and public outrage from a broad range of communities - from environmental groups to recreational fishermen - continues to grow at the Government’s failure to act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Australian marine life does not stand a chance against this kind of vessel – and neither do Australian fishermen,” said Greenpeace CEO David Ritter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even research (2) cited by the owners shows that despite new technology, many animals, including fur seals, will routinely be killed in its nets. Both the Environment and Fisheries Ministers are rightly expressing serious concerns, but now, with this ship already in our waters, time is running out for them to display some common sense and refuse to grant a license to the Margiris . Allowing it to fish in Australian waters is not just against the national interest, it is simply absurd.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace ‘No Super Trawler’ petition is available at: www.greenpeace.org/australia/no-supertrawlers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)    The Margiris is being operated by a joint venture between Seafish Tasmania and Seafish Tasmania Pelagic, a fully owned subsidiary of Parlevliet &amp;amp; Van der Plas BV. Seafish Tasmania Pty Ltd company information sourced from company extract purchased from ASIC and current on 23rd of August 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)    Seafish Tasmania are claiming they have trialled new seal excluders that will be fitted to the Margiris. However research Seafish are relying upon does not support their arguments. During the research observers estimated 55 seal deaths and 20 injuries for 97 trawls. That's more than one seal killed for every 2 trawls. Moreover, the study was conducted on a vessel almost a third the size of the Margiris.

	Auckland 1/8/12: Greenpeace is hailing the news of the cancellation of an exploratory deep sea drilling operation - set for this summer - as the clearest sign yet that the Government must give up its single-minded fossil fuels agenda, in favour of winning New Zealand a place in the global clean energy race. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Anadarko, which had a 25 per cent shareholding in the well beneath the Deepwater Horizon - which exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 - announced early this morning (NZ time) in an investor relations teleconference that it wouldn’t be bringing a deep sea rig to New   Zealand until the end of 2013. The company was originally planning to start drilling at several sites off  the Raglan,  Canterbury and Otago coasts in the summer of 2011; that was then delayed to this October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its expedition was to be the first in a wave of exploratory deep sea drilling programmes, planned by Shell, Petrobras, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These constant delays send a clear message; that rather than sitting on its hands, waiting for the dangerous deep sea oil industry to come, the Government should be looking to secure truly sustainable prosperity, by capitalising on our world-beating clean energy know-how,” says Simon Boxer, Greenpeace NZ Senior Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the global clean energy sector, last year alone, has been put at US $250 billion  (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a fact that the exploratory phase is the most dangerous of the entire deep sea drilling process,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For that reason, it’s great news for New Zealanders, our beaches and our economy that Anadarko isn’t coming this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anadarko says that it hasn’t been able to find a rig. That’s rubbish. If they wanted to be here, they would be. The company has contracted numerous rigs for exploration around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What they are not saying is that while the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico is challenge enough, New Zealand’s exposed waters and limited infrastructure means that the technical challenges of drilling here - relative to what they think they will find, simply don’t add up,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This news comes a week after Greenpeace, and a host of other groups, delivered a 140,000-signature strong petition to Parliament,  that demanded a clean energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Deepwater Horizon disaster, an area twice the size of the North Island was closed to fishing in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A similar disaster here would devastate our economy, scaring off tourists, closing fisheries, and doing permanent damage to our clean, green reputation, which sells so many New Zealand products overseas,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It took almost three months to shut down the well below the Deepwater Horizon. It would take far longer to control a blowout here, especially as it could take months for another rig - most likely from South East Asia – to arrive in order to drill a relief well,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company has been complaining about New Zealand’s proposed regulations in the media, which is standard operating procedure for the oil industry. But the reality is that in some respects, drilling in New Zealand has been even more poorly regulated than in Nigeria. That won’t change much at all with the EEZ bill that’s going through Parliament at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At any rate, no amount of regulations will ever stop an oil spill,” Boxer says. &lt;/p&gt;

	The World is witnessing a historic, global shift in the way we power our homes our businesses and our economies. Climate change is here. How we respond is the only question that remains.

	Auckland 10/9/2012: The Shell-chartered drillship the Noble Discoverer – which actor Lucy Lawless and six other activists occupied for four days in New Plymouth in February - has begun drilling in the Chukchi Sea, off the coast of Alaska, overnight New Zealand time.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Shell is leading a push by the world’s oil ‘supermajors’ to advance into the Arctic, as climate change causes the Arctic ice cap to shrink (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last month the Arctic summer melt ate further into the ice cap than at any time since satellite monitoring began in 1979. The previous record was set in 2007, in mid-September, when the minimum ice extent is usually reached; the Arctic could still shrink even more than it already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago the typical size of the Arctic ice cap at this time of year was around the same as Australia. Currently, the ice extent is only half that size. Some scientists are predicting than within a matter of years, it could disappear completely during the summer months (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell’s drilling plans have been dogged by a series of incidents, including when the &lt;em&gt;Noble Discoverer&lt;/em&gt; dragged its anchor and almost ran aground, and delays around emissions consents, and the certification of an oil spill response barge. As a result, the company is now planning to only make a start on drilling, and only on a single well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shell’s embarrassingly problematic summer should serve as a warning to investors across the world. From human errors to fierce storms, the company has ably shown that it is woefully unprepared to operate in the Arctic, one of the world’s most hostile environments,” says Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spending $4.5 billion to conduct just preparatory work on a single well is not only a poor return on investment; it poses a serious threat to the company’s global reputation,” Naidoo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all need to protect the Arctic to safeguard the way we live, given that the Arctic acts as a giant air conditioner for our planet, reflecting sunlight back into space,” says Greenpeace New Zealand’s Nathan Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since June, nearly one and a half million people have signed a Greenpeace petition calling for the High Arctic to be designated an internationally-protected region (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell now faces a race against the clock to complete its work before the 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of this month, when its permit stipulates that it must stop operations because of the risk from ice floes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven activists who helped launch Greenpeace’s campaign to save the Arctic by occupying the &lt;em&gt;Noble Discoverer&lt;/em&gt; (and an eighth man who was arrested before the occupation began) will be sentenced in the New Plymouth District Court this Friday, September 14.&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington, 12 November 2012 – Fifty-five original artworks, representing the estimated number of adult Maui’s dolphins left alive, were presented to key MPs today to highlight that the future of the dolphin, which faces extinction, is in their hands.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;It's in Your Hands&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Art of Survial Collection
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;Greenpeace is calling for an immediate and extended ban on gillnets, set nets and trawling – the main threats to Maui’s dolphin – throughout its habitat along of the west coast of the North Island from Maunganui Bluff (north of Dargaville) to Whanganui, including harbours and extending to the 100 meter depth contour.
&lt;p&gt;The edition of 55 handmade woodblock prints were produced by Wellington-based artist Sheyne Tuffery. They feature Maui’s dolphin and a tuatara – another New Zealand species to have faced extinction and now considered a national treasure. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 55 prints represent the alarmingly small Maui’s dolphin population. As there are more MPs than adult Maui’s dolphins we aren’t able to give a print to every politician,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace invited representatives of all the political parties including Prime Minister John Key and 41 National MPs to today’s art presentation. Only 4 MPs attended the formal event. The remaining 51 prints were delivered by Greenpeace and the artist to the Beehive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas says the symbolism of the artworks will depend on the Government’s response to the Maui’s dolphin crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If MPs take urgent action to protect Maui’s dolphin they will be able hang these beautiful prints in their offices with pride. It will be the art of survival. On the other hand, if they’re too slow or if the measures they agree are too weak, they’ll have a constant reminder of their failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maui’s dolphin, the world’s smallest and most endangered marine dolphin, is found only in New Zealand waters. The latest population estimate indicates 55 adult Maui’s dolphins remain. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two international expert bodies, the International Whaling Commission and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, have called on New Zealand to take immediate action to protect the critically endangered species. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government’s response has been shamefully inadequate. New Zealand is running a very real risk of becoming the first country to oversee the extinction of a marine dolphin from human causes,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That would be a huge blow to New Zealand’s strong record for wildlife conservation, and to our international reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions on the Government’s plans to handle the threats to Maui’s dolphins closed yesterday. More than 17,600 Greenpeace supporters alone made submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington, November 16, 2012 - Greenpeace New Zealand has won its case to have its charitable status reconsidered.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal today set aside an earlier ruling by the defunct Charities Commission declining Greenpeace charitable status and said that decision should now be reconsidered by the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are delighted that the Court of Appeal has recognised that promoting both peace and nuclear disarmament is for the public benefit,” says Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court has confirmed that the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is also in the public benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace was denied charitable status in 2010 when it applied to the then Charities Commission. It ruled Greenpeace’s promotion of disarmament and peace was a political purpose that was not "charitable" under the Charities Act 2005. That decision was upheld by the High Court last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McDiarmid says today’s ruling provided more clarity on what it meant to be a charitable organisation promoting causes such as peace and nuclear disarmament in the 21st Century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We will always remain non-party political promoting good environmental outcomes supported by nearly 60,000 Kiwis.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	“We are proud to have taken part in our attempt to stop Shell’s reckless plans to drill for oil in the pristine Arctic." - Lucy Lawless
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Plymouth, 7 February 2013&lt;/strong&gt; – Film and TV star Lucy Lawless and seven activists were today convicted and sentenced to 120 hours community service each and for attempting to stop an Arctic-bound oil drilling ship last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with six Greenpeace volunteers, the New Zealand actress occupied the Shell-chartered &lt;em&gt;Noble Discoverer&lt;/em&gt; in New Plymouth last February in a move that captured headlines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking outside Taranaki District Court, Lawless said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are proud to have taken part in our attempt to stop Shell’s reckless plans to drill for oil in the pristine Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since we occupied the Noble Discoverer, it has become evident to everyone watching, from the millions who have signed Greenpeace petitions, to the US Government, now examining Shell’s plans, that it can never be safe to drill in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shell’s Arctic programme has cost them billions and it’s now regarded as an eye-wateringly expensive failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s embrace clean energy; we’re going to have to anyway, so why not do it before they cause a major oil spill in the Arctic, and consign our grandchildren to an uncertain and dangerous world?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawless and six others climbed the drilling tower of the &lt;em&gt;Noble Discoverer &lt;/em&gt;on February 24, 2012 while it was moored in Port Taranaki. All were arrested after a 77-hour occupation of the tower. An eighth person was arrested on the first day of the operation. The ship had been working off the Taranaki coast and was preparing for the first stage of its trip to the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Lawless, the others sentenced today were Raoni Hammer from Lyttleton, Mike Buchanan from Diamond Harbour, Shayne Comino from Lyttleton, Viv Hadlow from Auckland, Shai Naides from Spain, Zach Penman from Hamilton and Ilai Amir from Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional they were ordered to pay a total of $5210 in reparation to the Port of Taranaki. The court declined to entertain Shells claims for damages totalling about $650,000 which lawyer for the group, Ron Mansfield, said was “excessive and unjustified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In July the Noble Discoverer slipped anchor in the sheltered waters of Dutch Harbor, Alaska;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In November the engine of the drill ship caught fire as it returned to Dutch Harbor, and had to be put out by specialist fire crews;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In December it was revealed that the oil spill containment system that Shell was supposed to have on-site in the Arctic was badly damaged in September testing. A Federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement representative said that the sub-sea capping stack was “crushed like a beer can”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 31 December, Shell's sister Arctic drilling oil rig, the Kulluk, ran aground off the coast of Alaska whilst being towed back to harbour in Seattle. It had hit heavy weather in the Gulf of Alaska a few days earlier which caused the 400ft towing line to break and the rig to drift free;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2013 Shell were cited by the US Environmental Protection Agency for violating its air pollution permits for both drill vessels;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in January, the US Government launched a review of Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Auckland 24/9/12: Responding to the concerns raised by the Kyoto Forestry Association about the Government’s proposed amendments to the Climate Change
Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Bill,
Greenpeace Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer said:

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Yet again we've seen another broken promise from John Key's Government to take action and reduce pollution. By gutting the Emissions Trading Scheme any progress to tackle climate change will be drowned out by the sound of chainsaws, as trees fall to be replaced by industrial dairy farms -  and more emissions."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; "This is just another example of the Government writing laws to suit the country's biggest polluters, to the enormous cost of ordinary New Zealanders," he continued.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; "The Government needs to kick-start the move towards a cleaner, smarter way of doing business. Making polluters pay for the damage they do to our air and our land will ensure a brighter future for us all."&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, February 27th 2012 — The occupation of an Arctic-bound Shell drillship by six Greenpeace activists including actor Lucy Lawless ended this morning after police climbed the ship’s drilling tower and arrested the group. The protest was into its fourth day and the activists had spent over 77 hours on top of the 53 metre drilling tower.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activists are currently being processed by police and are expected to be available to comment briefly to media once they are released. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the fact that the charge of "unlawfully being on a ship" was available, prosecutors have chosen to charge the protestors with the more serious charge of burglary.  Greenpeace insists that no property was taken or damaged during the occupation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “This chapter has ended, but the story of the battle to save the Arctic has just begun,” said Lucy Lawless, before being arrested. “Seven of us climbed up that drillship to stop Arctic drilling, but 133,000 of us came down.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued, “We will continue to stand in solidarity with the communities and species that depend on the Arctic for their very lives until Shell cancels its plans to drill in this magical world, and makes the switch to clean, sustainable energy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six activists who were arrested this morning are: &lt;br&gt;Mike Buchanan from Christchurch. &lt;br&gt;Shayne Comino from Christchurch. &lt;br&gt;Raoni Hammer from Christchurch. &lt;br&gt;Shai Nades from Wellington. &lt;br&gt;Vivienne Hadlow from Auckland.&lt;br&gt;Lucy Lawless from Auckland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Jersey, 15 July – As the 63rd annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission came to a close in Jersey, a day that saw pro-whaling member nations leave the meeting to avoid voting on the creation of a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary, Greenpeace UK oceans campaigner Willie Mackenzie issued the following statement:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Instead of the historic creation of a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary, which is backed by most member countries, the impasse created today by pro-whaling nations has caused this IWC meeting to end in acrimony. Latin American countries have waited a decade for this sanctuary that has once again been blocked due to Japan and its allies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While petty politics continue to prevent progress, no concerted international action can be taken by the IWC to conserve the world’s endangered whale populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yesterday, the IWC adopted new rules to stop cash payment of member dues, which will hopefully mean a new era of transparency for the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The move to ban cash payments means that at last the International Whaling Commission can be dragged into the 21st Century and will make it difficult for pro-whaling nations to buy votes. This is the first welcome step towards the IWC functioning as an organisation that works for the whales, and not the whalers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to all commercial whaling in all of the world’s oceans. Earlier this week, two Greenpeace activists unjustly convicted in September 2010 for exposing embezzlement and corruption inside Japan’s whaling industry had their conviction upheld in an appeal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, July 15 2011: Greenpeace NZ is calling on the Government to stop being secretive about what appears to be a major back-down in its plan to open New Zealand up for offshore deep-water oil exploration.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A deliberately muddled statement (1) has appeared on the Ministry of Economic Development’s website, saying that: “Both Northland and Reinga Block Offers attracted interest from local and international companies but no permit awards were announced.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two deep water Block Offers were made in January 2010 and closed in August last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government appears to be hiding a back-down,” says Steve Abel, Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’ve called the Ministry today. A spokesperson there has refused to deny that they have backed down on the permitting of these blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That person also wouldn’t clarify if the negotiations are ongoing, or if they have been withdrawn altogether,” Abel says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The spectre of oil spills off Northland’s Ninety-Mile Beach is not something the Government wants going into an election. Therefore we believe that the Government has decided that pursing its strategy for oil exploration off Northland is too politically poisonous - and has therefore climbed down in the face of public opposition,” Abel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a style="color: #33464c;" href="http://www.nzpam.govt.nz/cms/petroleum/blocks-offers/results-of-petroleum-blocks-offers" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nzpam.govt.nz/cms/petroleum/blocks-offers/results-of-petroleum-blocks-offers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note to editors;&lt;br&gt;In January last year, then Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee described the upcoming block offer in these glowing terms: "This is an exciting opportunity for New Zealand and explorers alike.&lt;br&gt;It is one of the most prospective frontier basins in the New Zealand region with all the elements required for an active petroleum system present over a large area."&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 17 July, 2011 - Greenpeace is heralding the pulling of the Northland and Rienga blocks as another success in the nationwide campaign to ensure deep sea oil drilling does not occur in New Zealand waters. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace received confirmation from the Ministry of Economic Development late Friday evening that here will be no oil exploration permits issued for the Northland and Reinga blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These blocks were touted as the jewels in the crown of New Zealand’s oil prospects and yet not a single permit has been issued across the dozen blocks covering 150,000 square kilometres of Northland’s coastal and offshore waters,” says Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting Energy and Resources Minister Hekia Parata stated only a few weeks ago that the announcement of permit awards was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Either the industry has lost its mettle or the Government has. Whichever one, the wheels are coming of Brownlee’s grand oil plans,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suspect that public pressure has lead to both industry reticence and the Government pulling the blocks in the full knowledge that there is as much community opposition to high risk deep-sea oil drilling off Northland’s precious coastline as there is to drilling in the East Cape and Golden Bay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace pursued MED for more information on Friday after spotting the  posting of an opaque statement buried on the MED website on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent statement emailed to Greenpeace reads, “New Zealand Petroleum &amp;amp; Minerals completed its block offer process for the Reinga and Northland basins. This process did not result in an award of a permit, despite a high level of technical interest from investors at an early stage in the process”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government needs to urgently re-think its economic development strategies and invest in clean, locally produced energy solutions that provide more jobs per dollar invested and better economic security. The Government should not be at loggerheads with local communities which are fighting to stop the risk of oil washing up on their beaches,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Seismic testing in the Raukumara basin by Brazilian oil giant Petrobras is apparently finished weeks ahead of schedule after a 42 day flotilla protest in April and May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Grey Wolf withdraws its application (in June) for permits to mine and drill in Marlborough’s Golden Bay region citing strong public outrage at the plans as the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Deep sea exploratory drilling in the Canterbury basin by Texan oil company Anadarko that was expecting to be occurring early in summer this year appears to be delayed according to industry media reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The long anticipated announcement of permits for the Northland and Reinga blocks is dropped in place of a quiet web posting on 15 July of a statement that no permits are to be issued for any of the dozen blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 21 September 2010 – Following new evidence, Greenpeace demands that Fonterra and the Government put an end to New Zealand’s importation of palm kernel grown on areas of destroyed rainforest.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Deforestation in Indonesia is driving climate change and pushing endangered species like the orang-utan to the brink of extinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twelve months after Fonterra’s connection to the palm industry was exposed by the ‘Sunday Star Times’ and Greenpeace, the dairy giant has strengthened its association with the clearing of Indonesia’s rainforests by increasing imports of palm kernel to feed its dairy herd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand returned to Indonesia in September 2010, this time to what was once a rainforest in East Kalimantan, cleared by a palm products company. Photos and video of the newly cleared rainforest were shot by the Greenpeace New Zealand team over the weekend and can be viewed at http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/fonterra. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace documentation team of seven, including New Zealand citizen and Greenpeace New Zealand Communications Manager Suzette Jackson, was arrested at 3.30pm on Sunday local time. They were held and interrogated by police in the nearby town of Sangatta and released 23 hours later without charge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fonterra has implicated New Zealand in this shocking aspect of the palm industry through its unnecessary use of palm kernel,” says Jackson. “I’ve worked for Greenpeace for nine years, but I've never seen anything quite like this … the landscape’s been razed. It’s heartbreaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The fact that we were arrested for simply documenting the destruction of rainforests to grow palm products shows just how much the currently unsustainable industry has to hide.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This site, or concession, is typical of the currently unsustainable practices of the palm industry. Now being cleared by Sinar Mas, this area of rainforest is thought to be part of one of the last refuges for the critically endangered orang-utan. A High Conservation Value Assessment is required to meet Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards. Yet despite Sinar Mas’, subsidiary PT SMART (which own the concession the Greenpeace team visited last weekend), being a member of the RSPO, there is no sign of any such assessment having been performed for this concession. The recent audit showed that eight of 11 Sinar Mas concessions examined were operating illegally without the required Environmental Impact Assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As the palm industry opens up new frontiers across Indonesia, companies like Fonterra, which is expected to spend NZ$230 million this year buying up a quarter of the world’s palm kernel, is helping to fuel this destruction,” Jackson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to recent estimates, Indonesia is the third largest greenhouse gas polluter of any nation on the planet, largely due to the destruction of its rainforest and peatlands. (2) Clearing massive tracts of forest also has a major impact on wildlife diversity, and creates social conflict with indigenous communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s a scandal that Fonterra continues to feed its dairy cows a palm industry product that is often sourced from companies that are destroying rainforests and peatlands thereby increasing climate change - and that this Government has done nothing to stop that, ” Jackson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rapid industrialisation of dairying in New Zealand, driven by Fonterra, is driving the increased use of palm kernel as a supplementary feed. Greenpeace New Zealand maintains that relying on pasture and local alternatives for emergency drought relief, such as maize silage, which is grown by New Zealand farmers, are the best options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year it is expected New Zealand will import well over one million tonnes of palm kernel for Fonterra’s farms. (3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This flies in the face of the actions taken by other companies. For example, a number of international corporations, including Nestlé, Kraft, and Unilever have recently dropped contracts with Sinar Mas due to its environmentally destructive practices, and Burger King has committed to removing Sinar Mas products from its supply chain in response to a recent auditor’s report into Sinar Mas’ activities. (4) Meanwhile, Cadbury New Zealand has publicly stated that it stopped using palm oil in its Dairy Milk products after a consumer campaign led by Auckland Zoo to withdraw the confectionary giant's products from sale. (5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fonterra is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage as companies like these respond to public concerns over the worst environmental impacts of the palm products industry,” says Jackson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fonterra’s half-owned subsidiary, RD1, has a joint venture with international palm oil and palm kernel producer and trader Wilmar – the company International Nutritionals Limited. It is estimated that Wilmar buys over half its palm products from third parties. (6) Wilmar has no systems in place to ensure that suppliers involved in rainforest destruction, like Sinar Mas, are excluded from its supply chain. Palm kernel expeller is then supplied by companies in New Zealand, such as RD1, to Fonterra farms here in New Zealand. (7)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealanders should be alarmed that for short-term financial gain Fonterra is risking New Zealand’s clean green reputation by being associated with some of the world’s most notorious rainforest destroyers,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling upon the Indonesian Government to expand its recently announced moratorium on the granting of new concessions for conversion to cover vast areas of rainforest that have already been slated for destruction under existing concessions. Greenpeace is also calling for all the country’s peatlands to immediately be protected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra has apparently 'pulled the plug' on its Facebook page, rather than answer the questions being submitted to it by members of the public on the company's use of palm kernel expeller (PKE).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The questions were sparked first by Greenpeace NZ's &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/news/Fonterra-implicated-in-rainforest-destruction-again/"&gt;trip to Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; in September to document the ongoing destruction of South East Asia's rainforests by the palm products industry and then by a spoof milk ad dubbed "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvLsAMsOJM"&gt;The milk ad they don't want you to see.&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace had been encouraging its supporters to ask the company to explain its actions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fonterra has failed to account for the fact that the vast majority of its PKE comes from deforested land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Social marketing is something that most large corporates are now engaged in. But Fonterra's extraordinary refusal to answer questions on its use of palm kernel has forced it to remove itself from this increasingly important arena. It's bizarre," says Dmitry Kuznetsov, Greenpeace New Zealand Online Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon Boxer, Greenpeace New Zealand Senior Climate Campaigner, says "Fonterra's refusing to front up because they know that - despite all their excuses - using palm kernel helps cause deforestation, and that makes the climate crisis even more serious. What's worse, many of the rainforests of South East Asia grow on peatlands, and they also store carbon - unless they're drained to grow palm."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on Statistics NZ figures, more than a million tonnes of PKE is expected to be imported into this country this year. Fonterra's farmers are expected to spend NZ$230 million on the feed this year, much of which will wind up in the pockets of those ordering the bulldozers into the forest habitats of species like the orang-utan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only six per cent of the palm products industry's global output is grown according to the industry's weak sustainability standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fonterra's farmer shareholders buy almost a quarter of the global supply of PKE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has created an alternative Facebook page for Fonterra, which can be found here:&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fonterra-Brands/161596240541568" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fonterra-Brands/161596240541568&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Google cache of Fonterra's defunct Facebook page can still be found &lt;a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LEvc0SRZFYwJ:www.facebook.com/pages/Auckland-New-Zealand/Fonterra-Brands/18612072906+fonterra+facebook+page&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=nz&amp;amp;client=firefox-a" target="_self"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace's spoof Fonterra TV advertisement can be viewed here: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvLsAMsOJM"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvLsAMsOJM &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is urging Fonterra not to ignore the important discussions about the links between sustainability, climate change, and dairying that will be taking place at this week’s World Dairy Summit.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The summit has been organised by the International Dairying Federation.  It starts tomorrow (Monday) at Auckland’s Skycity conference centre.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Fonterra placed prominent newspaper advertisements over the weekend of  6-7 November, claiming sustainability as one of its core concerns.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But while Fonterra is positioning itself at the Summit as the  do-no-wrong darling of the New Zealand economy, Greenpeace says the  reality is one of corporate mismanagement, manifested by a short-sighted  lack of concern for the environment - which happens to form the  backbone of Fonterra’s marketing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The advertisement’s claims of sustainability aren’t worth the newsprint  they’re printed on. Fonterra’s mantra is ‘production at any cost,’ as  demonstrated by its actions,” says Greenpeace New Zealand’s Senior  Climate Campaigner, Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Fonterra’s palm kernel feed comes from an industry that is worsening  the climate crisis as it clears South East Asia’s rainforests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “To make things worse, Fonterra insists on burning coal in its dehydrators,” says Boxer.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Meanwhile, every New Zealander knows that freshwater quality has taken a  dive in the nine years that it has taken Fonterra to industrialise  dairying in this country.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Fonterra then has the cheek to use this country’s clean green  reputation to sell its low-value bulk dairy products,” Boxer says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent will be attending the  conference to contribute some of Greenpeace’s expertise in climate  change issues. Greenpeace regularly takes part in such conferences, both  here and overseas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ends&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace’s Q and A on palm kernel can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/Palm-Kernel-Expeller-Q--A1/" target="_blank"&gt;www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/reports/Palm-Kernel-Expeller-Q--A1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Aomori, Japan, September 6, 2010 – Greenpeace has condemned as disproportionate and unjust a one year jail term, suspended for three years, imposed on two Greenpeace activists, who exposed widespread corruption in the Japanese government’s Southern Ocean whaling programme.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were today convicted of theft and trespass after carrying out a public interest investigation into embezzlement, during which they intercepted as evidence one of numerous boxes of whale meat coming from the whaling factory ship the Nisshin Maru and destined for private use, which breaches the regulations of the taxpayer-funded programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to the verdict Sato said, "While the court acknowledged that there were questionable practices in the whaling industry, it did not recognise the right to expose these, as is guaranteed under international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on which our defence was based, supersedes domestic criminal law, but the judgement did not properly take this into account."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “This sentence is totally disproportionate and completely undeserved,” said Suzuki. “We set out to reveal the truth about the government’s whaling programme, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the news of the verdict Greenpeace supporters hung black flags and banners outside Japanese embassies around the world, to signal that the judgement cast a dark shadow over democracy and civil rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following their arrest in June 2008, Sato and Suzuki were subjected to a 26-day detention, that the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (1) considered a breach of their human rights and politically motivated, followed by a two-year prosecution. During the trial, whalers and whaling officials consistently contradicted their own and each others' evidence about  the embezzlement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the case, international law expert and defence witness in the case, Professor Dirk Voorhoof of Ghent University, Belgium, stated “The Tokyo Two’s treatment was already a violation of international human rights law. While a suspended sentence is preferable to a jail term, it still constitutes a further failure to respect the rights of two activists who should never have been arrested and charged in the first place. It also discourages other organisations and journalists from investigating and reporting misconduct by the authorities.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case of Sato and Suzuki has generated significant international attention, from senior political figures, including Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, international human rights groups and legal experts (2). During a visit to Japan earlier this year, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, Navi Pillay, expressed concern about the case particularly with regard to freedom of expression and association.  She emphasised the importance of investigations by NGOs to society in general and how their work should be respected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy,” said Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr. Kumi Naidoo, who travelled to Japan to hear the verdict. “The freedom to peacefully expose wrongdoing is not only a crucial part of any democracy, it is a right that must be defended. Greenpeace will continue to make this case a global priority until this unjust conviction is overturned.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is an independent, global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment, and to promote peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) In March 2009, Amnesty International lodged a complaint about the treatment of Sato and Suzuki to the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The Working Group asked the Japanese government to explain its actions, however, the authorities limited their response to explaining Japan's criminal justice system and claiming, without substantive explanation, that the complaint was unfounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Working Group did not concur, stating that the Japanese authorities have breached articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18 and 19 of the ICCPR. It also expressed concern that articles 2, 10 and 14 of the ICCPR, relating to the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial, have not been respected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full opinion can be found here: http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two/wgad-opinion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) http://www.greenpeace.org/international/t2-statement-of-concern/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In January 2008, Greenpeace began an investigation into insider allegations that organised whale meat embezzlement was being conducted by crew inside Japan's so-called ’scientific‘ whaling programme, which is funded by Japanese taxpayers. The informer was previously involved in the whaling programme, and following his advice Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki began an investigation, eventually discovering firm proof that cardboard boxes containing whale meat were being secretly shipped to the homes of whaling fleet crew - and then sold for personal profit. Junichi delivered a box of this whale meat to the Tokyo Prosecutors' Office in May 2008, and filed a report of embezzlement. However, the embezzlement investigation was dropped on 20 June - the same day that both men were arrested and then held for 26 days, 23 of which were without charge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 13, July, 2011 – Greenpeace today condemned Japan’s ongoing disregard for international human rights law, following the Sendai High Court’s decision to uphold convictions handed down to anti-whaling activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The decision comes in spite of an official admission of wrongdoing by the Fisheries Agency of Japan in December 2010, and strong evidence supporting the activists’ allegations of criminal embezzlement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known as the Tokyo Two, Sato and Suzuki were convicted of “theft and “trespass” (1) by the Aomori District Court in September 2010, after they exposed broad scale embezzlement in Japan’s whaling industry, The court rejected all of the arguments presented by the defence, upheld the unjust convictions handed down by the Aomori court, and gave no clear reasoning for its decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court did not acknowledge that the substantial evidence showing the occurrence of embezzlement, and it did not take the right to investigate and criticise such practices into proper consideration,” said Junichi Sato, defendant and Greenpeace Japan Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Above all, the court did not take into account the damning admission by the Fisheries Agency of Japan, and its apology for its officials’ acceptance of expensive, illegal whale meat gifts from the fleet operators (2) – in quantities far greater than we were convicted of taking.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have proven our case and the FAJ has admitted wrongdoing, yet we are still being punished for standing up to corruption, while those behind the real crime walk free,” said Sato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For too long bureaucrats have had very cosy relationships with destructive industries, and as&lt;br&gt;we have seen with the IWC vote buying scandals (3) and TEPCO’s single-page nuclear meltdown response plan for Fukushima Daiichi (4), both have had severely negative effects on the environment, the people and the economy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government can no longer ignore the embezzlement we exposed. It must fully investigate the whale meat scandal, finally end its support for the expensive, unwanted and unneeded whaling programme, and put the money wasted on it into recovering from the March 11 disaster, and rebuilding sustainable fishing communities along the East coast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato called on the International Whaling Commission, which has started its 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; annual meeting, in Jersey, to end commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, July 13th 2011: Greenpeace activists displayed a banner with the message ‘Detox’ at the main entrance of both the world's largest Adidas store and a nearby Nike store today in Beijing, calling on the sportswear giants to remove toxic chemicals from their supply chains and from their products. The demand comes as the result of a year-long Greenpeace investigation into toxic water pollution in China. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace International ‘Dirty Laundry’ report, launched today at press conferences in Beijing and Hong Kong, found hazardous chemicals in samples of wastewater discharges taken at two textile processing facilities: the Youngor Textile City Complex, and the Well Dyeing Factory Limited, by the Yangtze and Pearl  river deltas. Both have links to a number of major international and national clothing brands (1) including Adidas, Nike and the Chinese Li Ning. The findings follow the earlier publication of ‘Hidden Consequences,’ which highlighted the impacts of industrial pollution on rivers around the world (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is challenging the clothing brands named in this report to eliminate releases of hazardous chemicals from their supply chain and products, and we are calling on trendsetting brands that have a major influence on their supply chains, such as Adidas and Nike, to take the lead,’ says Yifang Li, Greenpeace East Asia Toxic Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemicals found in the sampling carried out by Greenpeace include persistent and bioaccumulative hormone disruptors that pose long-term threats to the environment and to human health (3), (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings give a snapshot of the kind of toxic chemicals that are being released by the textile industry into waterways all over the world and are indicative of a much wider problem that is having serious, long-term and far-reaching consequences for people and wildlife," says Martin Hojsik, Coordinator of the Toxic Water campaign at Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the moment, none of the brands highlighted in the report have a complete overview of the chemicals being used and released in making their products. The solution to this problem is the adoption of comprehensive chemicals management policies, which will enable these companies to systematically monitor, reduce and eliminate hazardous chemicals throughout their supply chain,” adds Hojsik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also calling on governments to take action and work towards the elimination of hazardous chemical discharges within one generation. "Policy makers have a choice. They can continue exposing their citizens and the environment to the risks created by the release of these toxic substances or they can set stringent regulations that systematically reduce and eliminate hazardous chemicals while supporting sustainable innovations," concludes Hojsik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is asking supporters and consumers to challenge major brands to ‘Detox’ their supply chain and products and to champion a toxic-free future. For more information visit http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/campaigns/toxics/water-detox/ .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary and the full report are available at http://www.greenpeace.org/dirtylaundryreport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)    Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch, Adidas, Bauer Hockey, Calvin Klein, Converse, Cortefiel, H&amp;amp;M, Lacoste, Li Ning, Meters/bonwe, Nike, Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation (PVH Corp), Puma and Youngor. When confirming their commercial relationship with the Youngor Group, Bauer Hockey, Converse, Cortefiel, H&amp;amp;M, Nike and Puma informed Greenpeace that they make no use of the wet processes of the Youngor Group for the production of their garments. However, regardless of what they use these facilities for, none of the brands found to have commercial links with these two facilities have in place comprehensive chemicals management policies that would allow them to have a complete overview of the hazardous chemicals used and released across their entire supply chain, and to act on this information. See page 38 of the Dirty Laundry report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)    http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/Hidden-Consequences/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3)    Among the numerous chemicals used and released by industry, persistent substances - such as heavy metals and some hazardous organic chemicals - are a source of particularly high concern.  What makes many of these chemicals so dangerous is that they are not only persistent (meaning that they do not readily break down in the environment), but also bioaccumulative, (meaning that they can build up in the food chain and can have serious, long-term effects on the organisms that ingest them). Some are able to interfere with hormone systems in people and wildlife, even at very low doses, while others are carcinogenic or reprotoxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Among the chemicals found in sampling: alkyphenols (including nonyphenol), perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) and perfluorooctane sulphorate (PFSs) For more detailed information on the specific chemicals check box 4.3, of the ‘Dirty Laundry’ report, page 78). Previous Greenpeace investigations have also detected the persistent and hormone disrupting pollutants alkylphenols and PFCs in fish species along the Yangtze River: http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/press/reports/swimming-in-poison-yangtze-fish&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 15 November 2012 – Greenpeace has welcomed Pure Advantage’s Green Growth report saying its vision of building a prosperous economy by protecting the environment offers a smarter alternative to the Government’s current polluting policies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Nathan Argent, Greenpeace New Zealand Chief Policy Advisor says the report shows there are huge opportunities for New Zealand in moving to a cleaner, smarter way of doing business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By setting New Zealand on a pathway to clean up our economy and supporting our wealth of clean energy innovators we can repair the damage done by our most polluting industries and build a healthier and wealthier nation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Argent says the report challenges the Government’s current ‘growth at any cost’ agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That’s not a plan. It’s an economic wrecking ball. The question now is whether economic Tsar Steven Joyce can rise to the challenge and put in place a much needed plan to kick start a cleaner, smarter economy in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“So far Joyce’s business growth agenda has delivered the highest unemployment figures in over a decade, dismantled our manufacturing base and tied our growth to the whims of overseas oil companies whilst risking our coastlines with oil spills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It achieves nothing more than a race to the bottom of the economic pile while we continue to see New Zealand’s economic performance slip and pollution rise.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a title="Pure Advantage Report" href="http://www.pureadvantage.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Pure Advantage report&lt;/a&gt; shows some of New Zealand's key trading partners, such as China, Korea and Australia, are already putting in place the building blocks of a clean economy and emerging stronger and healthier from the global financial crisis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="HTTP://WWW.GREENPEACE.ORG.NZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVE UPDATES HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MV Great Motion has 10,000 tonnes of palm kernel on board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is at anchor just outside the Port, where it had been waiting for another ship to unload its palm kernel and depart a berth used for unloading the animal feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The action is being carried out to force the Government to put a stop to Fonterra’s expanding use of palm kernel (also know as palm kernel expeller), which is typically grown on land cleared of rainforest, which often includes orang-utan habitat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Palm kernel linked to deforestation and peatland destruction poses a significant risk to New Zealand’s economy, as it undermines this country's international clean green reputation, because of its impact on the climate, and rainforests. Reliance on supplementary feeds like palm kernel commits New Zealand to a dairying model that is completely unsustainable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Why is the Government not doing something, when Fonterra has effectively admitted that the vast majority of their palm kernel is unsustainable (1),” says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government is failing New Zealand and the world by not taking Fonterra to task over the economic and climatic damage done by the company’s use of palm kernel in New Zealand, and by Fonterra’s industrialized approach to dairying. Palm kernel imports linked to deforestation and peatland destruction must be stopped immediately,” says Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Palm kernel imports are soaring, hitting a record high of almost 1.4 million tonnes during 2010, for which Fonterra is estimated to have paid a quarter of a billion dollars, according to Statistics New Zealand. This represents almost a third of the global trade in PKE (2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Palm kernel shipments are literally lining up to come into the country – with a total of three shipments through Port Taranaki this week alone – a cargo of 31,000 tonnes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Time is running out for Fonterra and the Government. If both continue to refuse to act, then Fonterra’s international consumers will likely take action of their own accord. Consumers around the world are increasingly interested in the climate and environmental impacts of the products they buy,” Argent adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tropical forest destruction is responsible for around a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supplementary feeds like palm kernel are a key part of Fonterra’s industrial farming approach, which is increasing climate emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fonterra’s claims that palm kernel is sustainable are false. Only six per cent of the global production of palm products is grown according to the standards of the industry body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which are not strong enough,” Argent says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeding stock on pasture, using locally grown emergency alternatives to palm kernel (such as maize silage), and moving from the current industrial farming model to low impact practices, are the best options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting our international brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In August 2009 a team from Greenpeace New Zealand travelled to Indonesia to document the destruction being done by the palm industry there. Later the same year Greenpeace stopped a shipment of palm kernel in Tauranga, and painted a message on the side of another palm kernel ship in New Plymouth. In September 2010, Greenpeace returned to Indonesia to gather evidence of how the palm industry was opening up new frontiers of destruction. This evidence was later delivered directly to Fonterra's headquarters in Auckland, and to politicians in Wellington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professional-standard moving and still vision of the activists will be available later this morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The document continues on to say that Fonterra is a member of the RSPO “to ensure we are informed on sustainability issues in South East Asia and to actively contribute to more robust sustainability certification systems”, yet also acknowledges that “there is more work to be done which is why we are closely involved with the RSPO”. Fonterra goes on to say that the palm kernel its subsidiary RD1 imports is from Wilmar International and that “Wilmar is on target to complete certification audits for all their plantation operations by 2014,” meaning that Wilmar’s plantations currently have no sustainability certification. It is estimated that Wilmar buys over half its palm products from third parties.

	Auckland, 4 December 2012 – Greenpeace says Sealord must follow its competitor, Australian brand John West, which has just announced it will stop using destructive tuna fishing methods that needlessly kill sharks, rays, baby tuna and turtles.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a statement released earlier today (1), John West, Australia’s largest tuna brand, pledged to phase out the use of highly destructive and wasteful fish aggregating devices (FADs) used with purse seine nets by 2015. This will include John West tuna sold in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes John West the third of the five major tuna brands sold in New Zealand to respond to a Greenpeace campaign to end destructive tuna fishing. Sealord, New Zealand’s largest canned tuna brand, is refusing to take the same steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas says the John West commitment is another important step towards halting the decline in tuna stocks and protecting the marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John West has joined the growing ranks of progressive tuna companies around the world who are providing consumers with the sustainable tuna they demand. It’s very disappointing that Sealord, New Zealand’s largest canned tuna brand, thinks it knows better and is ignoring this urgent ocean need and sustainability trend,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an increasingly lonely CEO who stubbornly refuses to stop sourcing from destructive fishing, risking lasting brand damage as they are left behind by other companies that are determined to make their products sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar commitments to phase out FADs with purse seine nets have already been made by all brands and major retailers in the UK, and Safeway in the US. Many other retailers and brands around the world are currently making progress to remove purse seine FAD-caught tuna from their supply chains.(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand Foodstuffs has changed most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free and added a range of tuna caught by pole and line – a lower impact type of fishing. Greenseas, owned by Heinz in Australia, and also sold in New Zealand, has committed to phase out purse seine FAD-caught tuna by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The John West announcement comes just as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission meets in Manila in the Philippines to discuss extending FAD bans in purse seine fisheries and other measures to rescue the world’s largest tuna fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship Esperanza has just arrived to Manila after a one-month expedition in the waters of Palau and the international waters known as the Pacific Commons. The expedition revealed illegal and unsustainable fishing activity including 33 FADs – 12 of them deployed illegally in Palau's waters (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific scientists this year advised that a total ban on FADs combined with greater regulation of longline fishing in spawning areas would be the most effective way to save the overfished Pacific bigeye tuna.(4) The use of FADs with purse seine nets results in a high catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas as well as sharks, rays, and endangered sea turtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace’s campaign to halt the decline in Pacific tuna stocks is the subject of a one-hour documentary titled ‘Karli Thomas and the Raiders of the Last Tuna’ which will premiere on TV1 tonight, December 4, at 7.30pm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	In 2012, the Rainbow Warrior undertook a 9-week expedition through the Indian Ocean's fishing grounds, and the Esperanza undertook a 3-week expedition in Pacific Commons Area 1 and the EEZ of Palau. Both expeditions documented fishing operations; here are summaries of their findings.

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Ocean is the second most important tuna fishing ground in the world, with approximately 24% of the world's tuna catch. Fishing capacity in the region is already estimated to be more than what the fish stocks can sustain in the long term. Yet, many coastal states are allowing more and more vessels to enter the fisheries, using various types of gears including large-scale driftnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Case Studies in our Rainbow Warrior Indian Ocean Expedition report raise a number of concerns, and highlight the urgent need for better management of fishing fleets in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 60% of the world's tuna is caught in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. Industrial fleets from distant water fishing powers take the overwhelming majority of this catch. As demand for tuna grows, that proportion is increasing. Due to the lack of monitoring, control and surveillance capacity, foreign fishing vessels use the high seas to launder fish out of the region. Key areas are becoming safe havens for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 8 December 2012 - Governments charged with protecting fish stocks in the Pacific are allowing the continued plunder of the region's declining bigeye tuna stocks while also putting yellowfin, skipjack and albacore tuna at risk of overfishing, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the international body that sets the rules for tuna fishing in the region, finished a five-day meeting in Manila late Thursday night (NZ time). The annual meeting involved more than 30 countries from the Oceania region, Asia, Americas and Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacific scientists this year advised that a total ban on fish aggregating devices (FADs) combined with greater regulation of longline fishing in spawning areas would be the most effective way to save overfished Pacific bigeye tuna(1). Greenpeace was also calling  for marine reserves to be established in four high seas pockets known as the Pacific Commons. These conservation measures, among others, were rejected by the WCPFC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lagi Toribau, head of the Greenpeace delegation to the WCPFC says the meeting was a disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The big corporate players won and will continue their plunder for short-term profits at the expense of our oceans’ health,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The governments here should be held accountable for failing to protect vulnerable species that form the backbone of many economies in the Pacific, and provide food and livelihoods to coastal communities across the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Politics once again have failed our oceans. The onus now is on consumer markets to demand sustainable products on the shelves. By rejecting tuna caught by purse seiners using FADs and switching to more sustainable methods, consumer action can rescue our oceans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this week John West, Australia’s largest tuna brand, pledged to phase out FAD-caught tuna (2). Two other brands sold in New Zealand have made the same commitment with Foodstuffs changing about 85 per cent of its Pams range to more sustainably caught tuna. Greenpeace is urging New Zealand’s largest tuna brand, Sealord to do the same or better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shark conservation was also on the WCPFC agenda. The meeting agreed to end the practice of setting nets on whale sharks and using them as living FADs but rejected a Pacific Islands proposal to ban shark finning at sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace ship Esperanza arrived in Manila, ahead of the WCPFC meeting, after a one-month expedition in the Pacific region which revealed illegal and unsustainable fishing activity (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s campaign to halt the decline in Pacific tuna stocks was the subject of a one-hour documentary which premiered on New Zealand television earlier this week.

	Lyon, 27 February 2013 – As Interpol convenes its first meeting to address the illegal fishing crisis, Greenpeace renewed its demand to end illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, calling for stricter enforcement and the elimination of loopholes in regulations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As back up to its call, Greenpeace released the detailed documentation of illegal fishing activities encountered during two ship expeditions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans in 2012 highlighting the need for urgent action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that governments prohibit the transfer of fish at sea, end fishing vessels’ ability to hide in ports or under flags of convenience, require identification devices such as AIS and improve at-sea control and enforcement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Illegal fishing continues to expand and much of what happens at sea stays at sea and escapes all control,” said Sari Tolvanen, Greenpeace International oceans campaigner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is estimated that between $10 and $24 billion worth of fish is illegally taken from our oceans every year – often from developing nations and supported by sophisticated transnational networks of criminals. Tuna fisheries and the global trade in shark fins are prime examples of this organised crime.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As overfishing decimates fish stocks, fleets are moving further and further from homeports to catch valuable fish species such as tuna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the ship expeditions in late 2012, Greenpeace International encountered fishing vessels from Japan, Taiwan and Sri Lanka engaged in illegal or suspicious fishing activities in the Indian Ocean. In the Pacific, Greenpeace International witnessed Asian vessels fishing illegally in international waters, taking advantage of poor at-sea enforcement and loopholes in the law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results of each expedition will be made available to law enforcement officials at the Interpol meeting and will also be delivered to the relevant fisheries management authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Illegal fishing cannot be stopped through stricter law enforcement alone: fishing quotas must be set at sustainable levels. Given the lucrative global tuna market and the decline in tuna populations, illegal fishing is increasingly profitable,” added Tolvanen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is advocating that more financial and human resources be allocated to control activities at sea and along the chain of custody, and that loopholes such as transfer of fish at sea be banned accompanied by steep cuts in industrial fishing capacity that lead to illegal and overfishing. Interpol can take a lead by enabling the sharing of data and best practices, and push for strict enforcement and proper prosecution of individuals and companies in involved in illegal fishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a more sustainable fishing industry and a global network of fully protected sanctuaries at sea, both necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans for future generations. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ship tour findings reports can be found at: &lt;a title="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Oceans-Reports/Ocean-Expeditions-2012/" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Oceans-Reports/Ocean-Expeditions-2012/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Oceans-Reports/Ocean-Expeditions-2012/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s announcement of cuts to the Department of Conservation, Nathan Argent, Greenpeace’s senior policy advisor, said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is an assault on our Kiwi values. Anyone who loves walking in our countryside, swimming in our seas and playing with the kids on our beaches should be appalled at this attack on the very things New Zealanders hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"John Key doesn’t want to protect the water we swim in, the air we breathe and the countryside in which we tramp. He doesn’t want to protect our wildlife, our birds and our trees. He wants to flog them off to the marketing and PR departments of foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dozens of hard-working men and women will lose their jobs, and they’re the people who are out there every day protecting our wildlife. Today’s cuts are terrible news for them, and terrible news for our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"John Key should be hanging his head in shame. Our country become a little poorer today."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	We're excited to announce the winner of our youth flag design competition, run in collaboration with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. The winning flag design will be planted on the seabed at the North Pole next month! 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But before we show you a video of Vivienne Westwood choosing the winning design -- let's meet the judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Aishah Morshed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I feel honoured to represent Girl Guides and Girl Scouts around the world as a judge for Flag for the Future. Recently I took part in another competition at school to design couture fashion made from recycled materials and now I find myself travelling to meet one of the world's top designers who also really cares about the planet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I am one of the millions of people who have signed the 'Save The Arctic' scroll because I fear for the animals that might become extinct and the exploitation that would occur in the Arctic if we don't take action. I can't bear to think about an Arctic without polar bears and icebergs with their beautiful colours and patterns. The Arctic is very far away from my home in Ireland but it is still my responsibility and the responsibility of everyone in the world to make sure that it becomes a global sanctuary."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We need to move towards an energy revolution where sustainable forms of clean energy can fuel our future.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Vivienne Westwood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The creativity of young people is one of the most powerful tools we have to build a better world. The winning flag for the future is a fantastic representation of peace, hope and global community, and I am proud that it's on the way to the North Pole."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dame Vivienne Westwood was born Vivienne Isabelle Swire in Glossop, Derbyshire, UK on 8th April 1941. She began designing in 1971 along with her then partner Malcolm McLaren when London was at the forefront of cultural trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the seventies Vivienne Westwood was already considered a symbol of the British avant-garde and punk movements. Vivienne Westwood is now recognized as a global brand and Westwood herself as one of the most influential fashion designers in the world today. Vivienne Westwood today continues to show all over the world including in Paris, Milan and London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses the medium of her shows to talk about culture and politics, more specifically about the urgent need to act against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Raquel Nuttall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Judging the flag for the future has made me think a lot about the use of symbolism in different cultures. For example the colour blue is a symbol of peace and also known to keep bad spirits away. The flag must be global and I wanted to keep in mind that not every country has the same meaning of doves or rainbows. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I was looking for a flag that made me feel peace, hope and unity. I also wanted a design that made me feel empowered and stirred up inside because we are working together to care for our planet and for the Arctic and together I hope that we will achieve peace."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raquel is an artist and carver from the Inuvaluit First Nations community in Canada. Her work draws heavily on symbolism and she is particularly interested in the challenges and issues faced as a young Inuvialuit women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes to to bring strength, courage, peace, and if possible a bit of inspiration to those that come into contact with her pieces. Raquel has worked at the Inuvik Youth Centre where she encourages young artists to pursue training. As well as being a celebrated sculptural artist she also speaks at conferences on the issue of Indigenous rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Having experienced its breath taking beauty first hand, I am extremely concerned for the future of the Arctic. As the sea ice retreats and the oil industry moves north, it is crucial that the youth of today continues the ongoing effort to protect this pristine wilderness and oppose those who seeks to exploit it. Therefore I am thrilled to be part of the 'Flag for the Future' project and look forward to reviewing the entries."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian has been with Greenpeace for six years, as a volunteer, activist and employee. He is currently Lead Creative at Greenpeace Nordic. Christian has a bachelor's degree in Visual Communication from Danish School of Media and Journalism and has studied Graphic Arts and Design at the Leeds School of Contemporary Art &amp;amp; Graphic Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has participated in a number of offshore Greenpeace actions against Arctic oil drilling, including last years attempt to stop a Shell-commissioned icebreaker from reaching it's Chukchi- and Beaufort Sea drill sites.

&lt;p&gt;A professional artist from north of Canada, John is known for distinctive modern Aboriginal designs. Adopted as a child, John began searching for his birth parents as a young adult. This journey has lead him to rediscover his roots in the community of the Chipewayne Dene First Nation peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His painting style reflects the harmony of the Dene people with their surrounding way of life and natural environment. John also tries to inspire other upcoming aboriginal artists through creative workshops. His work has been featured in shows and exhibitions across Canada, including as part of the 2010 Olympic games.&lt;/p&gt;

We need to protect the Arctic because it is the home of many indigenous peoples and many animal species. It should be declared a global sanctuary. I found out about the competition during my Environmental Journey in India visit last December at Sangam, World Centre of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. After looking at a photo of the two brave Girl Guides taken in the Arctic, I decided to do my little part by participating and supporting the campaign to Save the Arctic. This is a golden opportunity for me to send the message of hope and peace to the rest of the world. We can only save the Arctic for the future generations if we are united in peace and harmony."~^~^/new-zealand/ReSizes/ImageGalleryLarge/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/FlagForTheFuture/winner Sarah Malaysia.jpg~^350350'&gt;

	Auckland, 20 March 2013 – Sealord is now the only big Australasian canned tuna brand which has refused to stop using a destructive fishing method which kills sharks, juvenile tuna and turtles, Greenpeace warned today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Recently Aldi (1) became the last of the main Australian tuna brands which promised to stop using a fishing method which kills around 200,000 tonnes of other marine life every year. (2) Four of New Zealand’s five main brands have already made a similar pledge along with all the major UK major tuna brands and retailers plus Safeway in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Sealord says it will continue to source its tuna from boats using fish aggregating devices (FADs), which attract tuna and many other species, along with purse seine nets which let nothing escape.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Sealord should have led the way in ending this deadly practice. Now, it’s the lonely cheerleader for a destructive fishing method being rejected by all its local competitors and by tuna brands around the world,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s a shameful waste with up to 10 times more bycatch compared to more sustainable methods like pole and line fishing.”(3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sealord says purse seiners using FADs “increases efficiency” (4) but recently signed a pledge with WWF (5) to try and reduce bycatch levels in its supply chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Sealord’s acknowledgement that bycatch levels need to be reduced is a small step in the right direction but its support of this wasteful fishing practice makes a joke of its sustainability claims.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last month Woolworths Limited, the parent company to New Zealand's Countdown supermarket chain announced it was shifting its own brands away from FAD-caught tuna. It said the move “will significantly reduce the bycatch of sharks, dolphins and juvenile tuna in the supply chain”. (6) Woolworths says its Select range at Countdown will change to pole and line caught tuna by the end of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand shoppers already have more sustainable options. Pams, the own brand for Foodstuffs-owned supermarkets, has changed most of its range to FAD-free and pole and line caught tuna. Ceres, a much smaller player, introduced the Fish 4 Ever range of pole and line caught tuna more than a year ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other big brands sold in New Zealand are John West and Greenseas, Both are Australian-based and have recently made similar commitments to stop selling FAD-caught tuna on both sides of the Tasman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Unlike Sealord, these companies are clearly committed to sustainable fishing methods which are essential to protecting our oceans for the next generations,” says Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 1 June 2011 – Tuna stocks and other ocean life are being threatened by the fishing methods used to fill Sealord tuna cans, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning Greenpeace launched a public campaign in downtown Auckland urging Sealord to clean up its act and become a market leader in sustainability for canned tuna sold in New Zealand. A video released on the Greenpeace website reveals the contents of future Sealord tuna cans if the company does not change its tuna.(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sealord must stop buying tuna for its canned products from companies using fishing  methods which kill endangered sharks, turtles, juvenile tuna and other ocean species,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealord, and other New Zealand brands of canned tuna, buy tuna which is caught using purse seine nets combined with fish aggregation devices (FADs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“FADs are like marine death traps as they attract all sorts of ocean life, not just tuna, making the bycatch of purse seine fisheries up to 10 times higher than other more sustainable methods.(2) This is threatening tuna stocks in the Pacific and the health of the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sealord promote themselves as ‘the seafood experts’ but there’s nothing smart about catching everything in the ocean then throwing back what you don’t want, injured, dead or dying. That’s exploitation, not expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Sealord announced it was updating its branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sealord needs to change more than just its logo. We’re urging Sealord to change its tuna and move to more sustainable fishing methods, ending its trade in tuna caught by purse seines with fish aggregation devices. Without this commitment Sealord is not serious about sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last month more than 7500 concerned consumers have emailed New Zealand’s five main canned tuna brands asking them to ‘change your tuna’. Pams, the brand owned by supermarket chain Foodstuffs, has indicated that it is starting to take steps to offer consumers a sustainable option by introducing a pole and line caught range of canned tuna by the end of the year. It has also said it was “actively investigating” alternative options to FAD-caught tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an encouraging step in the right direction and follows what’s happening in overseas markets,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but one of the UK’s major canned tuna brands have announced they will stop using tuna caught by purse seiners using FADs.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sealord and the other New Zealand brands must do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently the Pacific had the world's last healthy tuna fisheries. These are now under threat as industrial fishing fleets, which have exhausted tuna stocks in other oceans, are concentrating their efforts in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Pacific tuna stocks are in decline. Bigeye and yellowfin are the most at risk. Scientists have advised that fishing needs to be cut by up to 50 per cent to allow bigeye tuna to recover.(4) Skipjack, the most common species used in canned products, is also under pressure.(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning globally to create a more sustainable and equitable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans - necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland Tuesday May 31 2011: Greenpeace NZ Web Manager Nick Young reports that the stand off with the Danish navy is currently “pretty tense”, but that Greenpeace’s activists are still preventing the deep sea oil rig the Leiv Eiriksson from starting to drill.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, global carbon emissions have reached the highest levels ever despite the economic downturn, according to figures from the International Energy Agency reported this week in the Guardian newspaper. The surge has raised concerns that the target of avoiding a dangerous 2C rise in global temperatures is "almost out of reach”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nick Young is on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;, one of the two Greenpeace vessels taking part in the action, because the New Zealand Government, like Denmark’s, is also opening up the deep waters under its jurisdiction to exploitation by the deep sea oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young says the rig is currently shrouded in fog, but that he can see the Danish warship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Arctic oil rush is only underway because the ice cap is rapidly retreating due to climate change. This really should be the moment when we decide to shift course. We now know with some certainty that if we don’t, we face a grave and uncertain future. If we choose to grasp the potential of new clean technologies we could curb some of the worst impacts of the warming whilst creating new jobs and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The global surge in climate pollution means the carbon tipping point is very nearly upon us. The oil rig I am looking at now and that our activists are preventing from drilling represents the crazy thinking that is bringing us to the brink of runaway climate change. Instead of seeing a warming Arctic as an ominous warning they treat it as an invitation to drill for more climate-changing fossil fuels, threatening the Arctic environment in the process,” Young says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; At 3am local time yesterday a team of expert climbers in inflatable speedboats climbed the 53,000 tonne self propelled semi submersible rig the Leiv Eiriksson. They avoided a Danish warship that had been shadowing the Greenpeace team for days, having been sent to keep the protesters off the rig. The climbers set up camp a few metres from the huge drill-bit that Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy hopes will strike oil in the coming weeks. If Greenpeace can continue to delay drilling for just a short time, Cairn could struggle to meet a tight deadline to complete the exploration before winter ice closes in, forcing it to abandon the search for another year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Leiv Eiriksson  has now reached its drill site. The Danish warship this morning declared a 500m exclusion zone around the rig as the stand-off continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Young, on board the &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;, is available for live satphone interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aerial pictures (video and stills) of the standoff will soon be available from Greenpeace’s FTP sever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For help with all of the above, contact Jay Harkness, Greenpeace NZ media and Communications, on 021 495 216.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 15/6/11: Barbie, the most famous toy in the world, is involved in rainforest destruction, a Greenpeace International investigation has revealed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The doll’s packaging comes from the rainforests of Indonesia, home to endangered species like the Sumatran tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists, dressed in tuxedos to mimic Barbie’s boyfriend Ken, last week scaled Mattel’s Los Angeles HQ with a giant banner that read: “Barbie: It’s Over. I Don’t Date Girls That Are Into Deforestation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity in Los Angeles marked the start of a worldwide Greenpeace campaign to end toy companies’ involvement in deforestation in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators used forensic testing to reveal that Barbie’s packaging comes from Indonesia’s rainforests. A combination of ‘in country’ investigation, mapping data, and work in tracing company certificates was used, to show that Mattel, the makers of Barbie, are using packaging produced by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a company which has been exposed a number of times for its involvement in the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests to make throw-away packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred and eighty new Barbies are sold every minute around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand is calling on New Zealanders to join the campaign to get Mattel to drop APP from its supply chain, by writing to the company’s CEO. Details on how to do that are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Barbie is trashing rainforests which is then pushing critically-endangered wildlife, like tigers, towards extinction, says Nathan Argent, Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mattel, which makes Barbie, must stop wrapping the world’s most famous toy in rainforest destruction, supplied by APP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“APP is bad news for Indonesia’s forests. It treats Indonesia as nothing more than a vast disposable asset, grabbing rainforests that are vital to forest communities. Mattel must stop buying packaging from APP and instead support responsible Indonesian producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesia has one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of rainforests are being cleared every year. This loss not only threatens the survival of some of the world’s rarest animals, but is also a major contributor to climate change,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, June 24 2011: A new report by Greenpeace International shows that since the 1990s, installations of wind and solar grew faster than any other power plant technology [1]. Together with the rest of the global expansion of sources of renewable energy, these new sources would provide enough energy to supply New Zealand 45 times over.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace report, &lt;em&gt;The Silent Energy Revolution: 20 Years in the Making&lt;/em&gt;, also highlights how renewable energy power plants accounted for more than a quarter (26%) of all new power plants added to the worldwide electricity grid over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With renewable energy now the world’s fastest growing source of power plant installations, our Government has a simple, clear choice,” says Greenpeace NZ Climate Change Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a renewable energy powerhouse, with a wealth of renewable energy know-how, the Government can choose to place our home grown talent at the heart of this global, clean energy revolution [2], or it can shackle our economy to the dirty fossil fuels of yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it chooses the clean energy route, our world class ingenuity could not only be the building blocks of a cleaner, more prosperous economy here at home, it could be part of the global solution to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The starting gun of the clean energy race has been fired, and the Government must act now to ensure New Zealand’s clean energy pioneers get out of the blocks or risk being left behind as spectators,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silent Energy Revolution report shows that between 2000 and 2010, the construction of new coal plants went into decline in every country except China. However, not only has China phased out some of its dirtiest coal plants over the last five years, it has doubled its capacity in the domestic wind market every year since 2003 and since 2009 has invested more money in the renewables industry, than in coal.&lt;/p&gt;

	Ōpōtiki, 5 April 2011: The first flotilla boat opposing deep sea oil drilling S/V Infinity encountered the seismic testing ship Orient Explorer in the Raukumara Basin at around 16:45 yesterday, a little over 24 hours since the deep sea oil exploration vessel left Tauranga. 
Infinity made radio contact with the ship and has been following and
observing it since then.

They have chosen to ignore us.  Petrobras’ history of accidents continues with the latest mishap in the Gulf of Mexico on their deep sea rig the Chinook reported today (1). We have no confidence in this company or the government to not harm what is&lt;br&gt;invaluable to us. We do not want any oil exploration or drilling in our waters.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson on board the flotilla vessel Infinity radioed the captain of the MV Orient Explorer and demanded they cease all operations and leave the area immediately. The Captain acknowledged the call and continued with seismic testing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla crew are currently following and observing operations. Their presence of protest and bearing witness is to send a clear message to the deep sea oil industry and the New Zealand Government. Calling from the flotilla boat Vanessa Atkinson said, “We are here to make absolutely sure that the deep sea oil industry knows that they are not welcome here.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Deep sea oil is at the extreme end of the fossil fuel industry. It is totally reckless for the Government to have invited this industry into our waters – in so doing they risk an oil disaster that could devastate our coastline and economy,” said Steve Abel, Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner stationed in Opotiki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We need Government leadership that sets a path away from fossil fuel dependence and into clean economy”, Abel said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seismic testing vessel Orient Explorer flagged to Panama (82 meters) is accompanied by a smaller support vessel the NZ flagged Ocean Pioneer (32.7 meters).  The pictures accompanying this release are taken from a boat in the Stop Deep Sea Oil flotilla Infinity and depict the Ocean Pioneer in the foreground and the Ocean Explorer (the seismic testing vessel) in the distance.

	Shell’s multi-billion dollar Arctic investment lies in tatters today, and so does the company’s reputation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Responding to today’s news that oil giant Shell have ditched plans to drill in the Arctic this year, Bunny McDiarmid, executive director of Greenpeace, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shell’s multi-billion dollar Arctic investment lies in tatters today, and so does the company’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They massively underestimated the challenges posed by drilling off Alaska, and pushed on regardless, determined to spark a new Arctic oil rush. The huge global movement that sprang up to oppose them started right here in New Zealand, when a small group of volunteers &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;boarded a Shell-contracted drilling ship in Taranaki, to try and stop it heading for the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shell have dropped plans to drill this year, but when they try to head to the Arctic again, the millions of people who have backed the campaign to make this beautiful and special place off-limits for oil drilling will be waiting for them.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 8/7/11: Rail jobs will be an important part of the transition to a clean economy – and a clean economy is something the Government must start the move toward now, says Greenpeace New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace New Zealand representative will be speaking at tomorrow’s rally in Dunedin to save rail workers’ jobs at two of Kiwirail’s workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiwirail wants to cut 70 jobs from its Dunedin and Lower Hutt workshops combined, after having given a contract to build rail wagons to an overseas supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is pleased to be a part of this campaign,” says Greenpeace’s Michael Tritt, “because the workers who will help deliver a modern rail system are critical to building a clean economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rail is efficient, it’s good for our energy security, and it means fewer greenhouse gas emissions, at a time when we’re dangerously close to the point of triggering a state of runaway climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries around the world are now investing heavily in rail because of this. Yet New Zealand is lagging far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kiwirail is a state-owned enterprise. As such, Transport Minister Stephen Joyce, despite what he says, could intervene to keep these ‘green collar’ jobs in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This, along with not supporting projects such as Auckland’s underground rail loop, his obsession with building yet more roads, and the Government’s handouts for the deep water oil industry, are all proof that our leaders still have no idea of the value in becoming a clean economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pure Advantage group, made up of some of New Zealand’s best business people, launched their campaign last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re telling us that the rest of the world, much of which does understand the enormous potential in clean economics, is getting away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we are to prosper in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, then we must heed such messages, now,” Tritt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally begins at 1pm, in the Octagon, Dunedin, tomorrow (Saturday July 9).&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 27 July 2011 – An announcement yesterday that means all the main tuna brands in the UK are shifting to greener fishing methods has set a sustainability benchmark that New Zealand must follow says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John West confirmed it was joining the other major UK tuna industry players which have already promised to drop an indiscriminate fishing method which kills endangered sharks, juvenile tuna, turtles and other ocean species.(1) This method combines fish aggregation devices (FADs) to lure in fish and purse seine nets which scoop up everything in the area..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand tuna brands must also stop getting their tuna from companies using this shameful and wasteful practice,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a campaign by Greenpeace calling on New Zealand tuna brands to “change their tuna” Foodstuffs announced last month it will change most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free by the end of the year.(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disappointingly Sealord, New Zealand’s largest tuna brand, is ignoring evidence of the damage caused by indiscriminate fishing and is showing no signs of cleaning up its act and following what’s happening in the UK or here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to statistics, supported and circulated by Sealord, bycatch of other species is five to 10 times more when purse seiners use FADs. This method also increases and the amount of juvenile and undersized tunas being caught to 15-20 per cent of the catch,” says Thomas.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of New Zealand’s canned tuna comes from the Pacific Ocean. All Pacific tuna stocks are in decline, with bigeye and yellowfin the most at risk. Scientists have advised that fishing needs to be cut by up to 50 per cent to allow bigeye tuna to recover.(4) Skipjack, the most common species used in canned products, is also under pressure.(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning globally for fishing industry reform and for a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans, necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 9th November 2011: Actor Lucy Lawless and climate scientist Jim Salinger today added their names to a Greenpeace petition calling for a shift to clean sources of energy. The number of people signing the petition has surged since the Rena disaster, and the total is now over 100,000.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The petition also calls for a stop to the Government’s plans for deep sea oil drilling off New Zealand’s coasts, and for a halt to plans to expand the coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d urge anyone who wants to protect our coasts from an even worse oil spill than that which we saw in Tauranga, to sign this petition,” said Lawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued: “By doing so, they’ll also be doing something positive about the climate crisis that this planet is facing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate scientist Jim Salinger said: "Opening up the final, extreme frontiers of the oil industry, whether they are in New Zealand or the Arctic, is only going to make global warming worse now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Decisions we make today will determine the severity of climate change that our children and grandchildren will have to deal with. I urge all New Zealanders who care about the future of humanity on this planet to sign this petition," said Salinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Abel, Greenpeace NZ climate Change Campaigner, said: “People simply aren’t buying John Key’s line that the Rena spill has no relation to the risks of deep sea oil drilling.  What the Rena demonstrated was that even a small oil spill, in shallow waters near one of New Zealand’s biggest ports, can’t be controlled, and will have devastating impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yet the Rena spill was not even 0.1 per cent the size of the Deepwater Horizon deep sea oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year,” Abel said (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP alone has set aside more than US $40 billion to cover its share of the cost of the disaster. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given that international oil giants like Shell, Andarko and Petrobras are planning to drill in New Zealand waters at depths even greater than the 1500 metres the Deepwater Horizon was operating in, the risk of a catastrophic spill happening here is very real,” Abel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Imagine waiting helplessly for hundreds or thousands of times more oil than that which came from the Rena to wash ashore. We must never expose ourselves to that sort of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel concluded: “The economic impact of deep sea oil drilling on New   Zealand’s clean green reputation needs to be properly evaluated.  To understand the extent of the risks posed by deep sea oil drilling, the Government needs to extrapolate the economic, ecological and cultural impacts of Rena. But as long as they maintain that there is no relation between the two, then they are burying their heads in the sand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition exists in hard copy form, and online, at: http://greenpe.ac/nodeepseaoil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)   While the Rena has so far spilt 350 tonnes – a significant amount that will have long-lasting, serious impacts – BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico last year spilt 650,000 tonnes of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 19 October 2011 - Last week’s announcement that a second tuna brand sold in New Zealand will be shifting to ‘greener’ tuna is good news for the Pacific, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenseas, owned by Heinz in Australia, has committed to phase out by 2015 tuna caught using a method which kills threatened sharks, turtles, juvenile tuna and other ocean species (1). The method combines purse seine nets set around fish aggregation devices (FADs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, it is estimated the bycatch from this method of catching tuna may be as high as 182,500 tonnes per year (2) – the equivalent of nearly one billion cans (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year local retailer Foodstuffs announced most of its Pams brand tuna would be sourced from pole and line or FAD-free fisheries by the end of the 2011 (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner Karli Thomas welcomed the Greenseas news and urged other tuna brands to follow. Thomas is currently aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza which is on a three-month expedition (5) in the Pacific focusing attention directly on the region that supplies more than half the world’s tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is another step towards protecting the Pacific from destructive tuna fishing which is threatening tuna stocks and the region's food security and economic prosperity,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The canned tuna revolution that saw all the major UK brands commit to source more sustainably caught tuna is catching on here. We'll be keeping the pressure up until we see New Zealand's other main tuna brand, Sealord, end its use of tuna caught by indiscriminate fishing methods.” Sealord has so far refused to make a change in its practice of using tuna caught by purse seiners around FADs, although documents distributed by the company reveal that the bycatch of other ocean life is 5-10 times higher when FADs are used than when purse seiners fish on free-swimming schools of tuna. Additionally, the catch of juvenile and under-sized tunas around FADs is high, between 15-20% of the total haul (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of New Zealand’s canned tuna comes from the Pacific which, until recently, had the world's last healthy tuna fisheries. These are now under threat as industrial fishing fleets, which have exhausted tuna stocks in other oceans, are concentrating their efforts in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are close to 6000 industrial tuna vessels licensed to fish in the Western and Central Pacific region. In 2009 those vessels caught almost 2.5 million tonnes of tuna – around 60 per cent of the world’s tuna supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Good news for tuna and other ocean creatures! A second major canned tuna brand has announced it will be phasing out tuna caught using a fishing method which kills large quantities of other marine life. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/oceans/2011/greenseas.jpg" alt="Greenseas" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indiscriminate method involves purse seine nets being set around fish aggregation devices (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_ZXYREJo8"&gt;FADs&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FADs are like a large floating lure. In addition to the tuna, they also attract other ocean life –such as threatened sharks, baby tuna and even the occasional turtle – which, along with the tuna, are then scooped up in the huge purse seine nets. The unwanted species, known as bycatch, are usually thrown back injured, dead or dying. FADs increase the bycatch of purse seine fisheries up to &lt;a href="http://iss-foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/05/FAD-document.pdf"&gt;10 times more&lt;/a&gt; than other more sustainable methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in April, we started asking New Zealand’s five main tuna brands to stop using tuna caught this way and to change to more sustainably caught tuna. Since then 16,055 messages have been sent to tuna companies asking them to switch to more sustainably caught tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Greenseas (which is based in Australia but sells tuna in NZ) &lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/greenseas-to-drop-harmful-tuna-fishing/story-e6frf7jx-1226165861971"&gt;committed to shift to ‘greener’ tuna&lt;/a&gt; by phasing out FAD-caught tuna over the next three years.  This makes it the second brand to respond to our ‘change your tuna’ campaign. Earlier in the year local retailer Foodstuffs announced – on world oceans day, no less – that most of its Pams brand tuna would be sourced from pole and line or &lt;a href="http://www.foodstuffs.co.nz/media-centre/news--media/foodstuffs-hooks-sustainable-tuna-for-world-ocean-day"&gt;FAD-free fisheries by the end of this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves Sealord, New Zealand’s largest canned tuna brand, dragging their heels along with Australian brand John West and the own brands of Countdown and Woolworth supermarkets. These companies are financially supporting the senseless waste of ocean life by buying tuna from fleets that set nets around fish aggregation devices – killing much more than just tuna in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealord, which makes out it is big on sustainability and uses the slogan ‘Seafood Experts’, should have been the leader and the first to change. It may have missed that boat, but it’s not too late to change – Foodstuffs, Greenseas and a host of overseas tuna brands have already paved the way and shown its possible to source tuna from cleaner fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can encourage Sealord to join the movement to sustainably caught tuna by sending the company an &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Message-to-Sealord/"&gt;email now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, Monday 17th October, 2011. This morning Greenpeace activists held a legal protest outside Port Taranaki against a ship that is due to depart imminently to start exploring for deep sea oil – the new frontier of oil development off New Zealand’s shores.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;There was a heavy police presence at the port overnight and this morning – to protect the controversial ship, Polarcus Alima, which arrived in Taranaki this morning. It is due to leave shortly to start exploring for oil off Raglan at depths of up to 1600 metres, on behalf of US oil giant Anadarko (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the ship’s survey is successful then the drilling of wildcat oil wells off Raglan could begin as early as next year (2).  Anadarko were part owners of the 1500 metre deep well the Deepwater Horizon was drawing oil from, which leaked 780 million litres of oil into the Gulf of Mexico last year over a three month period. A major reason it took so long to control the leak was the extreme depths the oil companies were operating in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ship will later go on to prospect in deep water areas off Stewart Island, in a permit area due to be taken over by Shell Oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner Simon Boxer said, “Greenpeace are here conducting a legal peaceful protest to expose the fact that even as oil continues to seep from the wreck of Rena, the Government is pushing ahead with the next phase of their controversial deep sea oil drilling plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government’s blinkered obsession with deep water oil drilling has to stop now.  It’s time for it to stop spending millions on trying to entice the deep sea oil industry to New Zealand and telling us that to drill ever deeper is the only future for this country. This is simply not true; study after study tells us that leveraging New Zealand’s clean reputation is the key to our economic future.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt Maunganui-based surfer Dominico Zapata, who was part of the protest said, “I’ve spent the week clearing oil off the beaches of Tauranga and witnessing the devastation on Motiti Island. I’m here today to say never again.  If we can’t control the spill from Rena, then we have no chance of containing a deep sea oil drilling disaster.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another protestor, Raglan resident Phil McCabe, said, “Two years ago I stood up to see off plans to open our best conservation land for mining and today I’m here to take a stand against deep sea oil drilling. Rena showed us that our oceans and our coastlines are too valuable to gamble for oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued, “It chills me to imagine the impact of a blowout from one of the Government’s planned deep water oil rigs – then we would be looking at millions of barrels of oil washing up on our shores, not hundreds.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been dealing with a surge of public interest following the Rena spill. Thousands of New Zealanders signed Greenpeace’s ‘No New Oil’ petition over the last week, with the total number of signatories now standing at over 92,000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A team of volunteers organised by Greenpeace NZ have been working since Saturday to help clean toxic fuel oil off beaches in the Bay of Plenty. Today they are working to clean up Matakana Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Greenpeace scientist with experience of assessing the impacts of both the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf and spills in the Amazon has also been brought to the Bay of Plenty to provide expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Polarcus Alima is due to be in New Zealand waters for the next four to five months conducting deepwater 3D surveys.

	Auckland October 31 2011: Auckland planners must account for the realities of the 21st century, rather than clinging to the car-based dreams of the 1950s, if the city is to prosper, and improve its liveability, says Greenpeace New Zealand in a submission to be made today on Auckland’s Draft Plan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Auckland biggest problem right now is the bad choices being made by Transport Minister Steven Joyce,” says Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aucklanders pay their taxes and road user charges, which go into a funding pool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;controlled by Wellington. Politicians like Mr Joyce then ignore Aucklanders’ preference for public transport improvements like the CBD loop, instead prioritising billions of dollars of largely unnecessary pet roading projects,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government is spending millions of taxpayers’ dollars trying to attract the international oil industry to drill dangerous deep water wells off New Zealand. Meanwhile the Government is telling Aucklanders that it won’t pay for the public transport system we need for a sustainable post-oil economy,” Abel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Central Government funded most of the infrastructure needed for the Rugby World Cup itself. So why not do the same for the CBD loop? The economic, transport and social advantages for the region, and so the county, would be enormous,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ’s submission advocates the scrapping of the Puhoi-Wellsford ‘Holiday Highway,’ in favour of safety improvements to the existing road, which Greenpeace also called for in January this year, in a submission to the NZTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend the Labour Party became the latest to call for the dumping of the ‘Holiday Highway.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s nice to see that, finally, the political parties are starting to see the ‘Holiday Highway’ for what it is – an economically unjustifiable project that would come at the expense of what would be huge leap forward for public transport in Auckland,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Fish Aggregation Devices are the scourge of the seas, floating death traps for fish, sharks, rays and turtles. But what is a FAD, and why are they used? 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of canned tuna worldwide is caught using purse seine nets with fish aggregation devices. A FAD can be any floating object – fisherman have been using FADs made of branches, palm fronds and logs for centuries.[1] Here in the Pacific Ocean we have seen a barrel drum, large missile-like objects and a haphazard collection of junk as well as more sophisticated FADs consisting of netted buoys and a radio beacon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experts are still trying to understand why these floating devices attract so much marine life[2] – theories include “visual stimulus in an optical void”[3], a point of reference, or an attraction to the marine matter that attaches to floating objects.  &lt;strong&gt;What is certain is that they work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fishermen use them as a surefire way to catch a school of fish – usually skipjack tuna, but problems abound because when purse seine nets are set around FADs, everything underneath is caught and usually ends up dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, FADs attract baby tuna, often from at-risk species like bigeye and yellowfin. Fishing juveniles obviously damages the reproductive process, preventing fish from replenishing their stocks. In fact, according to the University of Hawaii’s pelagic fishing programme, FADs fished by purse seine nets are a major contributor toward yellowfin and bigeye tuna stocks being pushed toward depletion [4]. Both of these species are overfished and have been listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s red list as vulnerable and near-threatened respectively. At least 15 to 20 % of a FAD catch is expected to be juvenile bigeye and yellowfin.[5]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, FADs often trail netting which seems to add to their attractiveness to tuna, and can snag turtles, sharks, and other creatures, causing injury and death. [6] From the kings of the marine food chain - sharks - to turtles, manta rays, mahi mahi, and many other marine species, much more than just tuna is hauled up in the purse seine net as well, often dying in the process. These animals are euphemistically called ‘bycatch’ and FAD purse seine fishing can incur ten times the amount of other species killed as non-FAD fishing.[7]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a disturbing look at some undercover footage of bycatch on board a tuna boat watch this film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="440" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6JlKwoUtMk4" width="608"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Globally it is estimated that FAD associated bycatch may now be as high as 182,500 tonnes annually.[8] This global bycatch would fill the equivalent of nearly 1 billion tins of tuna every year.[9]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research presented to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Science Committee in 2009 showed that the use of FADs led to significant bycatch of bigeye and yellowfin, turtles, marlin, barracuda, whale sharks, silky sharks, olive ridley turtles and juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna.[10]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular, more than 75% of the oceanic pelagic shark and ray species are classified as threatened or near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whalesharks, IUCN red listed globally as vulnerable, are also caught incidentally in purse seine nets,[11] and in fact are sometimes used as living FADs by purse seine vessels. This is something Greenpeace is campaigning on to ban the intentional setting on whalesharks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Longlining, gillnet and trawl fisheries are the main cause of turtle deaths, but purse seines using FADs are also responsible for the deaths of turtles.[12]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combine the ruthless efficiency of FADs with the more widespread problem of overfishing - larger boats with greater capacity chasing fewer and fewer fish – and you begin to see the problem for remaining tuna stocks. Years of bad management and overfishing has left tuna stocks in crisis. The majority of tuna stocks are in decline and appear set to continue on this downward slide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 2006, of the 23 commercially exploitable tuna stocks identified: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• At least nine were classified by tuna management bodies as fully fished&lt;br&gt;• A further four were classified as overexploited or depleted&lt;br&gt;• Three were classified as critically endangered&lt;br&gt;• Three were endangered, AND&lt;br&gt;• Three were vulnerable to extinction.[13]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without monitoring and effective management, even stocks of the healthiest remaining species, like skipjack, could suffer.[14][15][16][17] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the real picture could be a lot worse than the formal stock assessment. Data is notoriously hard to gather and formalize across all tuna markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the bright side, consumers, industry leaders and retailers are demanding a move away from FADs and towards more sustainable ways of fishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, every major tuna brand in the United Kingdom committed to abandoning FADs, and leaders in the fishing industry are committing parts of their fleets to free school, or non FAD fishing to meet this growing consumer demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pole and lines fisheries, in which each tuna are caught individually, reduce bycatch to almost zero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other things that can be done. Retailers and tuna brands should endorse the creation of a global network of large scale marine reserves and should publicly support the call for the Pacific Commons to be off limits to fishing and ensure they are not selling any canned tuna caught in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The Earth has a new champion. In Bremerhaven, Germany, we’ve held the naming ceremony for the world’s first purpose-built, crowd-bought, eco-sleek sailing vessel, the new Rainbow Warrior.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the 100,000 donors who bought a bolt, an action boat, an anchor, a chart, a soap dish, a piece of her sail or the whole of her wheelhouse, thank you and obrigado. If you’re one of our 3 million regular annual donors, merci bien and Xie Xie! If you’re one of our 17 million email or mobile subscribers, Facebook fans or Twitter followers, gracias and shukran.  If you’re one of our 14,000 volunteers, danke schön and kinanâskomitinawaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said the Earth needed a new warrior, and each of you answered that call: today we smash a bottle of champagne across the bow, and launch the world’s first ship built from the keel up to win the battle for the future of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two A-frame masts exclaim that this is no ordinary sailing ship: it is a sleek, efficient eco-vessel, every detail crafted with sustainability in mind, from the silicon-based paint on her hull to the FSC wood of her cabins, to the onboard recycling systems and biological sewage treatment. The new Rainbow Warrior will primarily be powered and propelled by the sun and wind , with the option in unsuitable weather to switch to efficient diesel-electric power. The revolutionary mast design allows her to carry more sail, and makes room for the radio masts, antennas, and domes that provide internet and satellite communications -- allowing us to broadcast video from remote locations and tweet from any ocean. She boasts a video editing suite, a conference room, a campaign office, two fast action boats, webcams fore and aft and a helicopter hanger and helideck. She can accommodate up to 30 people.&lt;/p&gt;

            Melina Laboucan-Massimo is from the Cree First Nation from Northern Alberta, Canada. She is the Godmother of the ship.
The Rainbow Warrior prophecy (that the ship is named after) comes from Indigenous nations in North American, like the Cree.

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ship to bear her name was a rusting fishing trawler scraped and sanded down by hand and painted with a dove and rainbow. She made history saving whales, stopping radioactive waste dumping, and sailing straight into the forbidden zone around nuclear weapons tests from the Pacific to the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her voyage into history was cut short by two limpet mines in 1985, when frightened politicians in Paris ordered French agents to sink the ship in New Zealand, believing this would stop our protests against nuclear weapons tests. One crewmember was murdered in the attack – photographer Fernando Pereira. It was a massive miscalculation, catalyzing opposition throughout the Pacific, strengthening Greenpeace, and hardening our resolve to rebuild and return. A supporter in Auckland coined the phrase that became a motto of opposition: “You Can’t Sink a Rainbow.”  When we returned to Moruroa in a refurbished sister ship, the legacy of the Rainbow Warrior as a parable of persistence was sealed. Today the Rainbow Warrior II is doing relief work in India as a hospital ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a purpose-built campaigning ship, the new Warrior will be a voice for our oceans, our forests, our climate, and our future. Built to last for at least 50 years, she is a promise to you, our supporters, to never give in, never give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International Executive Director, said at the ceremony: “The new Rainbow Warrior is the perfect ship with which navigate the perfect storm of ecological, economic and democratic crises lashing our world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Carrying an international crew, the Rainbow Warrior will confront environmental criminals across the world, she will investigate and expose destructive activities, but perhaps most of all will provide a beacon of hope and an inspiration to action wherever she goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve not yet been a part of the journey of building the Rainbow Warrior, please come onboard and be part of her voyage. The world needs another warrior: you.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland July 7 2011: Greenpeace is welcoming the launch of the Pure Advantage group’s campaign to have New Zealand capitalise on its potential to develop a strong, clean economy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pure Advantage is also calling on the country’s clean green image to be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure Advantage is made up of some of New Zealand’s most successful businesspeople, including the founder of The Warehouse, Sir Stephan Tindall, Phillip Mills, of the Les Mills gym franchise, and Rob Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s launch shows that our best entrepreneurs see the potential of the clean economy, and the dangers in not protecting this country’s competitive edge – its clean, green image,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will all do well if we act on what Pure Advantage is telling us,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rest of the world, much of which is aware of the gains to be made from transitioning to a clean economy, is getting away on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The amount of investment overseas in clean energies and technologies, for example, is astonishing. South Korea alone will have spent US$85 billion on cleantech projects between 2009 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is vital that New Zealand also starts making the transition, to combat climate change, but also to give ourselves the best chances of success in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today expressed extreme concern about the ongoing oil spill from the stricken vessel Rena. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Steve Abel, Greenpeace Campaigner said, “This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea. Even a slow, and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand’s response capability to its limits”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is also potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also cautioned against any further use of toxic chemicals to disperse the spill. Abel explained, “The fact is dispersants don’t clean up a spill. They only put it out of sight and often add to the harm by increasing the toxic load that wildlife are exposed to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded, "The focus right now has to be on stopping the ship releasing its remaining oil and minimizing the impact of the existing 5km slick on wildlife and coastlines”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we are through this crisis period, serious questions need to be asked about the government's preparedness and ability to handle oil spills even of this relatively small scale”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace opposes the government’s plans for deep sea oil development off New Zealand’s coast due to the risk of blow outs and spills such as occurred in the US Gulf of Mexico in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has offered Maritime NZ the support of their inflatable boats, experienced drivers and volunteers to assist in the oil clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 11 November 2011: A French court today convicted the French state electricity company, Electricité de France SA (EDF), on charges of spying on Greenpeace in France. The company was fined €1.5 million, and ordered to pay €500,000 in damages to Greenpeace for non-material losses.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;EDF &lt;a title="www.guardian.co.uk/..." href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/10/edf-spying-greenpeace" target="_blank"&gt;was charged with complicity in concealing stolen documents&lt;/a&gt;, and complicity with an operation to break into a computer network. In 2006, EDF hired a hacker and a private investigator in a ‘cloak-and-dagger’ undercover effort to spy on Greenpeace France. The spying operation monitored Greenpeace while it challenged plans by the UK government to work with EDF to expand its nuclear operations. The hacking allowed the theft of more than 1,400 documents from the computer of Greenpeace France’s Programme Director.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the charges against EDF, two EDF nuclear safety officials and two staff from Kargus Consulting, the company EDF hired to spy on its behalf, were convicted on charges related to spying. All four were jailed, and three were also fined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The convictions follows revelations earlier this week that the New Zealand Police refused an OIA request by the Taranaki Daily News for details of how the department knew in advance about a peaceful protest by Greenpeace against the arrival of the deep sea oil exploration vessel Polarcus Alima at Port Taranaki on October 17.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace activists were intercepted in the early hours of the 17th by a police roadblock, as they drove towards New Plymouth. A police launch, which is reportedly not normally stationed at the Port, was also on hand to prevent activists entering the harbour. However peaceful protests both outside the port, and by surfers on the water, successfully went ahead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Polarcus Alima is currently prospecting for oil in Deepwater Taranaki on behalf oil giant Anardarko, and will later travel to the Great South Basin to prospect on behalf of Shell Oil. If the surveys are successful, oil drilling at depths of up to thousands of metres could start as soon as late 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We would not like to think that our police force in New Zealand has been tasked with doing what EDF were doing in France – spying on the public to protect the interests of big corporations,” says Greenpeace NZ’s Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Democracy is built upon the right to peaceful protest. Without it we wouldn’t have votes for women and they would still be testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific. Treating Greenpeace as if we are a threat to the common good is, at best, a waste of public resources,” McDiarmid says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been the subject of both company and state-sponsored spying in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2008, the state-owned company Solid Energy admitted to paying spies to monitor people who were campaigning to prevent an open-cast coal mine being dug in the West Coast’s Happy Valley. Greenpeace New Zealand staff and volunteers were amongst those the SOE sought information on. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to that episode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 1980s a French Government agent, known as Christine Cabon, posed as a volunteer in order to spy on Greenpeace as they prepared to protest against French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. The information she gathered was used by the French secret service to prepare for the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985, in which Greenpeace crew member Fernando Pereira was killed. Following worldwide protests against the attack on the Rainbow Warrior the French Government cancelled their nuclear weapons testing programme in the Pacific and later signed an international treaty banning nuclear weapons testing.&lt;/p&gt;

	Guidelines for writing an AWESOME press release
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: These guidelines are written to support you, the more you follow them the better your press release will be. With that in mind, writing isn’t everyone’s strong point and can be quite daunting, especially the first time you write one. That’s why we are here to help you, please don’t hesitate to ask or send through your draft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 quick tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Accurate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Timely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get straight to the point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first paragraph should contain the punch. It should make the reporter or the editor want to read on. Write it like you’d tell a friend the crux of an interesting story over a beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quote only up to  two  people in one release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are quoting someone, make sure to introduce who they are before going into their quote. The reader shouldn’t have to get to the end of a quote to find out who actually said it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intersperse quotes between paragraphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always end with a conclusion of what you want to happen or one that leaves the reader with an interesting afterthought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always check grammar and spelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have at least one other person proofread or comment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nitty gritty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips before you start:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use left-hand justification (all paragraphs begin flush with the left-hand margin, no indents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify clearly whether the news release is "For immediate release" or "Embargoed for release until &amp;lt;date, time, time zone)&amp;gt;" on the top line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dateline &lt;/strong&gt;"location, day-month-year" in bold text, i.e. Kaikohe, 1 January 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title &lt;/strong&gt;should be one short and punchy line, written lower case except for proper names, and should be written in an active not passive voice. Titles should be considerably less than 140 characters in length to allow for Tweeting with the appropriate header (i.e. News release: Napier community takes on the Council)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First paragraph&lt;/strong&gt; should present the entire story, by answering the five W’s: who, what, when, where, why. It should be no more than two sentences in 26 words or less. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second and third paragraphs should address context/explanation and provide a quote by a spokesperson, including their name and short job title (this is probably you but write it in third person)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequent paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt; provide additional information that may include a quote from the spokesperson or a third-party validator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The release ends with “- ENDS -“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More helpful tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Note to editors:” may follow for any links to publications, photos or video&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid jargon or figures of speech that may not be correctly interpreted internationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not exaggerate to make a point, as it suggests your core argument is weak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say what needs to be said only once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quote only up to two people in one release and intersperse quotes between the paragraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create strong, compelling quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an affirmative and active tense using clear and simple language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After introducing speaker, attribute quotes to them using just their last name with no prefix title, followed with an active “says” (as opposed to “said”). Eg, “QUOTE,” Smith says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure each paragraph is no more than three sentences long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute a quote to a named individual and include a short job title &lt;/li&gt;

	Greenpeace's work is based on a number of key principles. They are reflected in all our campaigns, and they guide whatever we do, wherever we do it. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal responsibility and Nonviolence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take personal responsibility for our actions, and we are committed to nonviolence. These principles are inspired by the Quaker concept of 'bearing witness', which is about taking action based on conscience – personal action based on personal responsibility. We are accountable for our actions, and everyone on a Greenpeace action is trained in &lt;a title="non-violent direct action" href="/new-zealand/en/about/Our-core-values1/taking-action/"&gt;nonviolent direct action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ensure our financial independence from political or commercial interests. We do not accept money from either companies or governments. And we mean any money. Individual contributions, together with foundations grants, are the only source of our funding. Our independence gives us the authority we need to effectively tackle power, and make real change happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace has no permanent friends or foes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exposing threats to the environment and finding solutions we have no permanent allies or adversaries. If your government or company is willing to change we will work with you to achieve your aims. Dither, backtrack or turn around and we will be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters isn’t words, but actions, and, as far as we’re concerned, there’s only one standard in this: The environment has to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seek solutions for, and promote open, informed debate about society's environmental choices. We don’t work to manage environmental problems, we work to eliminate them. That’s why we developed our roadmap to save the seas through the establishment of marine reserves, and an Energy [R]evolution blueprint that points the way to a clean economy. It’s not enough for us to point the finger; we develop, research and promote concrete steps towards a green and peaceful future for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Every year, hundreds of thousands of old computers and mobile phones are dumped in landfills or burned in smelters. Thousands more are exported, often illegally, from the Europe, US, Japan and other industrialised countries, to Asia. There, workers at scrap yards, some of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals and poisons.&lt;/h3&gt;

            A Chinese child sits amongst a pile of wires and e-waste. Children can often be found dismantling e-waste containing many hazardous chemicals known to be potentially very damaging to children's health.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate at which these mountains of obsolete electronic products are growing will reach crisis proportions unless electronics corporations that profit from making and selling these devices face up to their responsibilities. It is possible to make clean, durable products that can be upgraded, recycled, or disposed of safely and don't end up as hazardous waste in someone's backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="box-holder"&gt;
&lt;div class="box"&gt;

&lt;div class="frame"&gt;
&lt;div class="box-content"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Argus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;The Argus is Greenpeace's smallest motor-ship. It mostly works in the Rotterdam (the Netherlands) harbour or along the North sea coast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Argus was built in 1977 by the Swedish navy and was known then as the MS Trymbergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;Greenpeace chartered the ship in 2000.Previously it was used for fishing excursions and navy training at sea in Norway. The vessel was converted and renamed the Argus. Its port of registry is the Leuvehaven, Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Argus is made of light materials and has a double engine so it is a very fast ship. It has a fast zodiac(inflatable speedboat) on board and contains instruments to examine water and soil samples. With the Argus, Greenpeace can investigate contamination, illegal dumping of toxic waste and damage to the environment in the Rotterdam port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;In Greek mythology Argus is a giant man with eyes all over his body so he can watch everything very closely.This is symbolic of the Greenpeace Argus ship, which closely monitors pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Argus mainly campaigns against the production,use and dumping of toxic chemicals. The ship itself is treated with TBT-free paint. TBT is a very toxic chemical that prevents algae from attaching themselves to vessels' hulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action of the Argus was in September 2000. A giant stamp saying "Stop TBT" was attached to the ship's crane and then used to brand ships painted with TBT paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2001 when a ship, the Saga Tide, carrying timber cut from Canadian ancient forests wanted to enter the Netherlands harbour of Flushing; the Argus was there to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During May 2001 Greenpeace used the Argus to help block the heavily contaminated Rotterdam chemical harbour. Greenpeace demanded tha tproducers AKZO, Shell and Shin Etsu cleaned the chemical harbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists could sail to the North Sea on board of the Argus at theend of July 2001. There Greenpeace placed the first offshore windmillin the sea. Exactly at the location where Clyde Petroleum had plannedto drill for gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;The mud in the harbours of Rotterdam, Breskens, Terneuzen and Flushing has been seriously contaminated with TBT. In October the Argus dredged up some of this toxic mud. Part of it was dumped at Atofina in Flushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Port of registry: &lt;/span&gt;Rotterdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Former name: &lt;/span&gt;MS Trymbergen&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Date of charter:&lt;/span&gt; 2 may 2000&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Number of berths: &lt;/span&gt;7&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Inflatables: &lt;/span&gt;1 zodiac&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Helicopter capable: &lt;/span&gt;no&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Type: &lt;/span&gt;patrol vessel&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Built: &lt;/span&gt;1977 in Lunde, Sweden&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Gross tonnage:&lt;/span&gt; 29&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Length:&lt;/span&gt; 19.15m&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Breadth:&lt;/span&gt; 4.10m&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Draught: &lt;/span&gt;1.80m&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Maximum speed: &lt;/span&gt;20,5 knots&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="bodybold"&gt;Engines: &lt;/span&gt;Volvo Penta (2 x 340 s.h.p.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eco Matser, head of the Greenpeace Netherlands toxics department was on board the Argus during an action against toxic mud in Flushing harbour, which was contaminated with the chemical TBT, a common ingredient in ship's paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we sailed into the harbour we received a radio message saying that we were not allowed to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our captain, Hans, stoically answered: 'Yes, so I understand.' But entered the harbour anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dredged up the toxic mud onto the ship. When a police-boat finally arrived, we had almost finished our job. One hour later we took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day I spoke with the harbour master. I told him why we were dredging there. First he threatened to undertake action against Greenpeace. But he also admitted the action had some advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally the harbours have to pay for the costs of dredging. And now Greenpeace was dredging up the contaminated mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;The actions against the chemical TBT were successful. On 5 October the UN International Maritime Organisation decided on a worldwide ban of TBT in ship paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	If you’re pushed for time and can’t meet or write to your representative then give them a call!  Often a minister's office will log calls about an issue so they can get a sense of community concern. By phoning them, you are registering your concern.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="docs-internal-guid-6c025f38-ddfb-3da6-9245-da4c2943e3a5" dir="ltr"&gt;Politicians you may want to call include:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your local Member of Parliament (MP) or the minister responsible for the issue (for example, Minister for the Environment) Find out who they are and their &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/get-involved/contact/00PlibHvYrSayContact1/contact-an-mp"&gt;contact details here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your local council representatives (at city, regional or district councils)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Tips on making a successful phone-call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Introduce yourself and where you live; state how you feel about the legislation or issue and ask them to represent your view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Try to keep to one issue per phone call, the tips on framing your argument and making a specific policy ask under the meet with your representative section are relevant here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Always be polite and be prepared to have a conversation. Be fair, and listen to their reasons for not agreeing with you immediately. Ear bashing your representative is not a good approach. You are much more likely to convince your MP to change their mind or do what you ask by coming across as knowledgeable, reasonable, and passionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Always leave your name and address, especially if you are a local constituent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If the representative is undecided about the issue, ask to be updated on his or her stance after a period of time (by letter or return phone call) or ask for a meeting so you can argue your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Hand written letters are a powerful way to communicate with politicians. It shows a them that you are serious about an issue and allows you to outline your key ideas without pressure. It also often guarantees a response (even if it's not the answer you wanted!).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Who to write to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Politicians you may want to write to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your local Member of Parliament (MP) or the minister responsible for the issue (for example, Minister for the Environment) Find out who they are and their contact details here. &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/get-involved/contact/00PlibHvYrSayContact1/contact-an-mp"&gt; http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/get-involved/contact/00PlibHvYrSayContact1/contact-an-mp &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your local council representatives (at city, regional or district councils)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Tips for effective letter writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tips on framing your argument under ‘the meet with your representative’ section are relevant here. (link to come)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stick to one issue and keep it short and simple (around 400 words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ask your representative to a specific take action or support a specific policy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Provide evidence to back up your opinions. If you have it provide evidence of local support for your issue (like a signed petition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Include relevant newspaper clippings or a briefing paper on the issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ask for a response to your letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Always sign the letter and print your name and address below your signature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you do not receive a response, follow up with a phone call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If their response does not address the issue or answer your question, write again and ask them to clarify their response - don't let them ignore the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Keep all your letters and responses for reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 dir="ltr"&gt;Email your representative&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Email is quick and easy way to tell your politician how you feel. If they get lots of emails on an issue, it shows how the voting public is thinking. Email is effective when numbers count and you want to show support for an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Remember, however, that an email is easily deleted. Because your politician's inbox is probably overflowing, they may not even open your email. If you want a politician to read your words, write them a snail mail letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Suggestions for writing an email:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Treat it as an electronic personal letter. Follow the same rules for form and content that you would when writing a letter (tips above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Avoid symbols, shorthand or email-speak. Write in complete sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Use your subject line. Think carefully about your email subject line so your time-strapped politician knows clearly what the issue is. Put the name of any related legislation in the subject line. This will help them categorise the email and respond more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

	Meeting with politicians in person demonstrates that you feel strongly about an issue and allows you to have a more in-depth conversation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-21d9a035-ddf0-057b-c736-cc15c337af97" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who to meet:&lt;/strong&gt; Find out which electorate you live in and who your elected MP is &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/get-involved/contact/00PlibHvYrSayContact1/contact-an-mp"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; MPs will organise regular times where you can either give them a call and book an appointment to visit them, or (sometimes) simply drop in. MPs with ministerial responsibilities have less time to meet with constituents so it may be difficult to book. Polite persistence is the best strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Be aware of how politics works. In New Zealand, many politicians are required to vote along party lines on most issues (unless there is a conscience vote). So you need to register your concern early in the debate, before the party has reached its position. Otherwise, your local MP may have little time to express their constituents' concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s good to be familiar with the issue you want to discuss and take some examples to back up what you say. But you don’t need to be an expert. In fact, you may find that even with little preparation you are the one who is the expert in the room during your meeting! If you do want to get up to date with the issues Greenpeace works on then check out the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/campaigns/"&gt;what we do pages&lt;/a&gt; for some useful information resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;At the meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Go prepared to have a conversation. Be fair, and listen to their reasons for not agreeing with you immediately. Ear bashing your local MP is not a good idea - at first. You are more likely to convince your representative to change their mind by coming across as knowledgeable, reasonable, and passionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Don't beat around the bush. Tell your MP up front your opinion and what you think they should do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eg. “I ask that you publicly oppose deep sea oil drilling off the coast of Aotearoa NZ and support our multi-billion dollar clean energy industry instead”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Briefly state your argument as to why you think they should do what you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;E.g: “The risks of deep sea drilling to our environment and economy are not worth it. We can have more jobs and prosperity with clean economic development - and that’s the future I want for New Zealand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eg. “Drilling for more dirty fossil fuels is the wrong direction for this country and increases the likelihood of catastrophic climate change. New Zealand belongs on the forefront of clean energy solutions not risky deep sea drilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Make some specific policy asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eg. “I want no more of our deep sea areas offered for oil drilling and all current drilling permits revoked and I want all subsidies and tax breaks to the oil industry removed,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eg. “I want the government to invest more in supporting our clean energy innovators and industries. It’s a cleaner, smarter and safer way of creating jobs and prosperity”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Try to get a clear commitment from your MP, even if it just to meet you again in the coming months to discuss the issue further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;After the meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Write or email to thank the MP for meeting with you and outline what you discussed. In particular, don’t let them forget any promises they made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Set up your next meeting, whether it’s with same MP or another one. There may also be list MPs in your area worth meeting, particularly if they are high up in the party ranks or have a relevant portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t convince your MP that’s OK! You have sown the seed and made sure they know there is opposition out there. The power of that can never be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

	Industrial dairying has failed. Take your pick of victim - our rivers, climate, farmers, reputation -  they’ve all taken a battering.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Intensive farming requires chemical fertiliser, supplementary feed and lots of water. All these inputs increase our climate emissions, degrade our soil and pollute our rivers (two thirds of which are already at times too polluted to swim in safely). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Intensive farming also throws our farmers into debt. New Zealand dairy farmers are now collectively burdened with a staggering &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/299110/banks-will-survive-dairy-downturn-rb"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;$38 billion worth of debt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;And the situation’s about to get worse, with large, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/blog/is-there-a-dirty-big-irrigation-scheme-planne/blog/57409/"&gt;costly irrigation schemes planned throughout the country.&lt;/a&gt; These involve taking large volumes of water from rivers to use on dry pasture to allow more cows.  It’s a double whammy for the rivers. Water is taken from them, then returned polluted thanks to the cows. &lt;img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-14%20at%201.22.35%20pm.png" alt="" width="311" height="233"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;We should be cleaning up and protecting our waterways, not building giant irrigation schemes that will further deplete them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The industrial dairy sector is increasingly relying on irrigation to farm in places that wouldn’t otherwise be viable, such as  South Canterbury and the Hawke’s Bay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;If the Government gets its way, &lt;a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/speech-bluegreens-environmental-conference"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;one million hectares of land will be under irrigation by 2025 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the equivalent of sixteen Lake Taupo’s. River pollution will be inevitable as a result, along with more farmer debt.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s paying for these dams? You!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Despite the risks and downsides of large-scale irrigation, the Government is throwing over &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1603/S00426/funding-for-irrigation-unlocks-potential.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;half a billion taxpayer dollars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at it, and local councils are pouring in &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/301334/dam%27s-cost-jumps-to-more-than-%24900m"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;millions of dollars of ratepayers’ money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s4"&gt; It’s a case of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;public money being used to help a select few and boost big industrial dairy, with ordinary New Zealanders and the environment paying the price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;To protect our rivers and reputation and create sustainable livelihoods for farmers and their families, we need to say no to industrial scale irrigation schemes, propped up with public money.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="p7"&gt;&lt;span class="s5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE ACTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://grnpc.org/IgNns"&gt;&lt;span class="s6"&gt;Sign the petition to stop Government funded river pollution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	The BSA today confirmed the accuracy of criticism made by Greenpeace of the fishing industry and MPI over its awarding video monitoring systems to the industry-owned company, Trident Systems.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Trident complained to the BSA about a Radio New Zealand story on video monitoring in the fishing industry that ran earlier this year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is an own goal by the fishing industry. Trident complained to the BSA that our criticism of the process of awarding of video monitoring contracts by the Ministry of Primary Industry was inaccurate and misleading. But the BSA investigated the complaint, at some considerable length, and found there was strong evidence to support my statements, and rejected the complaint,” said Dr Norman, Greenpeace Executive Director.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fishing industry complaint centred on these comments by Dr Norman:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MPI ran a trial, they ran one company Archipelago, an independent company - their video cameras versus Trident’s, a New Zealand fishing-industry-owned company that was running cameras - and they found that Archipelago found lots of illegal behaviour, dumping killing of Hectors’ dolphins, not reporting it, and Trident came back and found nothing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MPI then went on to award the contract for video monitoring in the Snapper 1 fishery to the fishing industry company Trident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BSA looked into the facts themselves and found that “the statement made by Dr. Norman while summarised and in his own words reflected the [BSA’s own] findings”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The fishing industry went to the BSA to complain that my statements were untrue, only for the BSA to investigate the issue and come to the same finding as I have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The real issue here is that MPI awarded the contract for video monitoring to the fishing industry owned company Trident, after Trident found no wrong-doing in the trial while the independent video monitoring company Archipelago did reveal illegal behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This BSA ruling once again points to the need for a fundamental restructure of the fisheries division of MPI and for a fundamental review of the failed QMS system in New Zealand”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The fishing industry captured the regulator long ago and only by breaking up the fisheries division of MPI and starting again can the people of New Zealand hope that their fisheries will be properly regulated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BSA found in favour of Trident on one issue of fairness, which was simply that the RNZ piece should have gone back to Trident to seek their response to my comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra has launched a “plan” to clean up New Zealand’s waterways but Greenpeace says the dairy giant has failed to address the cow in the room.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“New Zealanders, and our rivers, deserve more than empty headlines from Fonterra” says Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The still un-tackled problem with New Zealand’s rivers is intensification.  Farms are overstocked with too many cows and that causes nitrate to leach down through the soil and into our waterways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and several other scientific institutions have repeatedly drawn a clear link between intensive dairying and water pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Nitrate pollution from too many cows cannot be fixed with fences and planting. The only way to have clean rivers and safe drinking water is to have fewer cows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until Fonterra can commit to reducing the national dairy herd, our rivers will continue to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra was part of the “swimmable rivers” pledge made by farming leadership just before the September election which was widely criticised for its failure to address cow numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fonterra is not going to win back public opinion, or help its farmers, by issuing empty promises and spending megabucks on flashy ad campaigns trying to convince us all that everything is fine with the dirty intensive dairying model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Fonterra, Greenpeace has been championing regenerative farming, a way of farming, with fewer cows and more diversity, which looks after New Zealand’s rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the launch of a short Greenpeace film called “The Regenerators” featuring some of NZ’s leading regenerative farmers, the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation approached the environmental group wanting to showcase the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations has just published a report based on the short film, and Greenpeace’s video has now been viewed nearly 100,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealander’s will quickly get sick of these empty promises from Fonterra and farming leadership while our rivers continue to crash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s time Fonterra and farming leadership started actually doing their job and leading farmers in the transition towards regenerative farming.”&lt;/p&gt;

	The Norwegian oil company at the centre of a high profile Greenpeace protest in the Arctic today is also about to start exploring for deep sea oil in New Zealand waters.



&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Statoil has been granted a 15-year exploration permit for the Northland basin which lies off the coast of Ahipara beach. It will be looking to drill between 1,000 and 2,000 meters below the ocean surface. Seismic testing, using the New Zealand research vessel Tangaroa, is scheduled to start early next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Statoil is another of the big oil companies aggressively pushing into the Arctic frontier and the deep seas of New Zealand in their desperate search for new oil," says Greenpeace New Zealand Energy Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An oil spill in the Arctic's fragile environs would be impossible to clean up and potentially devastate wildlife and local communities. Likewise the spectacular oceans and coastlines of Northland are now the latest in the firing line from the Key government's reckless deep sea drilling agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Statoil should get out of the Arctic and get out of New Zealand too."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Greenpeace International activists from eight countries have scaled a Statoil contracted oil rig to protest the company’s plans to drill the northernmost well in the Norwegian Arctic, close to the Bear Island nature reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists include 32 year old Sini Saarela from Finland, who spent over two months in Russian prison for climbing another Arctic oil rig in September last year. She is currently attached to the oil rig Transocean Spitsbergen and commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bear Island is a breathtaking part of the Arctic and thousands of us are determined to protect it. After visiting this mysterious island for the first time last week, I find it hard to imagine that anyone could be so irresponsible as to threaten it with oil spills. If Statoil caused a major accident here the oil could reach the nesting place of a million seabirds in less than a week”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I took action in Russia last year to stop exactly the same recklessness as I can see here in Norway. We ask everyone to tell the Norwegian government to stop this dangerous rush into the beautiful Arctic environment and rethink its increasingly desperate hunt for oil”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, the Norwegian Environment Agency announced that Statoil’s drilling project would be suspended, pending a complaint from Greenpeace which was backed by 50,000 signatures from its supporters across the world. Monday evening, after heavy pressure from Statoil, the Ministry of Environment lifted the suspension, despite the fact that the Minister of Environment has not finalized her verdict. Greenpeace has condemned the Ministry’s decision and is calling on the Minister of Environment Tine Sundtoft to stop the drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace International activists from eight countries scaled the Statoil oil rig Transocean Spitsbergen at 5:00 Central European Time in the Barents Sea, 175 kilometres from the Bear Island nature reserve. The activists have food and supplies to stay on the rig for several days. Meanwhile, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza will keep on protesting peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate direct action last night, activists from Greenpeace Netherlands blocked a Gazprom operated drill rig in the port of IJmuiden on its way to the Russian Arctic. The group said the two protests were evidence of a growing global campaign against oil drilling in the high north which has attracted five million signatures worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pictures &amp;amp; video from the activity will soon be available on: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://photo.greenpeace.org/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;amp;ALID=27MZIF3CYY_Y&amp;amp;CT=Album" target="_blank"&gt;http://photo.greenpeace.org/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;amp;ALID=27MZIF3CYY_Y&amp;amp;CT=Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The company partially responsible for one of the worst oil spills in history has unfettered access to the New Zealand Parliament, warns Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmental organisation is calling on the new Government to end special treatment of corporate lobbyists at the Beehive.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Oil drilling giant, Anadarko, is among the corporations issued with parliamentary access cards that let them come and go as they please.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Steve Abel, says representatives from one of the most polluting companies on the planet should at least have to go through parliamentary security.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Citizens, not corporations, should be at the heart of governance,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Anadarko was fined $159 million for its involvement in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, one of the largest marine oil spills in history.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It’s also on the list of 100 companies that are responsible for 71% of global climate emissions since 1988.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The new Speaker of the House, Trevor Mallard, has announced he will be reviewing the list of access card holders over the coming month.  Greenpeace has written a letter to Mallard asking him to end privileged access for corporate lobbyists. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Abel says Anadarko’s long and controversial history in New Zealand is a “clear example” of the consequences of an unequal balance of power between the public and corporate lobbyists.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In response to extensive protest against deep sea oil drilling here in 2011 and 2012, the former National Government pushed through the Crown Minerals Amendment Act 2013, dubbed the ‘Anadarko Amendment’, which criminalised peaceful protest at sea,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=44487"&gt;It was opposed&lt;/a&gt; by tens of thousands of people and several legal authorities, including former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and Sir Peter Williams QC.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The law change became known as the ‘Anadarko Amendment’, because the Texan Oil Giant was one of the immediate potential beneficiaries of the legislation. “&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In late 2013 and early 2014, Anadarko conducted two high risk exploratory oil drills in New Zealand’s deep sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says the new Government now has an opportunity get rid of the hangover of corporate access to Parliament and start afresh.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It’s an affront to our democracy that a small minority of corporate lobbyists are given more access and power to decision makers than civil society representatives or ordinary New Zealand citizens,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Oil giants like Anadarko are destroying our climate and threatening our oceans and coastlines with oil spills. They’re modern-day villains, yet get the right to skip security when they go into our Parliament to lobby for their dirty industry.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Other lobby groups and companies with access cards include Fonterra and Federated Farmers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Abel says Fonterra should have no more access to our politicians than civil society representatives or ordinary New Zealanders wanting to swim in clean rivers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The time for cleaning up New Zealand’s rivers has come, yet Fonterra and Federated Farmers, already with huge influence to lobby vigorously against any laws which make them accountable for their climate emissions and water pollution, have special access cards to Parliament,” he says.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We hope that the new Government will seize the opportunity to end this undemocratic practice and cancel lobbyists’ parliamentary access cards.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	29 October 2017 - Greenpeace has launched a global campaign for an Antarctic Sanctuary, covering 1.8 million square kilometres of ocean, to protect whales, penguins and other wildlife as Antarctic nations fall short on marine protection.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GP018I4_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a failure to agree strong marine protection in the East Antarctic [1], Greenpeace has called for governments to show “greater vision and ambition” in the coming year and create the largest protected area on Earth: an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Antarctic Sanctuary would be five times the size of Germany, in the Weddell Sea, next to the Antarctic peninsula. [2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Over the next 12 months we have an opportunity to make history: to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary which would be the largest protected area on Earth’ said Russel Norman, Greenpeace NZ executive director. “Ocean sanctuaries not only protect incredible wildlife like whales and penguins, but they ensure healthy oceans which soak up carbon dioxide and help us to tackle climate change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year's summit in Hobart saw a massive US and New Zealand-backed marine protected area (MPA) established around the Ross Sea. “We hope to see the new Labour-led Government take every opportunity to help make this new sanctuary a reality,” said Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new proposal, submitted by the EU and championed by the German Government, will be considered in October 2018 by the governments responsible for management of the Antarctic marine environment (CCAMLR), which have just concluded this year’s proceedings, having failed to agree strong marine protection in the East Antarctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“From great blue whales to vast colonies of Emperor and Adélie penguins, Antarctic wildlife is already under acute pressure from climate change and now industrial fishing vessels are vacuuming up the tiny shrimp-like krill which Antarctic life relies upon. The fishing industry simply can’t be allowed to expand their operations and steal food from threatened penguins and whales. We now have a unique opportunity to make sure that doesn't happen,” said Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have just 12 months to create the largest protected area on Earth. With almost half our planet made up of waters outside of national borders, and an urgent global need for more large ocean sanctuaries, governments now need to show greater vision and ambition to protect what belongs to us all.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Rogers, Professor of Conservation Biology, University of Oxford said:  &lt;br&gt;“If we’re going to avoid the worst effects of climate change and protect biodiversity we need to safeguard more than 30% of our oceans and the Antarctic is a fantastic place to start. Threats to the Antarctic are increasing, such as climate change and pollution, including from plastics and fishing. Creating large marine reserves can allow these ecosystems to remain in a fully diverse and functional state. Furthermore, the importance of Antarctic ecosystems in sequestering carbon is only now being realised. There is a narrow window of time for governments to work together to protect the oceans so the time for action is now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] The East Antarctic Marine Protected Area aims to protect representative areas of open ocean and seabed biodiversity in East Antarctica. It comprises the following areas: MacRobertson, Drygalski and D’Urville Sea-Mertz. The proposal was prepared by the European Union and Australia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] Greenpeace is campaigning for an Antarctic Sanctuary covering 1.8 million square kilometres in the Weddell Sea. The proposal has been submitted by the EU and backed by the German Government. It will be considered when CCAMLR next convenes, in October 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) was established by international convention in 1982 with the objective of conserving Antarctic marine life. It consists of 25 members.

	The United Nations has turned a few Kiwi’ farmers into international role models for their efforts to combat water pollution and climate change by farming in a new way. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Not long after Greenpeace launched a short film called “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKMM2b6srIg"&gt;The Regenerators&lt;/a&gt;” featuring some of the leading regenerative farmers in New Zealand the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation approached the environmental advocacy group wanting to showcase the farmers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The United Nations has just published a report based on the short film, and Greenpeace’s video has now been viewed nearly 100,000 times.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner Gen Toop says they are “chuffed” that New Zealand’s regenerative farmers are getting the recognition they deserve.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The farmers that star in our film, have gone much further than just fencing off the odd stream and planting some riverbanks, they’re farming in a fundamentally different way and we believe their model is the future of agriculture,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The way they farm is literally regenerating the ecological value of the land instead of stripping it away like industrial farming commonly does”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s great to see the ground-breaking work these Kiwi farmers are doing is being recognised internationally by the United Nations.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regenerative farming is a way of farming which prioritises growing diversity and healthy soil and essentially works with nature and ecology not against it. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some of the techniques include; diversifying pastures, crops and animals, reducing costly and environmentally damaging inputs like chemical fertilisers and lowering stocking rates.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The farmers in Greenpeace’s video and on the UN profile are running profitable farms and report, more importantly, that they have a great quality of life.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Industrial agriculture particularly industrial livestock farming, is one of the world’s biggest polluters.  But regenerative farmers are turning farming itself into the solution for clean rivers and a safe climate.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“With public concern over water pollution and climate change at an all time high, intensive dairying’s social license is all but lost.  We believe that regenerative farming is really the only option for New Zealand agriculture going forward” says Toop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite global momentum behind this new model of agriculture, relatively little is known about it here in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The former Government and the farming leadership have ignored regenerative farming.  Instead they’ve incentivized and supported intensive agriculture, which has polluted our rivers and caused huge public upset.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After the video was launched we had farmers contact us seeking help to transition their farms from conventional to regenerative.  The fact that farmers are having to come to Greenpeace for help makes it pretty clear that they aren’t getting what they need from their leadership”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fonterra has been too busy spending megabucks on flashy ad campaigns trying to convince us all that everything is fine with the dirty intensive dairying model.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We hope now that regenerative farming in New Zealand has received this kind of international attention, that the farming leadership and the new Government will start getting in behind it”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More information:&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace film ‘The Regenerators’ can be seen here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKMM2b6srIg"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKMM2b6srIg &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report is currently featured on the FAO website:&lt;br&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/a-bt439e.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

	In June this year, 26-year old Hamilton law student, Sarah Thomson, spent five days in court challenging the Government over climate change targets she called “unambitious and irrational”. The case was the first of its kind in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Court has just released findings that former Minister for Climate Change, Tim Grosser, acted unlawfully by failing to review New Zealand’s climate change response targets after the UN published an updated report on climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Because incoming Minister, James Shaw, has already indicated that he will be setting a new target, the Court has not issued a formal order requiring the new Government to review its climate targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thomson has said she will look to appeal the decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In response to today’s verdict, Greenpeace campaigner Amanda Larsson says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Sarah’s brave legal fight is an example of how her generation is stepping up to take responsibility for climate change. Today’s verdict gives the new Government a strong mandate to strengthen its ambition,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called climate change the ‘nuclear free moment’ of her generation. This epic court battle has created a national conversation around our responsibility to look after future generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “If Prime Minister Ardern is serious about making climate change her nuclear free moment, she will need to honour these strong words with strong action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The new Government’s target to bring climate emissions to zero by 2050 is bold, but it requires a strong plan and good policies in the immediate term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Ramping up ambition on climate change means putting an end to all new fossil fuel extraction in New Zealand. It means saying no to seismic blasting for oil off our coasts. And it means hastening the transition to 100% renewable energy and clean transport.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	At the time of the bombing, the Rainbow Warrior was about to lead a group of anti-nuclear testing vessels into the Pacific. To appreciate why the ship was bombed by the French government, it's important to understand the political environment of the time, and how Greenpeace's campaign against testing in the Pacific was so significant.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;Background to the bombing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was about to lead a flotilla of anti-nuclear testing vessels to Moruroa Atoll in French Polynesia. To appreciate why the Rainbow Warrior was bombed, it is important to first understand how nuclear testing in the Pacific became such a controversial issue.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; On 6 August 1945, the United States dropped a new and devastating weapon in the form of an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima in Japan. Three days later it dropped another atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki. The USA dropped these nuclear weapons to speed up the end of the war against Japan and avoid a costly ground invasion of the Japanese home islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world had never seen such powerful weapons of mass destruction. Each bomb was more powerful than 10,000 tons of TNT explosive. Entire sections of the cities were totally destroyed and tens of thousands of men, women and children were killed outright or in the days and weeks afterwards. These bombs released radioactive fallout which contaminated the environment. Many people would die later from exposure to radiation. Women gave birth to deformed babies. To this day, historians argue about whether or not such weapons should ever have been used against Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="The Rainbow Warrior" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP0HJQ_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="The Rainbow Warrior" width="600" height="403"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Rainbow Warrior at sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, tension developed between the USA and the USSR. What became known as the Cold War (1945-1991) began, where the two superpowers and their allies competed to spread their different forms of government across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USA and the USSR competed to produce the most powerful nuclear weapons in order to ensure their security. Governments now knew that if they launched nuclear weapons at another nuclear power, they would most likely be destroyed by their opponent’s weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides very nearly started a nuclear war over the Cuban Missile Crisis. Given the fragile post-World War II climate, the nuclear powers became careful not to provoke each other.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The USA, Britain and France sought remote areas to develop their nuclear weapons. Up until the 1960s, atmospheric nuclear tests were carried out in the Pacific by these powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USA used the Marshall Islands. The British used Christmas Island and the Australian outback. France moved its testing programme from Algeria to French Polynesia in 1966. Nuclear devices were suspended by balloons high above the ground and detonated so that scientists could take measurements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Atmospheric testing meant that radioactive fallout was carried by the wind for vast distances, which contaminated the environment. Significant numbers of people living on nearby islands like Rongelap in the Marshall Islands have since developed cancer. Women have had miscarriages and some have given birth to deformed babies (known as “jellyfish babies”).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; From the late 1950s people in many countries became very concerned about the effects of nuclear testing on people and the environment. Many people in the Pacific argued that if the tests were safe, why did the nuclear powers not test in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USA and Britain stopped testing in the South Pacific in the early 1960s. Protest movements started up and the governments of Vanuatu, New Zealand, Australia and others called on France to stop testing at Moruroa Atoll. The French Government refused to stop tests and downplayed the risks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In June 1972, Greenpeace yacht Vega sailed into the forbidden zone outside Moruroa Atoll to stop the upcoming nuclear test by its presence. This was an extremely dangerous protest action, as the crew could be be exposed to nuclear fallout from the explosion. David McTaggart (the skipper), Nigel Graham and Grant Davidson made blocks to seal the vents, to stop radioactive fallout entering the cabin. It was agreed that if they survived the nuclear blast and shockwave one crew member would expose himself on the deck to start the engine and motor out of the danger zone. After being ordered to leave, McTaggart refused to follow a French naval vessel out of the zone. This resulted in a chase where the Vega was rammed and McTaggart and crew were put in detention. Although the test went ahead, the Greenpeace action raised global awareness about the issue and put pressure on France to stop testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Nuclear testing" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/nuclear-weapons-test-67557_1280.jpg" alt="Nuclear testing" width="600" height="314"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nuclear testing in the Pacific became a target of a Greenpeace campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand and Australian governments took France to the International Court of Justice in 1973 to try to stop the tests. However, France refused to follow the court’s ruling that it should stop testing. Norman Kirk, the New Zealand Prime Minister, sent two New Zealand navy frigates to protest on the edge of the Moruroa testing area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flotilla of civilian yachts were also protesting, including the Greenpeace yacht Vega skippered again by David McTaggart. Frustrated by McTaggart’s persistent non-violent protest actions, the French military boarded the Vega, where they severely beat McTaggart and one of his crew. He was hospitalised and lost vision in one of his eyes for several months. The French government tried to say his injuries were from a fall, but a crew member from the Vega smuggled out photos of the beating. This caused outrage in the international media and the French government was left humiliated.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace was seen as a group of troublemakers by some members of the French government and military. The French navy found it very difficult to deal with non-violent protesters who would not cooperate. The protests led to the French abandoning atmospheric tests in favour of underground tests during 1974. However, protests at Moruroa continued in the hope that underground tests would also be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, Greenpeace sent its ship Rainbow Warrior on a Pacific Peace Voyage. The ship would help to evacuate the people of Rongelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands. In 1954, the US tested a nuclear weapon on Bikini Atoll which was one thousand times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The people of Rongelap, 150 kilometres away, were not warned about the test and suffered from the radioactive contamination for decades afterwards. Eventually they asked Greenpeace to help move them to a new, uncontaminated atoll. Once the Rongelapese had been relocated, the ship would sail to Vanuatu and on to New Zealand. From Auckland, the Rainbow Warrior would lead a flotilla of vessels to Mururoa Atoll, in French Polynesia, to protest against the upcoming French nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why did the French bomb the Rainbow Warrior?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French government saw its nuclear testing programme as essential for France's security (even though a nuclear armed world is hardly a secure one). But negative publicity about the testing would put pressure on the French government to stop its programme. It was for this reason that the French government wanted to stop the Rainbow Warrior's upcoming anti-nuclear protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior was a large vessel which could act as a flagship for the smaller protest yachts. French naval vessels would not be able to intimidate it as easily as the other, more fragile yachts. The Rainbow Warrior could carry large amounts of supplies, which meant that it could protest for a long period of time. The communications equipment on board would allow the crew to maintain radio contact with the outside world and send up-to-the-minute reports and photos to international news organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French navy would find it extremely difficult to deal with the non-violent tactics of the protest vessels. To avoid this, the French secret service DGSE was ordered to launch “Operation Satanique,” where French secret service agents were sent to New Zealand to sink the Rainbow Warrior before it could lead the protest flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

	As Coca Cola launch their new ‘Holidays are coming’ Christmas TV advertisement, some of the brand’s fans have been viewing a version that’s a little more realistic. In an attempt to take advantage of Coke’s huge PR push at this time of year, Greenpeace has produced their own Coke Christmas ad, launched on the same day, highlighting an unfortunate side effect of bottled fizzy drinks.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The video shows a montage of happy family Christmases, with spookily familiar music and lots of subtle signs that all is not quite as it should be. Just out of shot, a red-lit truck casts its rosy glow on the celebrants as it passes by. The final scene shows the dump truck, laden with plastic waste, driving across a beach and into the surf, where the Santa-suited driver tips his load into the sea, and throws the Coke bottle he is drinking from after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgreenpeace.nz%2Fvideos%2F10154379578884229%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The film’s final message reads –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote title="video end card"&gt;A truckload of plastic enters the ocean every minute.&lt;br&gt;Coca-Cola produce an estimated 110 billion plastic bottles a year.&lt;br&gt;Many of these end up in landfill, on beaches &amp;amp; in the ocean.&lt;br&gt;Don’t let Coke choke our oceans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is waking up to the plastic crisis in our oceans. We produced more plastic in the last ten years than during the entire twentieth century, less than ten percent of it gets recycled, and it lasts for centuries, for the sake of products we only used for seconds. Two million tonnes of plastic bottles are made each year, and many of them end up in our oceans, where they choke sea life and gradually break down into plastic dust that spreads throughout the food chain, from plankton to your plate," said Elena Di Palma, Greenpeace NZ, plastics campaigner.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Coca Cola is the world’s biggest soft drinks producer and the source of over a hundred billion disposable plastic bottles every year. They have the power to change how drinks are packaged, and how that packaging is managed. This Christmas, we’re asking Coke to show some goodwill to our oceans and shrink their enormous plastic footprint.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A link to the video has been sent to Greenpeace supporters, and has been viewed over 250,000 times in the 12 hours since launch, and it has also been dotted around the internet for Coke enthusiasts, desperate for a sneak preview of Coke’s latest ad, to stumble across.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	He joined the crew of the Rainbow Warrior to bring his pictures of French nuclear testing to the world. When secret service agents bombed the ship, they killed Fernando Pereira, a man who dedicated his life to peace. A determined photographer, a family man, a Rainbow Warrior – he will always be remembered. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The bombers struck just before midnight on 10 July 1985 as two separate explosions ripped through the hull of the Rainbow Warrior. The second explosion knocked Fernando Pereira unconscious below deck, and as the Warrior swiftly sank, he drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Fernando during the evacuation of Rongelap" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP0T6F_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Fernando during the evacuation of Rongelap" width="600" height="385"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fernando during the evacuation of Rongelap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando was born in the town of Chaves in Portugal. As a young man, he fled Portugal to neighbouring Spain to avoid being forced to join the army and fight in the dictator Salazar’s war in Angola. Spain was no safe haven for political refugees at the time, so he travelled for hundreds of kilometres on foot and by hitchhiking until he reached the Netherlands, where he decided to settle. He met and married a Dutch woman, had a family, and pursued his passion for photography.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; By 1985, Fernando was a freelance photographer for Greenpeace, and he signed on for the Rainbow Warrior’s six month Pacific voyage. He was a part of the team evacuating the people of Rongelap Atoll, which had been severely contaminated with radioactive fallout following nuclear testing in the region by the USA. His photographs of the evacuation are profoundly moving and showed his professionalism as a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Greenpeace crew evacuate residents of Rongelap" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP017ZS_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Greenpeace crew evacuate residents of Rongelap" width="600" height="419"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Fernando's many images of the Rongelap evacuation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando was a popular crew member who had a great zest for life and a deep conviction for the causes he believed in. If he had not been killed, he would have photographed the protests at Moruroa Atoll.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Three months earlier, he had farewelled his two children in the Netherlands. His daughter Marelle remembers him saying “Just take care of your mom, I’ll do my trip and I’ll be home soon”. She was eight years old. After he left, she went walking in the forest with her brother Paul, who “waved to every plane because that could be the one my dad was in”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Fernando and Marelle" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/pasted%20image%200.png" alt="Fernando and Marelle" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fernando and Marelle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their innocent young lives would be shattered by the news to come from New Zealand some months later.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “During the summer we went to camp, we were playing a game with a ball with my friends, then one of our teachers came up to me and asked if I could join her because she had something to tell me. My mom was there and I thought that was pretty strange. I did not know what to think of that, so I walked with her to where my mother was sitting with an uncle of mine, but over there I got a strange feeling, I don’t know how to explain that, but I knew something had to be wrong with my dad. It had to be; otherwise my mom would have come over there and talked to me. By the time that I got to my mom she was in tears”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The moment that she said he was missing, all the pieces fell together and I cried together with my mom. We packed our bags that afternoon and she took me home. We waited for the news which eventually was of my dad turning up dead”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Marelle Pereira, pictured in 2005" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP04QRX_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Marelle Pereira, pictured in 2005" width="600" height="401"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marelle Pereira (middle) pictured in 2005, on the 20th anniversary of her father's death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Legacy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marelle and Paul's lives were changed forever as they grew up without their much loved dad. The French government paid some compensation to his family, but not all of his killers were brought to justice. Twenty years later Marelle gave her view on this.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “What I would like to see happen now...Justice for us, justice for the family if they could tell the truth that would be a beginning, and Mitterrand promising justice at the highest level, if that is justice, letting so many agents escape jail, then that is not justice, not in our eyes and I hope not in the world's eyes. And, it is never too late for justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Fernando Pereira at Rongelap, 17 May 1985" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Rainbow-Warrior/GP02HJN_Web_size_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Fernando Pereira at Rongelap, 17 May 1985" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fernando Pereira at Rongelap, 17 May 1985&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 10 July 2010, the 25th anniversary of Fernando’s death, a wreath was laid for him. Peter Willcox, the skipper of the Rainbow Warrior on the night of his death, made this tribute to him:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Fernando did not have to die...We will never forget him. I hope the generations of activists who sail on the new ship will be as determined and as exceptional and as inspired as he was.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Fernando’s memory remains an inspiration to people who campaign for a green and peaceful future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the Rainbow Warrior II was boarded by French commandos, as it led a further protest against nuclear testing in Moruroa Atoll. When Greenpeace activists were asked for their names, they only gave one: Fernando Pereira.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Rainbow Warrior bombing took place on July 10, 1985, but it had been in the planning for months, and had repercussions that would last for years.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;1985&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 April:&lt;/strong&gt; French agent Christine Huguette Cabon arrives in Auckland and starts working for Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 May:&lt;/strong&gt; Christine Huguette Cabon departs New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 June:&lt;/strong&gt; The French yacht ‘Ouvea’ departs Noumea, New Caledonia for New Zealand. On board are French agents Roland Verge, Gerald Andries, Jean-Michel Bartelo and Xavier Maniguet.They have on board a zodiac boat, outboard motor, diving equipment and explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 June:&lt;/strong&gt; French yacht Ouvea arrives at Parengarenga Harbour, Northland. French agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur arrive in Auckland and rent a campervan to meet with the ‘Ouvea’ crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 June:&lt;/strong&gt; French agent Louis Pierre Dillais arrives in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 July: &lt;/strong&gt;The Rainbow warrior arrives in Auckland. French agents Jean Cammas and Jean Luc Kister arrive in Auckland to carry out the bombing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 July:&lt;/strong&gt; The French yacht ‘Ouvea’ departs Whangarei for Norfolk Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 July:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rainbow Warrior is sunk by two bombs. Fernando Pereira is killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 July:&lt;/strong&gt; French agents Dillais, Cammas and Klister cross cook Strait to the South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Mafart and Prieur are caught by police while returning their campervan. The French government denies involvement in the bombing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 July:&lt;/strong&gt; NZ Police detectives interview 3 of the ‘Ouvea’ crew on Norfolk Island. They gather evidence but have to release them. The yacht later disappears on the voyage to Noumea and the crew turn up in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 July:&lt;/strong&gt; French agent Louis Pierre Dillais flies to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 July:&lt;/strong&gt; French agents Jean Cammas and Jean Luc Kister fly from Auckland to Tahiti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 August:&lt;/strong&gt; Mafart and Prieur are charged with murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 August:&lt;/strong&gt; French Prime Minister Fabius announces an inquiry into who was responsible for the bombing. Bernard Tricot is to lead the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 August:&lt;/strong&gt; The French Tricot inquiry clears the French authorities of involvement in the bombing. The Tricot report states that the agents were only gathering intelligence about the upcoming anti-nuclear testing protests at Mururoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 September:&lt;/strong&gt; The French Le Monde newspaper makes allegations of French involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 September:&lt;/strong&gt; French Defence Minister Charles Hernu resigns and DGSE head Pierre Lacoste is sacked over the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 September:&lt;/strong&gt; French Prime Minister Fabius makes a television broadcast stating that French agents of the DGSE sank the Rainbow Warrior. They were under orders and therefore would not be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 November:&lt;/strong&gt; Mafart and Prieur plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter and wilful damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 November:&lt;/strong&gt; Mafart and Prieur are sentenced to 10 years' jail in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1986&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July:&lt;/strong&gt; France pays New Zealand NZ$13m. Prieur and Mafart are sent to Hao Atoll in French Polynesia for three years to serve their sentence. Prieur's husband joins her there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1987&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 October:&lt;/strong&gt; France is ordered to pay Greenpeace more than US$8.1m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 December:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rainbow Warrior is scuttled at Matauri Bay off Northland's coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 December:&lt;/strong&gt; Alain Mafart returns to France due to illness. He is later decorated and promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1988&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 May:&lt;/strong&gt; Dominique Prieur returns to France early due to pregnancy. She is later decorated and promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is not and never has been “anti-farming”. In fact we see working with the land to produce food to feed people as one of the best professions around.

But we can’t keep farming the way we are if we want the best for our water, land, climate and farmers.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We’re advocating a win-win way forward. It's called ecological farming. If “eco-farming” sounds too complicated, try “better”, “sustainable” or “smarter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-14%20at%201.23.01%20pm.png" alt="" width="592" height="391"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eco-farming combines modern science and innovation with respect for nature and biodiversity. It protects the soil, water and climate. It ensures healthy farming and healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eco-farming works with, rather than against, natural ecosystems - protecting and using them to improve soil and water health, control weeds, pests and diseases and create resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ticket to healthy livestock, healthy crops, and healthy bottom lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2017, we travelled the country to meet with farmers who are already using regenerative farming techniques to restore health back to their land. They’re diversifying pastures and farm systems, building healthy soil, reducing costly and environmentally damaging inputs like chemical fertiliser and reducing their cow numbers - and are seeing the benefits already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKMM2b6srIg" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studies prove that eco farming works. Here in New Zealand an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907005757"&gt;AgResearch report&lt;/a&gt; found that a low-input system with less cows per hectare and no chemical nitrogen fertilizer produced the most milk per cow per year. The study also confirmed that the low input system is the best environmental performer, the least financially risky and is most profitable when milk-price payouts are low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many New Zealand farmers are already &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/rural/251977/high-country-farmer-wins-award"&gt;switched on to this,&lt;/a&gt; rejecting high input intensive dairying and running profitable, low-input, environmentally-sound farms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-14%20at%201.23.44%20pm.png" alt="" width="593" height="390"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, we’ve launched a Freshwater Rescue Plan in conjunction with several other organisations - including Forest &amp;amp; Bird, the Public Health Association and Fish and Game - giving the government seven steps to save New Zealand’s precious waterways. You can read the &lt;a title="Freshwater Rescue Plan" href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/the-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;seven step plan here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not just about dairying though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through ecological farming New Zealand could be producing clean, green, high-value food products across the board. This is what the world’s consumers are increasingly demanding - food with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-10-04%20at%204.24.55%20pm.png" alt="" width="592" height="442"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work we’re doing on farming here in New Zealand is part of a revolutionary global campaign to clean up food and farming systems around the world.

	Auckland, 4 December 2012 - Today’s announcement that Petrobras has pulled out of its deep sea oil drilling plans for New Zealand is a victory for Kiwis opposed to risky deep sea drilling, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A campaign by East Cape iwi Te Whanau a Apanui, Greenpeace and other groups against Petrobras’ exploration of the Raukumara Basin started early last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The likelihood of oil from a deep sea blowout washing onto the beautiful beaches and coastline of the East Cape and Bay of Plenty just went down by 100 per cent,” says Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“However you look at this, it really calls into question the Government’s petroleum plans. Not only is it an environmental and economic risk if it proceeds, but it is a serious economic gamble which depends on the whims and fortunes of foreign oil companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is yet another blow to Steven Joyce’s business growth strategy that is so intimately linked to the interests of overseas oil and mining companies. His policy is to play Russian roulette with our coastlines, beaches and our prosperity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Instead, a responsible Government would give its full support to our world-leading clean energy sector which will create local jobs and grow our economy without risking our beaches or increasing pollution.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Home-grown Kiwi innovators can be the bedrock of the future clean smart economy by capturing some of the trillions of dollars being invested in the global clean technology sector. Last year, more money was invested around the world in clean energy generation than in fossil fuels (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign against Petrobras’ drilling plans has included;&lt;br&gt;•    An historic protest flotilla in April 2011 that harried Petrobras’ seismic testing off East Cape for 42 days and led to the arrest of local fisherman Elvis Teddy.&lt;br&gt;•    A legal challenge in June 2012 by Te Whanau a Apanui and Greenpeace based on a Judicial Review of the Government’s issuing of the permit to Petrobras. The Judicial Review was unsuccessful and has been appealed.&lt;br&gt;•    A petition (delivered to Parliament on 24 July, 2012) of over 140,000 New Zealanders calling on the Government to abandon its fossil fuels agenda, in favour of clean energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2012, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, UNEP. http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsreport2012final.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 11 December, 2012 – The Government should drop its deep sea oil programme as a failed economic strategy following low interest in its permits to drill in deep water around New Zealand, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement that there were only three applications for the 11 permits for deep sea drilling comes just a week after the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras pulled out of drilling in the Raukumara Basin off the East Cape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Significantly, there are no new overseas companies which shows New Zealand is not regarded by the international oil industry as a prime destination, says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The lack of interest in the permits is a very strong signal that the Government’s deep sea oil programme is not the economic boom that was promised.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Of the three permits awarded two are at extreme depths of over 2700 metres off the coast of Kaikoura and Wellington. This is nearly twice as deep as the Deepwater Horizon disaster site in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"One of New Zealand's most iconic regions - the Kaikoura coast, world famous for its whale and dolphin watching - is now right in the spill zone for a deep sea oil blow-out.  Other potential regions hit by a Pegasus basin disaster would be the intricate coasts of the Marlborough Sounds and the Cook Strait and Wellington coasts and beaches."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far the Deepwater Horizon oil blow-out has cost the US economy over $40 billion and led to an area twice the size of New Zealand’s North Island being closed to fishing due to pollution risks to seafood. Such an impact on New Zealand’s fishing and tourism industries would cripple the country and destroy the country’s clean and green international reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government should drop this risky programme and give its full support to our world-leading clean energy sector which will create local jobs and grow our economy without risking our beaches or increasing pollution,” says Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“However you look at this, it really calls into question the Government’s petroleum plans. Not only is it an environmental and economic risk if it proceeds, but it is a serious economic gamble which depends on the whims and fortunes of foreign oil companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even the Government and oil industry association admitted last week that there were big shifts in the global markets and that our reserves were a challenge to get to, reducing further the chance of any economic benefit to the country.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Home-grown Kiwi innovators can be the bedrock of the future clean smart economy by capturing some of the trillions of dollars being invested in the global clean technology sector.

	Auckland, 20 November 2012 - Global electronic companies must do more to end the use of climate changing dirty energy in their manufacturing and supply chains, according to a report released today by Greenpeace International.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While these companies have made progress at removing toxic chemicals from the mobile phones, computers and tablets they produce, their manufacturing and supply chains are still too heavily dependent on dirty energy sources that are contributing to climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International’s 18th version of the &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/" target="_top"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; [1] ranked 16 electronics companies based on their commitment and progress in three environmental criteria: Energy and Climate, Greener Products and Sustainable Operations.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;"The next big environmental challenge for consumer electronics companies is to reduce their carbon pollution," said Greenpeace International IT analyst Casey Harrell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Consumers have stated that they want greener electronics, which means high functioning gadgets that are built and powered by renewable energy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bulk of the carbon footprint associated with many electronic devices is buried in the manufacturing chain, where the electronic devices are assembled. More carbon is used in the manufacture of some gadgets, such as tablets and smart phones, than consumers ever use after buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Companies should work with their suppliers to implement more efficient manufacturing processes and to power the supply chain with renewable energy, not fossil fuels, just as they have successfully done to reduce the toxic materials in electronics," Harrell said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As global electronics use grows, only corporate environmental leadership can prevent increased electronic waste and ensure that the industry transitions to using clean energy to manufacture its products. Electronic companies have also gained political power in many countries, meaning their advocacy for clean energy can impact government policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian technology firm Wipro topped the ranking in its first appearance in the International version of the Guide to Greener Electronics. [2] Wipro scored the most points due to its efforts to embrace renewable energy and advocacy for greener energy policies in India. Wipro also scored well for post-consumer e-waste collection for recycling and for phasing out hazardous substances from its products. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Wipro has set a new benchmark for sustainability, not only in India but across the globe, that will have a long-term impact in shaping the green energy debate in the electronics industry,” said Greenpeace India Senior Campaigner Abhishek Pratap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The rest of the electronics sector should follow in the footsteps of Wipro’s climate leadership.”                                                                           &lt;br&gt;HP dropped from No. 1 in last year’s edition of the guide to No. 2. Nokia moved up from No. 4 to No. 3. Taiwanese computer maker Acer was the most improved company in the guide, moving up nine spots to No. 4 for engaging with its suppliers on greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous substances, conflict minerals and fibre sourcing. Dell dropped from No. 3 to No. 5. Apple dropped slightly from No. 5 in last year’s edition to No. 6. Blackberry maker RIM did not improve from its 16th ranking, the bottom of the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics, launched in 2006, has prompted improvements within the electronics industry, including the phase-out of hazardous substances from products. [3] The guide is part of Greenpeace’s wider campaign to push the IT industry to develop the solutions needed for a global clean energy revolution. [4] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is a politically and financially independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace. Greenpeace supports the reuse and repair of electronic products and encourages individuals to extend the working life of their gadgets, to buy used products when possible and to buy new products only when truly necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTES TO EDITOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.This year’s 18th Guide to Greener Electronics: http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/&lt;br&gt;2.Wipro and three other Indian consumer electronic companies were assessed separately in a version of the Guide to Greener Electronics specifically for Indian companies, using the same set of criteria from 2007 – 2011. The current edition of the guide merges the Indian version and the international version.&lt;br&gt;3.

	Industrial dairying has failed. Take your pick of victim - our rivers, water, climate, farmers, reputation -  they’ve all taken a battering.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Industrial dairying requires chemical fertiliser, supplementary feed and lots of water. All these inputs increase our climate emissions, degrade our soil and pollute our rivers (two thirds of which are already at times too polluted to swim in safely). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-bV6gb138U" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand now has the highest rates of waterborne gastro disease in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the impact of intensive agriculture on human health in our ‘&lt;a title="Sick of Too Many Cows " href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/554c41a2#/554c41a2/1" target="_blank"&gt;Sick of Too Many Cows’&lt;/a&gt; report, published in June 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/artwork/openspace/Screen%20Shot%202016-10-04%20at%204.09.07%20pm.png" alt="" width="595" height="194"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial dairy farming also throws our farmers into debt. New Zealand dairy farmers are now collectively burdened with a staggering $38 billion worth of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the situation’s about to get worse, with large, costly irrigation schemes planned throughout the country. See &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/blog/is-there-a-dirty-big-irrigation-scheme-planne/blog/57409/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for what might be happening near you. These schemes involve taking large volumes of water from rivers to use on dry pasture to allow more cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a double whammy for the rivers. &lt;strong&gt;Water is taken from them, then returned polluted thanks to cow effluent, urine and eroded soil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/artwork/openspace/Screen%20Shot%202016-10-04%20at%204.09.26%20pm.png" alt="" width="604" height="397"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be cleaning up and protecting our waterways, not building industrial irrigation schemes that will further degrade them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrial dairy sector is increasingly relying on irrigation to farm in places that wouldn’t otherwise be viable, such as Canterbury and Hawke’s Bay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Government gets its way, one million hectares of land will be under irrigation by 2025. That’s the equivalent of sixteen Lake Taupo’s. Water pollution will be inevitable as a result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s paying for these dams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You! Despite the risks and downsides of large-scale irrigation, the Government is throwing &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1603/S00426/funding-for-irrigation-unlocks-potential.htm"&gt;over half a billion taxpayer dollars&lt;/a&gt; at it, and local councils are pouring in &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/301334/dam%27s-cost-jumps-to-more-than-%24900m"&gt;millions of dollars of ratepayers’ money&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s a case of public money being used to help a select few and boost big industrial dairy, while ordinary New Zealanders and our environment pay the price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To protect our rivers, water and reputation and create sustainable livelihoods for farmers and their families, we need to say no to industrial scale irrigation schemes, propped up with public money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE ACTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://grnpc.org/IgNns"&gt;Sign the petition to stop Government funded river pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We sometimes get questions about how Greenpeace New Zealand is governed, so here is an explanation of how it works:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box middle-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/image/2006/12/02112524-21-december-2005-3.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_Property3_ctl00_ctl02_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/Medium/Global/new-zealand/image/2006/12/02112524-21-december-2005-3.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace encounter Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean and attempt to disrupt the whaling operation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Greenpeace's key strengths is its ability to work across borders, while running its national offices and campaigns in a way that is relevant and appropriate to the local context. Our governance structure has been critical to Greenpeace's success as a global campaigning organisation, and to Greenpeace's success in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Executive Director and other senior managers at GPNZ will work collaboratively with GPI, and with their counterparts in other Greenpeace offices, to develop and implement global strategies and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GPNZ is an autonomous organisation, its campaigns, fundraising and administration must align with the framework and policies agreed by the organisation globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board is elected by the Voting Assembly, a group comprised of 35 supporters from Greenpeace NZ's supporter base, five staff from other Greenpeace offices (or GPI) and 10 former Greenpeace NZ staff who have left for more than a year.&lt;br&gt;The Board is comprised of six directors, who are elected at the Annual General Meeting, each for a term of three years. They ensure that the organisation is being managed in an effective and ethical manner, in accordance with Greenpeace's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPNZ Executive Director is responsible for overall management of the organisation. He reports to, and is hired by, the GPNZ Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Incorporated (GPNZ) is an independent, not for profit organisation which is affiliated with Greenpeace International (GPI), based in the Netherlands) and 28 other Greenpeace offices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 4px 6px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/Russel%20GP.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="186"&gt;Russel Norman - Executive Director&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russel is one of New Zealand’s leading voices on sustainability. He has been Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand since November 2015. Before that he was an MP and co-leader of the Green Party. Russel was born in Brisbane and was involved in a wide range of social and environmental campaigns in Australia before moving to New Zealand in 1997. Since then he has continued to agitate for a greener world. He lives in Auckland with his partner and three young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 6px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/Wendy%20p_photo%202015.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"&gt;Wendy Reid - Chair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendy has 15 years senior management experience across the New Zealand public sectors of Health, Welfare and Housing.  Wendy is currently the Executive Director, of the Charitable Trust - Sustainable Aotearoa New Zealand Inc. (www.earthslimits.org).   Wendy was previously on the Board of the Council for Socially Responsible Investment and a member of the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO Education Sub Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px 6px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/20140529_111123.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="177"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stephanie Mills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie currently works as the director of campaigns for NZEI Te Riu Roa, the primary and early childhood teachers' union. Stephanie worked for Greenpeace both internationally and here in Aotearoa for 13 years, in her time with Greenpeace she worked to end nuclear testing and the plutonium trade, to protect the Tarawera river from toxic pollution by the pulp and paper industry, to protect whales and southern bluefin tuna and to protect the climate by closing down polluting power stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 4px 6px; float: right;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/Aroha2.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="186"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: right;"&gt;Aroha Te Pareake Mead  (Ngāti Awa and Ngāti Porou)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aroha is the Global Chair of the IUCN Commission on Environment, Economics and Social Policy (since 2008) and is also on the Governing Council of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (since 2000).

He has worked on campaigning and communications at the UN climate talks since 2011. David also sits on several charities’ boards – and has co-founded three charities: P3 Foundation, the Aotearoa New Zealand Human Rights Lawyers Association (HRLA), and the Aotearoa Youth Leadership Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: right;"&gt;Melanie Rands - Deputy Chair&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 4px 6px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/Melanie%20Rands.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="206"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	Greenpeace is warning of possible backdoor taxpayer funding for big irrigation schemes.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“That would be terrible news for New Zealand’s already polluted rivers,” says campaigner Gen Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new Government has revealed that the Crown Irrigation Fund will be scrapped, which is great news, she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“However there are indications another pot of cash could possibly be used to underwrite big irrigation and expand intensive dairying.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the NZ first labour coalition agreement includes a one billion dollar regional development fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The irrigation lobby has already put its hands out for the new fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Until the government rules out funding irrigation from all taxpayer sources our rivers are still threatened from big irrigation and more cows.“&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Ditching the irrigation fund is a great first step by the new Government to protect New Zealand’s freshwater,” says Greenpeace sustainable agriculture campaigner, Genevieve Toop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Big irrigation schemes mean more cows, and more cows means more pollution in our already stressed rivers ”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The 480 million dollar fund that is set to be wound down was earmarked for Big Irrigation projects around the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “If the regional development fund is used for irrigation this would break the new Government’s commitment of winding down irrigation funding.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; More than 100,000 people have signed the petition calling on the Government to scrap the public funds for big irrigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is one of the seven steps of the &lt;a href="https://www.freshwaterrescueplan.org/"&gt;Freshwater Rescue Plan, &lt;/a&gt;which is supported by sixteen organisations across the health, conservation, tourism and environment and recreation sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There’s been a groundswell of local campaigns and peaceful protests against the proposed schemes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The most high profile irrigation scheme was the Ruataniwha Dam in Hawke’s Bay which was mothballed due to massive national and local opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have campaigned to save our rivers from big irrigation schemes. Today’s announcement shows that this kind of public momentum cannot be ignored and will continue if irrigation is funded through other means”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Toop says they would like to see the new regional development fund spent on supporting the transition from intensive dairying to more regenerative models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people are waking up to the fact that nuclear weapons do not discriminate between civilians and military personnel; they cause environmental devastation and genetic damage that affects future generations. For these and other reasons the threat or use of nuclear weapons was declared illegal by the International Court of Justice in 1996. The World Court also found that there was a solemn obligation to start - and bring to a conclusion - negotiations that would result in nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International cooperation to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction has a proven track record. The use of both chemical and biological weapons has been outlawed and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992) and the Biological Weapons Convention (1975) oversee their elimination. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Africa and South Korea have forsaken their nuclear ambitions. And Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine inherited nuclear weapons after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but rejected them, choosing instead a new identity as independent non-nuclear weapon states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is working for a world free of nuclear weapons, with each region of the world a nuclear free zone. Region by region these zones will rid entire parts of the world of nuclear weapons and shrink the geographical space in which they can play a role. These zones of safety and security also build cooperation and trust amongst peoples and nations. More than 50% of the world is already in nuclear weapons free zones; we need to support those we have and build more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also working to support and build upon international disarmament frameworks such as the NPT. Almost all countries in the world are members of this Treaty and it remains the only legally binding commitment we have from the five declared nuclear weapons states to disarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;Make no mistake - nuclear weapons are still a problem today. Although some may consider them an unfortunate relic from the Cold War, the truth is that the nuclear weapons states are clinging to them as hard as they can, reinventing new roles and designs for them, and recently even proposals for "smaller useable" weapons. And all this despite plenty of speeches, promises and legally binding treaties to get rid of them!&lt;/h3&gt;

            One of 1500 demonstrators, a quarter of the population of Raratonga, who turned out to protest French nuclear testing in 1995.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a small nuclear explosion, any nuclear explosion will have catastrophic consequences for all living things on the planet. The existence and spread of nuclear weapons stands in theway of any real possibilities for true safety, security and peace. Theonly solution is to abolish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years the threat has become even more unpredictable as the nuclear weapon states - the US,the UK, France, Russia and China - have failed to follow their promises made in the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/international-solutions/npt/"&gt; Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; to disarm. Countries like Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have also joined the nuclear weapons club. And due to the widespread use of nuclear energy, about 40 other countries have access to nuclear weapons material and therefore possess the ability to develop nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International community as a whole and several key states in particular, must grapple with need to resolve the contradiction at the heart of the nuclear &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/peace/solutions/international-solutions/npt/"&gt; Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;which some claim means nuclear energy is an "inalienable right". The"inalienable right" to nuclear energy is a historical and political mistake; the real legitimate right is to clean and safe energy and nuclear energy is neither. The world has witnessed the acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities through so-called peaceful civilian nuclear programmes in India, North Korea and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is hope, some countries have lead the way by getting rid of their weapons. South Africa had nuclear weapons in the 1970s but chose the benefits of disarmament, joining the international community as a country that valued cooperation rather than violence. Once the decision is made, disarmament can happen quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless leaders of nuclear weapons states follow South Africa's example and begin to dismantle their arsenals, the political leaders in the aspiring nuclear weapons states are unlikely to either. Obviously the more leaders with fingers on the button, the more likely one of them will trigger a nuclear war, by accident or design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every case, politicians and military leaders have pursued nuclear weapons without democratic debate in their country. Public opinion polls conducted in nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states show large majorities favouring the abolition of nuclear weapons, and every year at the United Nations when all governments vote, we see the vast majority of the 191 countries voting for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Citizens in nuclear weapons states should question why their leaders feel so entitled to gamble with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the Government to use the Regional Development Fund to back up its promises of a just transition to clean energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says the fund provides a prime opportunity for the Government to "walk the talk" on New Zealand’s transition to 100% renewable energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the regional development fund are due to be announced today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has consistently said that it is a Government priority to ensure a just transition for those communities and workers currently reliant on the fossil fuel industry," Larsson says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If the Government really is committed to creating a clean energy economy, then its top priority should be planning and funding a transition away from dependence on oil, gas, and coal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"With $1 billion a year set aside for regional development, now is exactly the moment to start investing in good jobs and sustainable economic development opportunities for the regions that are most dependent on fossil fuels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says this means focusing on fossil-fuel dependant areas such as Taranaki, the West Coast, and Huntly, to ensure those communities are fully supported with finding alternative opportunities in sustainable industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In countries like the US, every dollar invested in clean energy industries now creates more jobs than fossil fuels - it’s a better investment for both workers and the climate," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A clean energy economy would create new jobs in the installation and maintenance of solar panels, the construction of geothermal and wind power plants, energy efficiency retrofits for homes and business, as well as the construction of a better rail network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research and modelling commissioned by Greenpeace found that the clean energy industry could create 25,000 new jobs in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There are enormous opportunities for New Zealanders in the booming clean energy industry. But it will take Government leadership to make them a reality."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson emphasised that the transition of our society away from fossil fuels towards greater clean energy use must mean winding down existing fossil fuel industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Issuing new exploration permits, extending or opening new mines, or building new oil, gas and coal infrastructure equates to expansion of fossil fuel industries and is contrary to the aim of creating a just transition."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the new Government to discount gas expansion in the future of New Zealand’s energy make up following statements by Regional Development Minister, Shane Jones.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Jones announced the appointment of former head of NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas, Rodger Findlay, as chairman of an advisory panel to the Government’s $1 billion a year Regional Development Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jones met the ire of Green Ministers over selecting someone with such a long history in fossil fuels. When defending the decision, Jones stated he believes gas will be an important part of New Zealand’s journey to meet climate change obligations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says it’s a concern that Government Ministers appear to be adopting the oil industry’s "flawed" position that gas is a way to transition to clean energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We can replace all fossil fuels with renewable energy and we have a responsibility to do so urgently if we want to avoid extremely dangerous climate change," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The idea that we should replace coal with gas is a convenient narrative for the oil and gas industry, which is struggling to justify its existence in the face of booming support for clean energy and growing public opposition to fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In the real world, renewable energy like solar, wind, and storage are the smartest options. We have the technology, and it will save us money and create thousands of jobs. We don’t need to rely on dirty energy like gas or coal."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has called on the Government to use the Regional Development Fund to back up its promises of a just transition to clean energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says the fund provides a prime opportunity for the Government to "walk the talk" on New Zealand’s transition to 100% renewable energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has consistently said that it is a Government priority to ensure a just transition for those communities and workers currently reliant on the fossil fuel industry," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If the Government really is committed to creating a clean energy economy, then its top priority should be planning and funding a transition away from dependence on oil, gas, and coal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"With $1 billion a year set aside for regional development, now is exactly the moment to start investing in good jobs and sustainable economic development opportunities for the regions that are most dependent on fossil fuels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larsson says this means focusing on fossil-fuel dependent areas such as Taranaki, the West Coast, and Huntly, to ensure those communities are fully supported with finding alternative opportunities in sustainable industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A clean energy economy would create new jobs in the installation and maintenance of solar panels, the construction of geothermal and wind power plants, energy efficiency retrofits for homes and business, as well as the construction of a better rail network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research and modelling commissioned by Greenpeace found that the clean energy industry could create 25,000 new jobs in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There are enormous opportunities for New Zealanders in the booming clean energy industry.

	Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director, Russel Norman, says the new Government’s Climate Commission needs to be given teeth if it’s to have any significant impact on reducing emissions.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He says the Commission should be able to influence the price on carbon in the same way the Reserve Bank can influence the price of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman’s comments follow the release of the first report by new Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Simon Upton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the report, A Zero Carbon Act for New Zealand, Upton adds his support for a UK-style independent Climate Commission and a Zero Carbon Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Labour-led Government has committed to net zero emissions in New Zealand by 2050, and is in the process of setting up an independent Climate Commission to oversee that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upton has given nine recommendations on the formation of the legislation, including setting effective carbon budgets, establishing a credible Commission, and ensuring that words are turned into action. He also emphasises the importance of addressing climate adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s Norman says that while these are all worthy things, for the Commission to be truly effective it must also have the power to influence the price of carbon by changing the settings of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Currently the suggestion is that the Commission will advise the Government if it is not meeting the milestones needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050, and the Government will then have a window of opportunity to provide a response," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But for this Commission to actually reduce New Zealand’s emissions, we need it to be more than just talk and have some teeth. The time for a new climate talk shop has passed - the Commission needs the power to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Reserve Bank has the power to alter the official cash rate and require minimum deposits on housing loans to counter inflation and threats to fiscal stability. The Climate Commission should be able to act on the greatest threat to humanity - climate change - by adjusting the price of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In practice what this could look like is if we’re not meeting certain milestones then the Commission could adjust the ETS’ settings, for example to accelerate the entry of agriculture, change the ratio of ETS credits needed per tonne of emissions, or change the exposure to the international carbon market. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says as a Pacific Island country on the frontlines of climate change, New Zealand needs to be acting faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just today we’ve seen there is yet another cyclone forming that could hit our Pacific Island neighbours, before heading our way. The Pacific community has only just recovered from Cyclone Gita, and before that, Cyclone Fehi."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as giving the new Climate Commission teeth, Norman says a serious response to climate change would require the Government to shut down any new oil, gas, and coal exploration or extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The world can’t afford to burn the majority of the fossil fuel reserves already discovered if we want to avoid extremely dangerous climate change - searching for more makes no sense," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Likewise we need to bring agriculture into the ETS urgently. We need to deal with our biggest emitters and start developing a just transition for those communities and workers affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have the ability and the resources to create a world-leading clean energy economy in New Zealand. Now we just need to get on with it and do it."&lt;/p&gt;

	In a move that has stunned environmentalists, Genesis Energy has announced a plan to keep burning coal for power generation until 2030.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Genesis Energy had previously promised to turn off its coal-fired units this year, however after a series of closed-door meetings with power companies including Meridian Energy, the deadline was extended. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace climate campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says continuing to burn coal at Huntly Power Station for another 12 years demonstrates a company out of touch with the times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The fact that Genesis Energy, one of New Zealand’s largest electricity generators, is celebrating this plan as a positive step forward for the climate is farcical and misleading," she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The UK has nearly 30 times the scale of New Zealand’s coal-fired infrastructure and has committed to closing all its coal power stations by 2025. If Genesis is still burning coal at Huntly by 2029, that would mean holding our country back from the clean energy future we deserve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "According to the Electricity Authority, over 3GW of renewable power generation already have resource consents in place, but are not being built. Keeping these dirty power stations running is preventing important investments in clean energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "We have the technology and resources to power New Zealand without coal, gas, or any other dirty fossil fuels. What’s lacking is leadership from the industry and Government." This summer, coal-burning at Huntly reached a two-year high. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Larsson says this means New Zealand was belching the dirty fuel during some of the hottest and sunniest days, which could have been instead harnessed for solar energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "This is 2018, and coal is the dirtiest fuel on the planet. We’ve got to be more ambitious when it comes to tackling climate change. Over the past year in New Zealand we’ve experienced a series of extreme storms, floods, droughts and fires," she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Real ambition on climate change means Jacinda Ardern’s Government legislating to stop electricity generators burning coal by 2020, ending the search for new oil, and putting an immediate moratorium on new gas generation." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is also calling on the Government to boost investment in clean wind and solar energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "We need to make it easier for households and communities to produce their own clean, solar energy, and ensure that they are being fairly compensated for adding new, clean energy to the grid," says Larsson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ENDS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more info Sophie Schroder, Greenpeace NZ communications &amp;amp; media, 021 086 47450 Amanda Larsson, Greenpeace NZ climate campaigner, 021 722 794 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary causes of forest loss and degradation vary from region to region. They include agricultural expansion, mining , settlement, shifting agriculture, plantation establishment and infrastructural development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, recent research by the Washington based World Resources Institute (WRI) concludes that "commercial logging poses by far the greatest danger to frontier forests ... affecting more than 70 percent of the world's threatened frontiers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There now exists considerable evidence to show that industrial logging is another key factor in opening up previously unlogged forest to many secondary effects, such as large-scale hunting, illegal trade in bushmeat - including meat from apes, fuel-wood gathering and clearing for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While logging is one of the most important causes of forest loss and degradation, the way the logging industry operates also exacerbates the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned tree cutting and inefficient processing leads to an enormous wastage of wood, while lack of transparency within the industry makes it very difficult to trace the exact source of wood supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;This makes it impossible to determine how well the forest from which it came is managed, leaving the industry open to widespread irresponsible and illegal practices worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

	Images of Sam Neill chowing down on a plastic bag are doing the rounds on social media.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They’re from a new Greenpeace film made with Neill, the &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&lt;/em&gt; star. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; View the full &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz/videos/10156110898505775/"&gt;two minute video here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The New Zealand actor who’s about to appear in a new film Peter Rabbit, made the video to highlight the crisis we have with single-use plastic bags getting into the Pacific Ocean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Kiwis go through 1.6 billion plastic bags per year, on average each bag gets used for 12 minutes before it is thrown out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this tongue-in-cheek Greenpeace video Neill praises the "humble plastic bag" for its ability to last at sea, "making an active contribution to marine life." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The plastic bag is a master of disguise," he says in the clip, "turtles mistake them for jellyfish and eat them. How good is that?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Co-starring in the satirical Greenpeace film with Sam Neill is Auckland marine biologist Dan Godoy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; His research revealed that one in three dead turtles that wash up on New Zealand shores have eaten plastic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Godoy describes plastic bags mockingly as "the peak of human innovation". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "They catch on the wind and pass easily through stormwater drains and into the sea." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Godoy and Neill are lending their support to a Greenpeace petition which is aiming to "ban the bag". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sam Neill is urging all Kiwis to get on board with the Greenpeace campaign. "As a New Zealander I’m acutely aware that our beautiful Pacific Ocean is under threat from many sides. Plastics is something we can do something about immediately. " &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After the campaign started in the middle of last year two supermarket chains, Countdown and New World agreed to voluntarily withdraw single use shopping bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "That takes about 700 million plastic bags a year out of the equation," says Greenpeace campaigner Elena Di Palma. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Greenpeace petition has more than 61,000 signatures and is still growing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It’s due to be presented to Eugenie Sage, Minister of Conservation and Associate Minister for the Environment outside Parliament at 12.30pm on Tuesday February 27th - an event organised by Greenpeace and the Jane Goodall Institute New Zealand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The petition will be accompanied by an open letter signed by key organisations which outlines the case for a regulatory ban on single-use plastic bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The aim is to ban single-use plastic bags which Di Palma says "will protect marine life and create a level playing field for all retailers" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "We can’t stop there," she says. "We really need to get single use plastic out of our lives. Plastic bottles, straws, plastic cutlery, all have a terrible impact on our environment and are deadly to the creatures we share the seas with." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To make the point, at the end of the film Neill stuffs an entire plastic bag into his mouth, almost gagging in the process. Please do not try this at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;FACTSHEET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Scientists estimate that around 8 million tonnes of plastic waste is ending up in the oceans each year.New Zealanders use 1.6 billion plastic bags per year, yet on average each bag is only used for just 12 minutes before it is thrown out and ends up as waste. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -Successful public pressure has led to Countdown and New World committing to stop using single-use plastic bags, reducing the number of bags used in New Zealand by approximately 700 million. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -New Zealand’s turtles are mistaking plastic bags floating in our oceans for jellyfish. A staggering 1 in 3 turtles found dead on New Zealand’s beaches have swallowed plastic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -A whopping 87% of New Zealanders agree that we have too much plastics in our lives. Our petition has now gathered over 61,000 signatures calling for a ban on single-use plastic shopping bags, showing widespread support from the public for legislation on this issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contacts: Elena di Palma +64 21 316 259 Phil Vine +64 21 809 422 ENDS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more information contact: Phil Vine | Communications and Media, Greenpeace Email: &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/new-zealand/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/2ce77754b284491d7a69108b8d2ed6b2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	22/5/12 Auckland: Greenpeace New Zealand is urging the Government here to follow the UK Government’s lead in stimulating green growth, ahead of Thursday’s budget.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If Bill English fails to include such measures, he will have missed yet another opportunity to capitalise on green growth opportunities, says Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, more money is now being invested in clean energy generation (1), than that generated by fossil fuels, with over a trillion US dollars having been spent since 2004 (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bill English’s comments so far have indicated that he has failed to embed the green economy into his economic plans, in favour of deep sea oil, coal mining, and road building,” says Nathan Argent, Greenpeace New Zealand’s Chief Policy Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This appears to be the Government’s only economic strategy - to ignore the value of our clean green reputation, and instead open this country up to those companies who will simply dig, drill and run,” says Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the National Government has spent millions on seismic surveys intended to draw oil companies to New Zealand, there has been barely any money spent on developing the export potential of the cleantech sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Such is the Government’s obsession with coal and oil, you can be reasonably sure that won’t change after Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government talks about the need to be frugal. But in spite of – or in fact, because of – the economy being so tight in the UK, David Cameron’s Government is funding a green investment bank, as a means of kick-starting the economy there,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Government’s Environment Audit Committee concluded that: “There would be environmental, energy security and economic benefits from making a transition to a green economy. Putting the environment at the centre of the economy would help achieve sustainable use of natural resources. There are clear benefits of acting now, with the costs of inaction far greater if we wait. Expenditure involved in making the transition to a green economy would be an investment, not simply a cost (3).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argent says: “If our Government was to follow David Cameron’s lead, we could reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices; revitalise our manufacturing based in low carbon sectors; modernise our infrastructure; reduce domestic and commercial utility bills, and create green-collar jobs,” Argent says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, we’d be building a safer, more sustainable and smarter future for New Zealand.”  &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the Government to cancel all new offshore oil drilling tenders and permits that have been granted by Crown Minerals to new offshore oil exploration by international oil companies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The call comes in light of the admission today by Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, that there is not an adequate environmental and health and safety regulatory regime in place to allow the Government's planned expansion of offshore oil exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The review of health, safety and environmental legislation for offshore petroleum operations by the Ministry of Economic Development comes after permits have been granted to major oil companies; including the Brazilian oil company Petrobras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Gerry Brownlee is trying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted - he has given permits without the correct regulations being in place. This is bad governance and now calls into question whether the regulatory review can be conducted honestly given that international oil companies will be lobbying for the weakest standards possible to protect profits," says Greenpeace New Zealand Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MED report states in its executive summary that "given the planned expansion of offshore petroleum activity; the demonstrated unpredictability of accidents; and the need for a responsible precautionary approach to health, safety and environmental issues, there is little room for complacency about the current regime".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"That’s official speak for ‘the Government is being totally reckless,’ says Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As the world is running out of easy-to-access oil, the oil industry is looking for countries with a lackadaisical approach to environmental standards, where it can open up new frontiers in its search for the hard-to-reach stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Gerry Brownlee is trying to position New Zealand as one of those places. But the harder the oil is to reach, the higher the risk of a spill, as the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The ocean in parts of exploration zones the New Zealand Government is opening up is deeper than the water the Deepwater Horizon was operating in when it lost control of its test well, which means the chances of a Gulf of Mexico-type spill happening here will be high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"At any rate, burning fossil fuels will only bring us closer to the point where we trigger a state of runaway climate change … a point to which we are already frighteningly close," says Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If the Minister is genuinely committed to long term economic prosperity, he should be backing those home-grown businesses that are developing world-class clean technologies and moving New Zealand towards a cleaner, more sustainable future," Boxer says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Helen Clark, Dr Jane Goodall and actor Sam Neill are among the growing list asking the New Zealand Government for a total ban on single-use plastic bags.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This Tuesday 27th Feb at midday, the Jane Goodall Institute New Zealand and Greenpeace will be presenting a letter to the Minister of Conservation, Eugenie Sage, in front of the Parliament buildings, asking the New Zealand government for a regulatory ban on single-use plastic bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The letter is signed by former Prime Minister, Right Honourable Helen Clark, in her new position as Patron of JGINZ, and supported by companies, councils, non-governmental and community organisations, including Countdown, Bunnings, the Mayor of Wellington, SPCA, Forest and Bird, World Wildlife Fund, all supporting the government to Ban The Bag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Helen Clark says, “the banning of single-use plastic bags from stores, communities, and the environment would be a big step in the right direction towards achieving the targets of sustainable development goals, a step where we are well behind many other countries which are enacting legislation”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “I hope that the New Zealand Government, supported by corporations, community-based organisations and many New Zealanders, will ban the bag.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Also signed up are: PURE tour 2018 - Plastics Use Resistance Education, the 5 Gyres Institute, Algalita Marine Research &amp;amp; Education, South Pacific and the Te Karu o Te Ika Voyaging Trust &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Accompanying the letter is a petition signed by 65,000 New Zealanders calling on the Government to ban single-use plastic bags, showing the increasing concern about the plague of plastic in our oceans and environments, and the impact it is having. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sam Neill, star of Jurassic Park and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, has got together with Greenpeace and made a tongue in cheek film in praise of “the humble plastic bag”. The video has been viewed more than 700,000 times in the four days since launch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; New Zealand currently ranks among the worst in the world for creating urban waste and has fallen behind many countries in instituting a ban on single-use plastic bags. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace Campaigner, Elena Di Palma, says New Zealand’s plastic waste problem is quickly spiralling out of control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Kiwis use around 1.6 billion bags per year which are used for an average of only 12 minutes, yet each one can take up to 1,000 years to degrade. They are choking our oceans and marine life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “The aim is to ban all single-use plastic bags - we really need to get single use plastic out of our lives," Di Palma says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Plastic bottles, straws, plastic cutlery, all have a terrible impact on our environment and are deadly to the creatures we share the seas with.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jane Goodall Institute New Zealand CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder Dr Melanie Vivian says “There is an urgent need for all to take responsibility for the impacts we are having on our planet and its inhabitants. The consequences of our conveniences are now starkly obvious. To turn the impacts around behaviour change will need to come from us all, governments, businesses, communities and individuals. What we are seeing on the issue of single-use plastic bags that is so heartening is that so many are saying they are committed to making that change. As such we are ready to support the government to make legislative change to ban the bag. Hopefully the first step in many that we can take together to make positive differences for all”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Jane Goodall Institute New Zealand, Greenpeace and other organisations are asking, and supporting, the Government to take decisive action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Petition Delivery starts at 12pm at Parliament Steps on Tuesday the 27th of February. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Facts about single use plastic in New Zealand &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 87% of New Zealanders agree that we have too much plastics in our lives. Our petition has now gathered over 65,000 signatures calling for a ban on single-use plastic shopping bags, showing widespread support from the public for legislation on this issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Scientists estimate that around 8 million tonnes of plastic waste is ending up in the oceans each year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; New Zealanders use 1.6 billion plastic bags per year, yet on average each bag is only used for just 12 minutes before it is thrown out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; New Zealand’s turtles are mistaking plastic bags floating in our oceans for jellyfish.

	The global tuna industry is undergoing a period of rapid transformation. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Driven by the urgent need to protect tuna stocks from overfishing or to  help rebuild damaged populations, and in response to growing global  consumer demand for sustainable seafood, progressive tuna companies are  fast adapting their fishing and supply chains to ensure they can meet  new standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Around the globe, some of the biggest  international tuna industry businesses, including leading brands and  major retailers, are making commitments to phase out the use of  destructive Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) when used in purse seine  fisheries, and are actively supporting the designation of the Pacific  Commons as marine reserves by agreeing not to sell tuna sourced from  these locations. Momentum towards sustainability is also starting to  build through the longline tuna supply chain, where urgent and  far-reaching reform is needed to clean up this highly unregulated  sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This report documents some of the changes  being made by leading brands and retailers around the world to build and  secure sustainable supplies of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the global tuna industry transforms, the question  is not 'who will be the next company to change?' but 'which businesses  will lose out by acting too slowly?'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Oliver Knowles, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	Auckland 4 December 2011: A new report released today by Greenpeace New Zealand reveals that the 1.4 million tonnes of palm kernel expeller (PKE) imported into New Zealand during the 2010/2011 dairy season, could have produced up to 8.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (1). This is the equivalent to 12 per cent of New Zealand's entire annual greenhouse gas emissions.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Carbon Cost of Palm Kernel Expeller from Malaysia and Indonesia is the first comprehensive report produced on the carbon footprint created by PKE. It was written by independent scientist Dr Rob Carlton, who specialises in calculating carbon footprints. It was also peer-reviewed by Professor Pete Smith, a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and a world-leading expert on soil carbon emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As 90 per cent of imported PKE goes to the dairy sector, and 95 per cent of dairy farms are owned by Fonterra, the report makes it clear that Fonterra's use of PKE - which has increased exponentially since 2005 - is likely to be having a significant effect on the carbon footprint of its milk products. New Zealand currently buys over a third of global PKE stocks (2). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report comes at a time when New Zealand's key export markets are taking the issue of PKE very seriously, because of the palm products industry's climate impacts. A recent UK Government report highlighted the use of PKE for animal feed as an area needing urgent attention, due to its links to deforestation (3). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is part of a trend for retailers overseas to demand more sustainable, climate-friendly goods. In 2009, the major UK supermarket chain Tesco became the first retailer to label the carbon footprint of milk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The UK Government is clearly taking the environmental impact of using PKE seriously, and now this report, which demonstrates the high carbon cost of PKE, means that there is nowhere left for Fonterra to hide. The game is up," says GPNZ Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This report also shows that John Key's effort to defend the use of PKE is out of step with the science, and the views of our key export markets (4). It is time the New Zealand Government followed the lead of the UK Government and acted to protect our economy, and the climate (5)," Argent says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The huge carbon footprint of palm kernel comes from the well-documented destruction of both rainforests and carbon rich peatlands in Indonesia and Malaysia by the palm industry, as it expands to meet the global demand for PKE, along with its co-products crude palm oil, and palm kernel oil. These forests and peatlands are vital in storing greenhouse gases that, when released, help drive climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The destruction of Indonesia's forests and peatlands also has a devastating impact on biodiversity. The endangered orang-utan and the Sumatran tiger are just two of the species under threat of extinction due to the loss of natural forest habitat. The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species classifies the Borneo orang-utan as endangered, with estimates indicating that there are between 45,000 and 65,000 left in the wild. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"New Zealand has a choice - we can get a reputation for industrial dairying that destroys orang-utan habitat and drives climate change, or become world leaders in low carbon dairying," Argent concludes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fonterra produced a report into the carbon footprint of its products in 2009, based on its 2004-2005 operations. A copy of the report was eventually released to Greenpeace New Zealand under the Official Information Act, but with almost all input data and results blanked out. As such it is not clear how Fonterra calculated the climate impact of the PKE it uses. Parts of Fonterra's report suggest that no climate impacts were attributed to PKE. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PKE imports to New Zealand have increased eleven fold since 2005 - with almost all of those imports being used by the dairy sector. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has been working to get Fonterra to stop using PKE since 2009. Greenpeace New Zealand has twice sent teams into Indonesia to document the destruction caused by the currently unsustainable palm industry. Greenpeace NZ activists have also carried out actions against PKE shipments three times, the last in February 2011 in New Plymouth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/The-carbon-cost-of-palm-kernel-expeller/"&gt;The report can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For interviews, call Nathan Argent, Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner, on 021 971 234. To arrange an interview with Dr Rob Carlton, call Jay Harkness, GPNZ Media and Communications, on 021 495 216.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTES:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1)    The report estimated that 2010/11's PKE imports were responsible for up to 8.91 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Assuming 77 % (90% x 86%) of the carbon emissions are spread across the total New Zealand milk production (16,000 million litres) this represents GHG emissions associated with PKE between 38 and 70 g CO2-e per litre  of fresh milk.  The corresponding emissions, calculated using mass allocation, are 232 to 433 g CO2-e per litre of fresh milk. The use of PKE is, therefore, likely to represent a significant source of unaccounted GHG emissions in this sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2)    New Zealand imported over 1.4 million tonnes of palm kernel in the 2010/2011 seasonal year (Statistics New Zealand), which is over a third of the global trade (which stands at 4.86 million tonnes, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3)    Review of Policy Options Relating to Sustainable Palm Oil Procurement, a report prepared by Proforest for the UK Government's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, March, 2011, says: "The supply chain study also highlighted the large volumes of palm kernel meal being imported for the animal feed sector. To date, this sector has not been subject to the same level of market interest or pressure for sustainably sourced product, and therefore offers the potential for significant gains in sustainable sourcing through targeted awareness-raising and support."&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=EV0459_10153_FRP.pdf"&gt;http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=EV0459_10153_FRP.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) John Key, TVNZ, September 17, 2009, regarding PKE: "It's a waste product, in my opinion it's not leading to deforestation and on that basis I have no intention of intervening."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) United Nations Environment Programme UNEP (2007) 'The Last Stand of the Orangutan', UNEP, January 2007 www.unep.org/ grasp/docs/2007Jan-LastStand-of-Orangutan-report.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace International document released this evening exposes the catastrophic environmental impacts of industrial meat and dairy farming.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is in. The world is waking up to the fact that industrial livestock farming is warming the planet, contaminating our rivers, tearing down our forests, and putting our health at risk." says Gen Toop, Greenpeace’s sustainable agriculture campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Polluting industrial farming practices are coming under increasing scrutiny by our international customers. If this is ignored, warns Greenpeace, the imminent consumer shift away from industrial meat and dairy products could present a major threat to our economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, the report says agriculture is projected to produce more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, 70% of which will come from industrial livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands the livestock farming is responsible for 14 percent of global climate change emissions. As much as all trains, ships, planes and cars put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial livestock farming is also a leading cause of deforestation and water contamination worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace in New Zealand has been campaigning against the industrial farming practices that have taken hold here. These include intensive stocking, the heavy use of big irrigation, synthetic fertilisers, toxic agri-chemicals and imported animal feed. " says Toop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we also have a growing number of meat and dairy farmers in New Zealand  that have reduced their herds and turned their backs on industrial practices - using regenerative farming to work with the environment rather than to its detriment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This report puts those progressive, regenerative farmers in a prime position to take advantage of this new global playing field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line of Greenpeace’s ambitious international campaign aims to halve the world production of meat and dairy by 2050 and put an end to polluting industrial farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes off the back off a growing global chorus calling for a cut in the production and consumption of meat and dairy. The UN Environmental Group, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Wildlife Fund have already made this call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The inevitable consumer shift towards less and better meat and dairy is a chance for our Government to unshackle NZ’s economy from its unhealthy dependence on dirty intensive dairy farming and bulk low-value milk powder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging New Zealand politicians and farming leaders to seize the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In fact, if we don’t diversify NZ agriculture into more plant-based food production and higher-value meat and dairy grown using truly environmentally sound, regenerative farming methods, we’re going to be left behind."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The contamination of New Zealand’s rivers from industrial dairying has already attracted international media attention from outlets like The Guardian and Al Jazeera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Landcorp the country’s biggest farmer, is one of those seizing the opportunity recently saying "our reality is that we will need fewer animals on our land in the future and more plants," Toop says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This transformation in what we grow and how we grow it won’t happen overnight and farmers will need help from the Government, banks and their leadership to change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can save our rivers, our climate and our forests from destructive industrial livestock farming. The alternative farming methods are there, the markets are there, and the urgency is there. All we need now is the political will to make it happen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NOTES:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The main findings direct GHG emissions from the agriculture sector account for 24% of all global emissions, and livestock emissions (including land-use change) account for 14%, which is comparable to the emissions from the whole transport sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-If left unchecked, agriculture is projected to produce 52% of global greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, 70% of which will come from meat and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The food system is also responsible for 80% of the deforestation currently taking place in some of the most biodiverse forests remaining on Earth, with livestock and animal feed expansion being the most prominent single driver of this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Since 1970, the Earth has lost half of its wildlife but tripled its livestock population. Livestock production now occupies 26% of land on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-This year it is expected that 76 billion animals will be slaughtered to satisfy meat and dairy consumption.Changes in human diets towards more plant based foods could reduce around 20-40% of the projected increase in extinction risk by 2060 for medium- and large-bodied species of birds and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace investigations reveal how krill-fishing companies are expanding operations in the fragile Antarctic ocean, putting an entire food web at risk. What’s more, they are often involved in fishing practices that could damage wildlife and protected ocean areas.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/oceans/2018/Licence%20to%20Krill%20Greenpeace%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 8px;" title="Licence to Krill" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23038c85-licence-to-krill-report.png" alt="Licence to Krill" width="250" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Penguins, whales, seals and more all depend on krill for their survival. But these small, shrimp-like crustaceans are threatened by both climate change and the growth in krill fishing, which has been driven in part by an increased demand for the krill oil found in some health supplements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2010, the krill-fishing industry has grown steadily, with the entry of Norwegian companies and fishing boats, increased catches by South Korean vessels, and the emergence of the Chinese krill-fishing fleet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fishing for Antarctic krill is permitted in the Antarctic Ocean under the management of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The fishery is often referred to as the best-managed in the world, and is focused on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Orkneys and the Bransfield Strait. This closely follows the main krill-foraging areas for penguins, seals and whales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the industry’s attempts to portray itself as one of the world’s most sustainable fisheries, evidence collected by Greenpeace demonstrates a pattern of fishing activity increasingly close to shore and in the immediate vicinity of penguin colonies and whale feeding grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crucially, krill fishing is taking place in areas which have been put forward as ocean sanctuaries. Such protected areas will help these marine ecosystems to build resilience to the combined impacts of climate change, pollution and fishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As well as robbing marine animals of a vital food supply, industrial krill fishing in such pristine waters carries huge environmental risks. Groundings, oil spills and ship accidents such as fires all threaten the wildlife and fragile habitats of the Antarctic Ocean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s investigation also exposes the regular use of transhipping, when a catch is transferred from one vessel to another. Our tracking of krill-fishing vessels shows that they have anchored in protected waters, despite the recommendation that anchoring should be avoided as it can damage animals and structures on the seabed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For these reasons, Greenpeace is calling for krill-fishing companies to restrict all fishing activity in areas under consideration as ocean sanctuaries. We are also calling on krill-buying companies to stop sourcing from vessels that continue to fish in these same areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, we are calling for international collaboration between governments, companies and civil society to create a large-scale network of ocean sanctuaries, including in the Antarctic Ocean, to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, December 12th 2011: This morning 150 original art prints made from a little blue penguin killed by the Rena disaster appeared along Auckland’s Khyber Pass Road. The prints are accompanied by the message ‘Rena did this. Deep sea oil drilling could be a thousand times worse.’
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/climate/2011/oiloncanvas/_E6E3315.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="505"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel said, "This memorial to the 20,000 birds killed by the Rena disaster is also a stark reminder of the dangers of opening up New Zealand waters to deep sea oil drilling."(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little blue penguin was found dead and covered in oil on Matakana Island by Greenpeace volunteers when they were helping the local iwi, Nga Hapu o te Moutere o Matakana, clean oil off their beaches following the Rena spill. A diving petrel was also found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An art collective made up of creatives from Publicis Mojo and Greenpeace volunteers came up with the concept of making ‘oil prints’ with the birds, and donated their time to create hundreds of prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original ‘oil on canvas’ prints will feature at a ‘pop up’ gallery opening at 5pm this evening (Monday 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) at 2 Queen Street, Central Auckland. The gallery will also screen a short film about the making of the bird prints, featuring a soundtrack donated by the band Radiohead. The exhibition will be open daily from 9.30am-5.30pm until Friday December 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impacts of the Rena accident shocked New Zealanders, but in global terms the 350 tonnes spill was relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 the Deepwater Horizon accident leaked 627,000 tonnes of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, while engineers spent months struggling to fix a problem 1.5 kilometres below the sea’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009 the Montara oil rig blowout happened in Western Australia at a depth of only 80 metres. It took two and a half months to get under control. The Australian Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism estimates that the Montara oil leak could have been as high as 2,000 barrels of oil per day; this equates to one Rena-type spill every day for 74 days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undersea pictures and videos taken by experts from the Surabaya Institute of Technology (ITS) in October 2011 revealed that around 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres) of coral reefs in the Sawu Sea had been destroyed by both the Montara spill and chemical substances — including the chemical Corexit 9500 — that were used to submerge the oil in the clean-up efforts. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global oil companies now prospecting in New Zealand waters have been involved in numerous devastating oil spills worldwide, including the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the recent spill off the coast of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has invited oil companies to drill in New Zealand waters at depths of up to 3km (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition to deep sea oil plans are growing. To date over 106,000 kiwis have signed Greenpeace’s petition to stop deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDITOR’S NOTES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A media briefing on the risks of deep sea oil drilling in NZ and an infographic showing the sites that are due to be opened for deep sea drilling are available on the Greenpeace website &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/oilbriefing" target="_blank"&gt;www.greenpeace.org.nz/oilbriefing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150 original penguin prints will be on display along Khyber   Pass Road until Sunday 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pop up gallery will open at 5.00pm on Monday 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December at 2 Queen Street, alongside Britomart. The exhibition will continue until Friday December 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace wish to acknowledge Nga Hapu o te Moutere o Matakana as the iwi with mana whenua over the Matakana beach where the birds were found; the birds will be returned to them in coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Wildlife Response Centre that dealt with the oiled Rena birds estimated that 20,000 birds were killed by the spill, based on US and UK studies which indicate that we only see one to ten per cent of the birds that are killed by an oil spill – the others simply die unseen at sea.  In excess of 2,000 bird carcasses have been recovered. The same is thought to be true of other species. Following the Deepwater Horizon spill, only 101 dead whales were reported in the initial months following the spill. However a recent scientific study estimated that total number of dolphins and whales killed by the spill was approx 5,050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Source references and a map of sites earmarked for oil exploration in New Zealand visit can be found in a Greenpeace media briefing available at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/oilbriefing" target="_blank"&gt;www.greenpeace.org.nz/oilbriefing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has asked the State Services Commission to expand its investigation into the use of Thompson and Clark by a government agency to include Ministry for Business, Innovation &amp; Employment, after OIA requests revealed the Ministry has also worked with the controversial private investigations firm, for years.

	A group of leading New Zealanders, including scientists, health professionals, unions, and the current New Zealand Poet Laureate, have launched an open letter urging Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to end oil and gas exploration.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen notable individuals and associations have so far put their name to the letter, which encourages Ardern and her Government to turn her "passion into action" on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has asked the State Services Commission to expand its investigation into the use of Thompson and Clark by a government agency to include Ministry for Business, Innovation &amp; Employment, after OIA requests revealed the Ministry has also worked with the controversial private investigations firm.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This follows last week’s announcement by the State Services Commission (SSC) that it will be launching an inquiry into crown insurer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Response, for using Thompson and Clark (TCIL) to spy on Christchurch earthquake complainants.  Greenpeace New Zealand’s executive director, Russel Norman, says the investigations methods used by TCIL are a “cancer to democracy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thompson and Clark are known for their Orwellian and oppressive spying on the advocacy groups who are a fundamental part of civil society. Previous governments have warned against using this company for very good reason, and it’s completely inappropriate for tax-payer funded agencies to still be working with them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multitudes of documents received under the Official Information Act (OIA) reveal that the Ministry for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Employment (MBIE) has had a close relationship with TCIL for more than four years, and has worked with them to protect the oil industry and counteract the advocacy work of environmental groups like Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The documents and emails that have been released are a fraction of the full picture - MBIE declined a number of requests for certain correspondence with TCIL on the grounds that over 2,000 documents exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman says there is a clear trail of “teamwork” between TCIL, MBIE, and oil and mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The documents we’ve seen show a highly collegial relationship between MBIE and TCIL that includes references to their drinking sessions and other social personal activities. At times it’s difficult to tell where MBIE ends and TCIL begins in these exchanges,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is clear that MBIE has also been assisting the spy agency to obtain commercial contracts by passing on contact details for mining companies that will be arriving in New Zealand in order for TCIL to pitch their services to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a taxpayer funded Government regulator that we expect to do its job professionally and impartially. Instead, what we’ve seen feels like MBIE has been acting as little more than an agent for oil companies and their contractors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, a reverse sting operation by Greenpeace revealed that TCIL had been spying on staff and volunteers, at times on a daily basis, for years. Staff had been watched, followed to their homes, photographed, and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental organisation sued TCIL for invasion of privacy, and the case is ongoing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Norman says the release of these latest OIA documents show there are even more layers to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We now know that TCIL has been passing information about peaceful climate activists to MBIE during this time. The exact detail is difficult to ascertain from the heavily redacted OIAs, but it’s plainly more than information obtained from public sources,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The methods used by TCIL are a cancer to in our democracy as they primarily target citizens that engage in peaceful advocacy. The chilling effect of being under constant and intrusive surveillance for simply campaigning on important issues such as climate change, fundamentally corrodes what it means to live in a free and democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We look forward to an SSC inquiry into just how deeply this unacceptable behaviour seeps into our public services sector, and we hope that the new Government will act quickly to restore the public’s trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Sealord is ignoring a global trend by canned tuna retailers taking steps to protect tuna stocks from overfishing, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On Monday Italy’s leading canned tuna brand, Mareblu (1), joined a growing list of retailers which will no longer sell tuna caught using purse seine nets set around fish aggregating devices (FADs) - a fishing method which kills other marine life (2). This is the method used by fleets supplying Sealord which is refusing to change its sourcing policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas says the Mareblu commitment to change to more sustainable fishing methods is another important step towards halting the decline in tuna stocks and protecting the marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is now clear that major change is taking place across the global tuna industry. It’s very disappointing that Sealord, New Zealand’s largest canned tuna brand, thinks it knows better and is ignoring this trend,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As more and more businesses abandon the use of destructive FADs and commit to supporting marine reserves, real pressure is growing Sealord and other brands which are refusing to clean up their supplies and provide consumers with the sustainable products they are demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mareblu announcement comes three weeks after a similar shift by US grocery giant Safeway (3). In the UK all the major tuna brands have stopped using, or committed to phase out, FAD-caught tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June last year New Zealand retailer Foodstuffs announced (4) that it would change most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free by the end of 2011 and add a range of tuna caught by pole and line – a lower impact type of fishing. Greenseas, owned by Heinz in Australia, and also sold in New Zealand, has committed to phase out FAD and purse seine caught tuna by 2015 (5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mareblu says that by 2016 all of its tuna will be caught by pole and line or in purse seine nets which do not use FADs. It also says it supports marine reserves and will not source tuna or other fish from the network of areas in the Pacific Ocean known as the Pacific Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning globally to create a more sustainable and equitable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans - necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, says the Charities Board decision not to grant the environmental organisation charity status is unsurprising given that the Board has resolutely opposed Greenpeace’s application all along, in spite of previously losing the battle in the Supreme Court.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In a world facing catastrophic climate change and out of control water pollution, Greenpeace is a necessity, regardless of whether or not these three people on the Charities Board, appointed by the previous Government, agree with our advocacy," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are a proud independent environmental campaigning organisation that doesn’t take money from corporations or governments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We’re an organisation with the sole purpose of serving public interest by advocating for the environment that we’re all part of and depend upon. It speaks volumes about the values of the Charities Board that it believes that advocacy to save the planet from climate destruction doesn’t serve a charitable purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Charities Board case has been a seven-year saga, which has bounced from the High Court, to the Court of Appeal, to the Supreme Court, and then back to the Charities Board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Supreme Court found that the Charities Board had got it wrong by declining Greenpeace’s application, and it directed the Board to reconsider Greenpeace’s application. But then the Charities Board just came up with a new shopping list of reasons for declining the application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Supreme Court held that advocacy could be charitable. This decision today has essentially found that advocating for climate change action and clean rivers is not charitable, so it is hard to see what is acceptable advocacy. This will have a chilling effect right across the charitable sector and a negative impact on the quality of our democracy. Advocacy promoting different points of view is an essential part of of a healthy democracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The new Government will need to look at this decision and this law, and decide whether they need to reform it to encourage democracy and advocacy, rather than discourage it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Like any NGO, we have to make the most of our limited resources and pick our battles. We are reviewing the decision and will decide the next steps in due course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It’s also important to remember that this decision has no impact on our donee status, so any donations will continue to be tax deductible for our supporters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Greenpeace may not be viewed a charity, but it is a necessity. In practice, the Board’s decision doesn’t change anything. We’re going to get on with doing the work that is a vital part of any democratic society: Advocating for our environment, and all of the people and creatures that call this planet home."&lt;/p&gt;

	Friday, January 5: In the case brought against the Norwegian Government by Greenpeace Norway for granting new oil licenses to drill in the Arctic, the Oslo District Court reached a decision yesterday afternoon, Norwegian time. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The legal action is part of a widespread Greenpeace campaign against state-owned Norwegian oil giant Statoil’s oil exploration in the Arctic and in New Zealand waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court found the Norwegian Government not responsible for breaching the Constitution, but that the right to a healthy environment is protected by the Constitution and the Government must uphold those rights. In reaction to the judgment, the head of Greenpeace Norway, Truls Gulowsen, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While it's good news that the judgment acknowledges the Environmental Article in the Norwegian Constitution, it's very disappointing that it neglects Norway’s responsibility for damaging the planet’s climate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are disagreeing with the judgment, as it ignores the Paris agreement and a warming planet demanding action against climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, international oil companies such as Statoil, OMV, Anadarko and Petrobras have faced years of protest by Greenpeace, iwi and local communities as they attempted to find oil here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, Amanda Larsson was disappointed but undeterred by yesterday’s judgment, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This decision doesn’t change the fact that, if we’re to have a future, the oil industry must have no future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larsson says the judgment will only strengthen an already-strong and growing people-powered resistance to fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Across the world, ever more people are taking action to keep climate-polluting fossil fuels in the ground. They know that protecting health, food security, critical infrastructure and endangered wildlife from the ravages of climate change is more important than defending oil company profits,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here in New Zealand, our biggest councils have opposed new oil. Iwi up and down the country have said no to it. Hundreds of thousands of people have marched, signed petitions, and lobbied their local representatives to try and stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern couldn’t have a clearer mandate to end the search for new oil and gas,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/15809/petition/1" target="_blank"&gt;new petition to the Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; has rapidly gained over 28,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition was launched as the world’s largest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior returned to New Zealand to search for oil off the Taranaki Coast. The ship is currently in New Zealand on behalf of OMV, an Austrian oil company that, like Statoil, has drilling operations in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Warrior has been met with significant protest both locally and in Wellington. Recently, a national gathering of Māori leaders came to an historic agreement to oppose all seismic testing and oil exploration in the waters of Aotearoa. The Iwi Chairs Forum passed the resolution to seek amendments to the EEZ Act to give effect to this opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand actor Lucy Lawless recently traveled to the Arctic to confront Statoil on board the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, as the company drilled for oil in one of the world’s last pristine natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling oil industry efforts to put a positive spin on a just-released public perception survey “desperate and misleading”.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ) &lt;a href="http://www.pepanz.com/oil-and-gas-new-zealand/public-opinion-on-oil-and-gas/" target="_blank"&gt;released results of an annual industry reputation survey&lt;/a&gt;, and Greenpeace climate campaigner, Kate Simock, says they’re less than favourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pepanz.com/oil-and-gas-new-zealand/public-opinion-on-oil-and-gas/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/PageFiles/810309/screenshot-6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="447"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re confused about why PEPANZ would want to draw attention to this survey. It shows that an overwhelming number of people don’t trust the oil and gas industry and have an unfavourable view of it. Anyone who took the time to read the results would see that the oil industry is losing its public mandate on almost every point,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way that PEPANZ has publicly portrayed this survey is desperate and misleading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey shows that only 13% of respondents trust the oil and gas industry, while almost half of those surveyed don’t trust them at all, Simcock says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s also amusing to see that PEPANZ, in their media release, have tried to hide the fact that many more people than not feel unfavourably about the oil industry, and have instead tried to put a positive spin on the results, with some of the numbers not adding up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While PEPANZ is boasting publicly that 60% of respondents have either a favourable or neutral view of our industry, closer inspection reveals that what the data actually shows is a quite different truth - just 19% of people actually think of the industry favourably, compared to 32% unfavourably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simcock says a positive from the survey is that participants have a rapidly growing concern about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By far the greatest reason people don’t think favourably about the oil and gas industry is that oil is bad for the environment and increases climate change. The growing awareness of climate issues, even since last year, is significant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t afford to burn most of the fossil fuel reserves we know about if we’re to avoid dangerous climate change. All new oil and gas needs to be left in the ground. New Zealanders are increasingly seeing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Wednesday, January 31: Police have warned climate activists currently locked onto an offshore oil exploration support ship in the Port of Taranaki that officials from the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) are travelling from Wellington to charge them under the 'Anadarko Amendment'.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The controversial 2013 Amendment to the Crown Minerals Act makes it an offence to interfere with oil exploration ships at sea, and was passed under the National Government without public consultation or a Bill of Rights Act review. It was widely criticised by academics, Labour MPs, and activists alike, and seen as an attempt to stifle peaceful environmental protest against the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Amanda Larsson, calls the move "outrageous".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the oil branch of the Government threatening to use the draconian anti-protest laws passed by the last National Government to stop peaceful protest against oil exploration," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s outrageous that under the new Labour-led Government, which has committed to bold climate leadership, the oil ministry would consider punishing climate activists using this anti-democratic law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was bad enough that the previous National Government used these laws against climate activists, but the supposedly climate-friendly new Labour Government shouldn’t be threatening climate activists with $50,000 fines and 12 months in jail for protesting the oil industry."'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time it was passed in 2013, Labour and the Greens strongly opposed the law. Many prominent New Zealanders condemned the amendment, including Dame Anne Salmond and former Labour Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Geoffrey Palmer QC, and other lawyers including the late Sir Peter Williams QC (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With their commitment to climate action, the new Labour Government need to act now to reign in the Ministry of Oil, and more importantly, stop offshore exploration and drilling to fulfill our obligations to tackle climate change. We can’t afford to burn most of the known fossil fuel reserves if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change - searching for more makes no sense," says Larsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As well as stopping offshore oil exploration, the Ardern Government should repeal the Anadarko Amendment and protect the right to peacefully protest in a democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These activists have put their bodies on the line to protect our future and our children’s future. If we are serious about tackling climate change, we need to urgently end oil exploration and stop pandering to the oil industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April last year, Greenpeace activists, including Executive Director Dr Russel Norman, swam in front of the Amazon Warrior, 60 nautical miles off the Wairarapa coast, stopping it from seismic blasting for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists and Greenpeace were charged for the first time in New Zealand history by MBIE under the Anadarko Amendment. They face a year in jail and up to $300,000 in collective fines. They have pleaded Not Guilty and will face trial in April.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Minister of Energy and Resources, Megan Woods, will accept a Greenpeace petition at midday today signed by more than 45,000 people calling for an end to oil exploration.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The event on Parliament Lawn will include representatives from Forest and Bird, WWF, Oil Free Wellington, OraTaiao (New Zealand Climate &amp;amp; Health Council), as well as Greenpeace Executive Director Russel Norman, and actor Lucy Lawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It will feature four &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/MakeOilHistory"&gt;large signs&lt;/a&gt; that depict historic stances taken by previous Labour leaders and call on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to make history by ending oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is the latest in a series of recent activities throughout the country urging the new Government to take action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the lead-up to the election, Ardern was widely praised for stating that climate change is the nuclear free moment of her generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner, Kate Simcock, says the Prime Minister must now turn those words into tangible action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The world can’t afford to burn even existing fossil fuel reserves let alone seek out new oil and gas if we want to avoid catastrophic warming,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Searching for new oil or gas is senseless, and we’re asking the Jacinda Ardern Government to put an end to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last week, an &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.nz/pm-open-letter"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by more than 60 notable individuals and associations including scientists, health professionals, iwi leaders, unions, businesspeople, journalists, poets, actors and musicians, was launched to encourage Ardern and her Government to turn “passion into action” on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dame Jane Campion, New Zealander of the Year Taika Waititi, climate change Professor James Renwick, Victoria University’s Vice Chancellor Grant Guilford, Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull, Poet Laureate Selina Tusitala Marsh and actor Lucy Lawless are among the signatories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Campion, a world-leading screenwriter, producer, and director, says tackling climate change is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“For me, supporting my Prime Minister’s aim to move strongly and decisively to address climate change is a clear necessity; I want my daughter and all others to inherit a viable planet. Nothing on this earth is more important,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Iwi and hapū up and down the country have expressed a longstanding opposition to oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most recently, a national gathering of Māori leaders came to an historic agreement to oppose all seismic testing and oil exploration in the waters of New Zealand. The Iwi Chairs Forum passed the resolution to seek amendments to the EEZ Act to give effect to this opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The biggest councils in New Zealand have also opposed oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Auckland City Council, Environment Canterbury, Christchurch City Council, Dunedin City Council, Kaikoura District Council, and Gisborne District Council are among those that have formally opposed the annual Block Offer process implemented by the previous National Government, which sees vast tracts of New Zealand’s land and sea offered to oil and gas companies for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new Jacinda Ardern Government has not yet announced whether or not it will continue with this annual process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Greenpeace event comes a day before another petition hand in by Coal Action Network Aotearoa, calling on the Government to rule out the expansion of fossil fuels in New Zealand by not allowing the Te Kuha coal mine on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
	&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK --&gt;
&lt;div class="box-holder"&gt;
&lt;div class="box"&gt;
&lt;div class="holder"&gt;
&lt;div class="frame"&gt;
&lt;div class="box-content"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Greenpeace balloon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;The Greenpeace balloon can carry three people - a pilot and two passengers, such as a campaigner and photographer or parachutist. Three more people are needed to form the ground crew.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balloon can only be launched in low winds (up to 10 knots). In many parts of the world, this means it can only be flown two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because during the day the sun heats up the atmosphere and creates thermals that make balloon flying dangerous. In winter months, when the sun's heat is less powerful, there is a better chance of making daytime flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balloon can stay airborne for a maximum of two hours in normal conditions (a cool temperature under 2000 metres above sea level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of balloon flight - free or tethered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During free flights, once launched the balloon is carried in the general direction of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot can steer the balloon to an extent by taking advantage of different wind directions at higher and lower altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;For tethered flights the wind speed must be less than for free flights (about 8 knots maximum), because the balloon is in effect resisting the wind and the hot air could be blown out of it, causing it to sink rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historic Greenpeace balloon flights include flights over the Berlin wall in 1983, over the US Nevada nuclear test site in 1987 and over the Taj Mahal during the nuclear testing protest in India in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace uses balloons for a variety of campaign purposes, such as for hanging banners, taking pictures of environmental crimes and measurements of airborne pollution from and as a platform for parachute jumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Envelope CAMERON including scoop, type Sphere 105&lt;br&gt;1 Nacelle CAMERON Aristocrat (Basket)&lt;br&gt;1 CAMERON burner MK 4 Super  (including 4 karabiners)&lt;br&gt;1 Blower&lt;br&gt;2 Standard Worthington Cylinders&lt;br&gt;3 Master Worthington Cylinders&lt;br&gt;1Remorque WESTFALIA  - (Trailer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign director of Greenpeace Canada, Jo Dufay describes her balloon flight over Quebec City, Canada on 20 April 2001:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the balloon rose past the citadel in Quebec City, the wind caught the top, stretching the balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant it was under-inflated, and we started to plummet. I looked down through the basket of seemingly flimsy wicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't trust this to hold my laundry, I thought, realising it was the only thing between me and the St Lawrence River below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we were rising again, as Franz, the pilot, turned the flame to a roar. The balloon swelled, the map of the world luminous on the balloon as we looked up through the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the flame reduced again, we sailed peacefully over the site of the Summit of the Americas, the balloon carrying a message for world leaders -"Stop Climate Change".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;In the sudden quiet we heard the Summit security helicopter - they were on to us.&lt;/p&gt;

	A new Greenpeace investigation has exposed the environmental risks of the fast-growing krill industry in one of the most pristine parts of the Antarctic Ocean.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The krill fishing industry removes a vital species from the Antarctic food web - tiny shrimp-like krill - eaten by blue whales, penguins, seals and other wildlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industrial trawling for krill is being driven by demand for products such as Omega-3 tablets, fishmeal for farmed fish and pet food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In New Zealand, there is a growing market of nutritional health supplements estimated to be worth $255 million. Krill oil has been identified as a "growth star" by the NZ seafood industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Krill health supplements are being marketed to Kiwis when we have alternatives which don’t involve taking away the food sources of whales, penguins and other animals," says Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Emily Hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Retailers shouldn’t be buying Antarctic krill from pristine ecosystems. The story of the krill industry is a murky one of vessels fishing from the bottom of the food chain near the feeding grounds of whales, penguins and other animals. They’re waging a tug-of-war for food."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five years Greenpeace has been tracking the movements of krill trawlers. Despite the industry presenting itself as one of the best managed fisheries in the world, Greenpeace’s new report, Licence to Krill: the little-known world of Antarctic fishing, paints a different picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org//new-zealand/en/reports/Licence-to-Krill/"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt; reveals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensive fishing taking place in the immediate vicinity of feeding grounds of Antarctic wildlife such as whales and penguins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking data suggests vessels have anchored close to specially protected areas, despite the potential impact on wildlife and the seafloor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activities suggesting risky fishing practices such as transhipment (transfer of catch) to huge reefers with long lists of previous infringements, such as poor safety records and low standards in pollution prevention from both sewage and oil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transhipment globally has often been linked to environmental and labour rights abuses due to the lack of transparency it affords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the krill fishing industry is centred on the Weddell Sea, an area being considered for the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand is one of 24 countries in the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR) deciding on the proposal in October.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile Greenpeace is calling on the krill fishing industry to immediately cease all fishing activities in these waters and for all businesses buying krill-derived products to stop sourcing from vessels that continue to fish in these same areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report comes during a three-month Greenpeace expedition to the Antarctic. The expedition has undertaken landmark scientific research as part of a campaign to create a network of ocean sanctuaries covering at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org//new-zealand/en/reports/Licence-to-Krill/"&gt;The report can be downloaded here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has today launched a campaign calling for the creation of the largest protected area on Earth - a 1.8 million square kilometre ocean sanctuary in the Antarctic.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As part of the campaign, the environmental organisation has set off on an expedition to Antarctica that will see the first humans ever visit the seafloor in the Weddell Sea. The area is the subject of an EU proposal for an ocean sanctuary to be considered by the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR) in October 2018. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner, Amanda Larsson, says the ship’s crew will undertake pioneering scientific research in submarines, document the area’s unique wildlife which is facing pressures from climate change, overfishing and pollution, and gather evidence of the urgent need for governments to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "This sanctuary would mean an urgently-needed safe zone for creatures like penguins, whales and seals that call the diverse Antarctic ecosystem home," she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "It would mean the waters would be off-limits to the massive industrial fishing fleets that want to suck up the tiny shrimp-like krill on which Antarctic life relies." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the Greenpeace expedition, Antarctic scientists will conduct research to identify vulnerable marine ecosystems and new species on the seabed including rare corals and sponges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This will provide further evidence for the need for comprehensive protection of the area. The crew will also undertake water sampling to identify the presence of any plastic pollution in this remote region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr Susanne Lockhart, a renowned Antarctic specialist with the California Academy of Sciences, is joining the expedition’s dives to the seafloor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The first steps have finally been taken by those entrusted to govern the Antarctic Ocean to protect one of the world's last pristine marine ecosystems; an ocean that connects all oceans," she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I'm excited to partner with Greenpeace and provide the science that will help determine areas which should be a priority for protection as countries work together to create the world's largest ocean sanctuary." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The expedition to Antarctica will take place over three months in the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise. The crew of 35 includes scientists, campaigners, submarine pilots and deckhands. Larsson says Greenpeace aims to spark a global movement calling for governments around the world to protect the Antarctic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Antarctica holds a special place for New Zealanders, and this was really cemented by Sir Edmund Hillary establishing Scott Base there in 1957," she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "New Zealand has a history of being at the forefront of the global fight to protect Antarctica, and last year we were successful in driving the creation of one of the world’s largest Marine Protected Areas in the Ross Sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Now we need to get behind the fight to create even greater protections for Antarctica. An Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary would not only safeguard the unique wildlife in the area, but it would also ensure the ocean has a chance to help defend against the worst effects of our changing climate." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more info: Sophie Schroder, Greenpeace NZ media &amp;amp; communications, 021 086 47450&lt;br&gt; Amanda Larsson, Greenpeace NZ campaigner, 021 722 794&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is campaigning for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary covering 1.8 million square kilometres in the Weddell Sea. The proposal has been submitted by the EU and backed by the German Government. It will be considered when CCAMLR next convenes, in October 2018. Greenpeace’s Antarctic expedition will run for three months from January to early April 2018.

	It’s now been one year since pressure from thousands of people around the world convinced the world’s largest food and drink company - Nestlé - to give Indonesian rainforests and their inhabitants a break by removing products responsible for deforestation from their supply-chains.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 250px; float: left; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 5px;"&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/forests/2011/kitkat-thanks-pic%20copy%20copy.jpg" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a truly extraordinary and inspiring campaign that saw supporters, activists and concerned consumers - both online and off - maintain relentless pressure for change, the food giant took a giant step forwards by agreeing to a set of unprecedented commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, Nestlé announced its partnership with The Forest Trust (TFT) to implement a program that would see deforestation removed from all of its products as well as provide the kind of accountability and transparency so often lacking from such commitments. The company is making a serious attempt to raise the bar when it comes to corporate action against deforestation and we will continue encouraging them along this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tangible commitments from a company like Nestlé plainly demonstrates not only the importance of the issue, but also the effectiveness of one of our most innovative, sustained and well supported campaigns to date. People power in action is a beautiful thing and everyone involved deserves a big congratulations and a thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, after we launched the campaign online, the removal of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/kitkat/"&gt;'Have a break?'&lt;/a&gt; from YouTube sparked a groundswell of interest as well a rapidly escalating PR disaster for Nestlé. Views of the video shot up and helped to drive interest in the campaign –the total number of views on all versions of the video is currently two million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later and we have seen Nestlé - in collaboration with TFT - adopt new Responsible Sourcing Guidelines (RSGs), supply-chain maps for almost all palm oil and a supplier assessment process that sees Nestlé working with suppliers to identify shortcomings and help them to become a No Deforestation supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets better! In an inspiring demonstration of the infectious nature of change, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) - the palm oil arm of the Sinar Mas Group announced earlier this year its adoption of a Forest Conservation Policy, as a direct result of the pressure from Nestlé and other companies like Unilever and Kraft. Working with The Forest Trust, GAR has committed to halt the clearing of areas designated High Carbon Storage (HCS), peatlands and areas of High Conservation Value - including areas vital to local livelihoods and animal habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there is still a lot of work to be done. Despite such positive and encouraging developments, Indonesia’s rainforest continues to disappear at a terrifying rate. While GAR, one arm of Sinar Mas, makes commitments to conservation, another of its companies - Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) - continues to pulp millions of tonnes of Indonesian rainforest every year; including the habitat of the endangered Sumatran tiger and areas of High Carbon Storage. A map released by the Indonesian government to accompany &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/natalia-truchi/"&gt;last week’s announcement of a moratorium&lt;/a&gt;, which puts a temporary halt to forest destruction, makes clear that the Indonesian government will keep allowing APP to destroy significant areas of natural forest and peatland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP and Sinar Mas need to hear the demands of people all over the world and feel the pressure of the amazing momentum that is building towards forest protection. Until it implements policies that stop the ongoing destruction of Indonesia’s carbon-rich peatlands and rainforests, the Sinar Mas group will continue to sell rainforest destruction in its products and Greenpeace will continue to investigate and expose its malpractices.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 30.8.11: Greenpeace stand behind all of the statements we have made regarding Sealord’s tuna sourcing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We believe that the public has the right to know the ecological impact of the food they purchase, in order to make informed choices at the checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is running a global campaign to stop the indiscriminate practice of fishing with purse seine nets set around fish aggregation devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been in discussions with Sealord and other canned tuna brands in New Zealand concerning the serious environmental problems regarding this fishing method since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to these discussions Foodstuffs announced in June that it would change most of its Pams range of canned tuna to FAD-free by the end of the 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition all of the major tuna brands in the UK – including John West, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/you-did-it-princes-will-indeed-change-their-tuna-and-so-will-asda-20110309"&gt;Princes&lt;/a&gt; and the supermarkets &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/you-did-it-princes-will-indeed-change-their-tuna-and-so-will-asda-20110309"&gt;Asda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.j-sainsbury.com/cr/index.asp?pageid=67&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=sourcing&amp;amp;casestudy=30"&gt;Sainsbury’s&lt;/a&gt;, Co-op, Marks and Spencer, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/change-tuna-policy-one-more-reason-shop-morrisons-20110412"&gt;Morrisons&lt;/a&gt;, Waitrose and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/tesco-escapes-last-place-new-tinned-tuna-league-table-spectacular-policy-u-turn-20110109"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; have responded to Greenpeace’s campaign by committing to stop sourcing tuna from unsustainable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s interest is in protecting the future of our oceans. In this specific case our aim is to protect both the tuna and other sealife that is currently being wasted as a result of the high bycatch levels associated with use of FADs. We also aim to defend the rights of the Pacific  Island communities that depend upon healthy tuna stocks in the Pacific for their economic survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to Sealord doing the right thing by stopping the purchase of tuna caught using FADs and embracing more ecologically and socially responsible fishing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Wharekahika, Wednesday, 20 April 2011: The flotilla, with replenished supplies and crew will leave Wharekahika/Hick’s Bay today to return to the Rauku-mara Basin area.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today’s one year anniversary of the US Gulf of Mexico disaster – dubbed the worst environmental disaster in US history – serves as a warning to the dangers of deep sea oil drilling. The pollution has not disappeared. The impact continues to ricochet through marine and human food chains and has cost the US economy tens of billions of dollars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribal leader of te Wha-nau a- Apanui Rikirangi Gage has joined the flotilla today, for the first time, on board the fishing vessel San Pietro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I am setting to sea today to deliver the message directly to Petrobras that by the presence of their exploratory vessel they are stepping  on our mana tangata, mana whenua and mana moana, and that they are not welcome here and not endorsed to be here by te Wha-nau a-Apanui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“My message to John Key is, ‘We do not want the drilling – this is not the sort of industry we want for our people – we want clean and safe energy sources that do not risk our treasured waters and coasts.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Petrobras is surveying in the Rauku-mara Basin to drill for oil in waters up to twice the depths in which the Deepwater Horizon rig was working when the infamous blow out occurred. Even the best technology available to the oil industry and the world’s wealthiest economy couldn’t stem the oil gusher for 86 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Our own NZ Petroleum Exploration and Production Association admitted on Radio NZ today that “if you had a major catastrophe, it would be just as bad as the disaster in North America."  This is exactly why New Zealand should be investing in clean, safe energy,” said Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“On the anniversary of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster we sail to sea again to ensure that there is no repeat of that disaster in New Zealand waters”, said Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson on board Windbourne. “We are not intimidated by the navy, airforce and police presence and remain resolute in our determination to ensure that deep sea oil exploration and drilling does not happen in New Zealand waters”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla is made up of, and supported by, a coalition of individual skippers, peoples and groups including te Wha-nau a- Apanui, the Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla and Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland,  New Zealand brands of canned tuna are selling fish which has been caught using methods that are wiping out the main source of our tuna stocks from the Pacific and are killing endangered marine life, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today Greenpeace launched a new phase in its campaign to stop overfishing of Pacific tuna by asking its supporters and the public to contact the main brands of canned tuna and ask for a commitment that they follow the lead of brands in the UK and in other parts of the world that are shifting to more sustainably caught tuna. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign is being directed at Sealord, John West, Greenseas and the 'own brand' products of New Zealand’s two supermarket chains -Home Brand, Signature Range, Select and Pams. “The message to our tuna brands is ‘change your tuna’,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re challenging the brands to start sourcing truly sustainable fish and stop selling tuna that has been caught using destructive fishing methods which catch and kill endangered sharks and turtles and tuna so young that they haven't had a chance to reproduce.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas says the main method of catching skipjack tuna, the most common species used in canned tuna, is also one of the most destructive fishing methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Industrial fishing fleets use fish aggregation devices (FADs) which are like floating death traps, to lure tuna – then they scoop up everything in the area with huge purse seine nets. As well as the intended tuna catch this method kills up to 10 times more bycatch than more sustainable methods.” (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace call to New Zealand brands is part of a global campaign to stop the decline of tuna stocks and protect endangered ocean life. In recent years all but one of the UK’s major canned tuna brands have announced they will stop using tuna caught by purse seiners using fish aggregation devices. (3) This huge shift, in part due to Greenpeace rankings of tuna brands and pressure on companies, was described by major UK newspaper The Independent as “one of the most successful environmental campaigns in years.” (4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas says that New Zealand is lagging behind the other parts of the world when it comes to adopting standards that will ensure healthy oceans and plentiful tuna for future generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Alternative fishing methods are available, but New Zealand canned tuna brands are still selling us tuna netted using methods that also catch endangered sharks and turtles that are then dumped back into the ocean dead or dying. Kiwis deserve better standards that ensure the tuna they buy is sustainable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is also calling on New Zealand tuna fishing companies and the Government to support steps to ban destructive fishing methods and stop the decline of Pacific tuna stocks. This includes supporting a ban on fish aggregation devices and closing four areas of high seas in the Pacific to all fishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Pacific tuna stocks are in decline. Bigeye and yellowfin are the most at risk. Scientists have advised that fishing needs to be cut by up to 50 per cent in the Pacific to allow bigeye tuna to recover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more than 6000 vessels licensed to fish in the Western and Central Pacific region. In 2009 those vessels caught almost 2.5 million tonnes of tuna – around 60 per cent of the world’s tuna supply. Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation, working to create a more sustainable and equitable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans - necessary steps to creating healthy, living oceans.

	Ōpōtiki Thursday 21 April 2011: Around midnight flotilla yacht Secret Affair was contacted by Police from the Navy vessel HMNZS Taupō. Skipper David Armstrong was ordered to turn 90 degrees towards and into the seismic testing arrays that trail up to 10 kilometres behind the oil survey ship Orient Explorer. The Skipper of Secret Affair protested that this would be unwise. The Police forcefully repeated their orders for the Skipper to head into the arrays, which he then complied with.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Realising their mistake and panicking, the Police then ordered the Skipper to change course again in the opposite direction to move away from the array which sends out high decibel undersea acoustic explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the lack of clarity around legal jurisdiction the Police appear to be following the Government’s strategy and exaggerating safety issues in order to justify their intervention in a legitimate protest action where none exist,” said David Armstrong onboard &lt;em&gt;Secret Affair &lt;/em&gt;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “As soon we began protesting in the Raukūmara Basin opposing deep sea oil exploration and drilling, the Government created safety claims as a pretext for shutting down the Flotilla's peaceful protest,” said Armstrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the skippers, crew and activists involved in the flotilla are experienced and highly safety conscious. Te Whānau ā Apanui have navigated and fished these waters for many generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second yacht mentioned in the Police media release issued today is unknown to the flotilla that are opposing deep sea oil drilling. They were in all likelihood sailors enjoying a coastal cruise off the East Cape when they were descended upon by New Zealand’s armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

	Clothing giant H&amp;M has responded to a torrent of tweets, Facebook updates, and Detox sticker actions last week with a public commitment to Detox. Hazardous chemicals are out. Transparency and transformational change are in.

            Woot! First Puma, Nike and Adidas committed to clean up by 2020. Now H&amp;amp;M has committed to 2020 at the latest. Hurray to the clickers and stickers, to the activists and researchers, and to the companies who get it!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="clear:both"&gt;Sunlight is the best disinfectant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an amazing energy around Greenpeace right now, and it's not just because of &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/40-years-of-inspiring-action/blog/36808/"&gt;our birthday&lt;/a&gt;, or because this announcement brings us to &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/detox-campaign-hat-trick-adidas-joins-nike-an/blog/36569/"&gt;four clothing heavyweights&lt;/a&gt; who have committed to eliminate discharges of all hazardous chemicals across their entire supply chains, and their entire product life-cycle by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global fast fashion giant H&amp;amp;M has also agreed (&lt;a href="http://about.hm.com/gb/corporateresponsibility/greenpeace__Greenpeace.nhtml"&gt;H&amp;amp;M's commitment&lt;/a&gt;) to publicise information about chemicals being released from its suppliers' factories. The first round of information is due to be published by the end of 2012, and will include H&amp;amp;M's key suppliers in China and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live near factories around the world, not knowing what toxic and often invisible chemicals are being &lt;a href="/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/Hidden-Consequences/"&gt;discharged into local water supplies&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine the impact this water pollution information will have for local communities, journalists and officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International pressure works too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigners from our &lt;a href="/detox"&gt;Detox&lt;/a&gt; campaign spent all day Friday with H&amp;amp;M representatives, after activists in 12 countries spent a week sticking huge “Detox our future!” and "Detox our water!" stickers on the shop windows of H&amp;amp;M stores. Online activists and H&amp;amp;M fans from around the world also encouraged the Swedish retailer to Detox on Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="600" height="450" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=107931" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M uses Twitter extensively to share news about the brand, and to reply to comments from customers. So we launched a &lt;a href="http://act.ly/484"&gt;Twitter petition&lt;/a&gt; one week ago, which spread quickly around the world reaching over 635,000 people who are following the roughly 1,200 people who "retweeted" to sign it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company had to pick just one social network though, it would probably be Facebook, where no less than eight million people have "liked" &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/hm"&gt;H&amp;amp;M's page&lt;/a&gt;. Many of those fans began posting and "liking" comments and questions about the Detox campaign on H&amp;amp;M's Facebook page. By Friday morning, as our Detox campaigners arrived to meet representatives at H&amp;amp;M HQ in Stockholm, it was plain to see from the company's Facebook page that its reputation as a sustainability leader was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detox is so hot right now!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten weeks into our Detox campaign, &lt;a href="/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/detox-campaign-hat-trick-adidas-joins-nike-an/blog/36569/"&gt;the world's three biggest sportwear brands&lt;/a&gt;, and now one of the world's biggest clothing groups, have committed to eliminate discharges of all hazardous chemicals across their entire supply chains, and their entire product life-cycle by 2020. All four brands are now preparing individual Detox Action Plans to show how they will concretely put the detox commitment into practice to bring about real change in the clothing industry. Our campaigners will continue to work with these companies to ensure they live up to their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M is the largest clothing company featured in our &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/"&gt;Dirty Laundry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry-2/"&gt;Dirty Laundry 2&lt;/a&gt; reports, which detail the science behind the Detox campaign. Our research confirmed that H&amp;amp;M has links to factories discharging a range of hazardous chemicals into China's rivers, and that clothing -- including kids clothing -- sold by H&amp;amp;M, contain nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) that break down into the toxicnonylphenol (NP). These chemicals are a cause for serious concern, as they are known hormone disruptors and can be hazardous even at very low levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hype this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s success and influence means it is ideally positioned to be a catalyst for wider change in the clothing industry. By committing to Detox its supply chain, H&amp;amp;M is setting the trend for this season, and for every season to come. Which clothing company will be next to Detox? Who's going to wait to be called out by fans for committing the latest fashion faux pas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take action&lt;/h2&gt;

	It’s now been one year since pressure from thousands of people around the world convinced the world’s largest food and drink company - Nestlé - to give Indonesian rainforests and their inhabitants a break by removing products responsible for deforestation from their supply-chains.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 250px; float: left; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 5px;"&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/Global/international/artwork/forests/2011/kitkat-thanks-pic%20copy%20copy.jpg" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a truly extraordinary and inspiring campaign that saw supporters, activists and concerned consumers - both online and off - maintain relentless pressure for change, the food giant took a giant step forwards by agreeing to a set of unprecedented commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, Nestlé announced its partnership with The Forest Trust (TFT) to implement a program that would see deforestation removed from all of its products as well as provide the kind of accountability and transparency so often lacking from such commitments. The company is making a serious attempt to raise the bar when it comes to corporate action against deforestation and we will continue encouraging them along this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tangible commitments from a company like Nestlé plainly demonstrates not only the importance of the issue, but also the effectiveness of one of our most innovative, sustained and well supported campaigns to date. People power in action is a beautiful thing and everyone involved deserves a big congratulations and a thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, after we launched the campaign online, the removal of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/kitkat/"&gt;'Have a break?'&lt;/a&gt; from YouTube sparked a groundswell of interest as well a rapidly escalating PR disaster for Nestlé. Views of the video shot up and helped to drive interest in the campaign –the total number of views on all versions of the video is currently two million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later and we have seen Nestlé - in collaboration with TFT - adopt new Responsible Sourcing Guidelines (RSGs), supply-chain maps for almost all palm oil and a supplier assessment process that sees Nestlé working with suppliers to identify shortcomings and help them to become a No Deforestation supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets better! In an inspiring demonstration of the infectious nature of change, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) - the palm oil arm of the Sinar Mas Group announced earlier this year its adoption of a Forest Conservation Policy, as a direct result of the pressure from Nestlé and other companies like Unilever and Kraft. Working with The Forest Trust, GAR has committed to halt the clearing of areas designated High Carbon Storage (HCS), peatlands and areas of High Conservation Value - including areas vital to local livelihoods and animal habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there is still a lot of work to be done. Despite such positive and encouraging developments, Indonesia’s rainforest continues to disappear at a terrifying rate. While GAR, one arm of Sinar Mas, makes commitments to conservation, another of its companies - Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) - continues to pulp millions of tonnes of Indonesian rainforest every year; including the habitat of the endangered Sumatran tiger and areas of High Carbon Storage. A map released by the Indonesian government to accompany &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/natalia-truchi/"&gt;last week’s announcement of a moratorium&lt;/a&gt;, which puts a temporary halt to forest destruction, makes clear that the Indonesian government will keep allowing APP to destroy significant areas of natural forest and peatland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP and Sinar Mas need to hear the demands of people all over the world and feel the pressure of the amazing momentum that is building towards forest protection. Until it implements policies that stop the ongoing destruction of Indonesia’s carbon-rich peatlands and rainforests, the Sinar Mas group will continue to sell rainforest destruction in its products and Greenpeace will continue to investigate and expose its malpractices.&lt;/p&gt;

	Ōpōtiki, Monday 4 April, 2011: The flotilla opposed to deep sea oil drilling entered the zone in the Raukumara Basin where seismic testing is scheduled to begin today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Seismic testing ship, Orient Explorer departed Tauranga Harbour last night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a powerful welcome and meeting with local iwi te Whanau a Apanui on the weekend, skippers of the Stop Deep Sea Oil flotilla resolved to sail out and meet the seismic testing vessel in the protest tradition of “bearing witness” used during the decades of the Nuclear Free Pacific campaign. A boat from te Whanau a Apanui has joined the flotilla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla’s largest sailing vessel Infinity departed Whangaparaoa, East Cape North Island yesterday and sailed through the night to enter the testing zone early this morning. It is expected to encounter the Orient Explorer in the next 24 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand spokesperson Steve Abel said, “As New Zealanders we regard our coastlines and oceans as national treasures that are much too valuable to risk with oil spills”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla’s departure coincides with the leaking of the Government’s Energy Strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Right as the Deep Sea Oil protest flotilla is fighting for a clean energy future and is determined that deep sea oil drilling does not happen in New Zealand waters, this current Energy Strategy will mire New Zealand into an even deeper dependency on polluting fossil fuels. The Government couldn’t have got it more wrong”, said Steve Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“No one is saying petrol pumps will be turned off tomorrow. Our dependence on fossil fuels won’t end overnight but our investment from now on needs to be in clean energy - not looking for the last drops of oil in the most risky places”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Orient Explorer is under contract to Brazilian petrol giant Petrobras to do seismic surveying. The permit was granted by Gerry Brownlee to Petrobras in 2010, at the same time as oil was pouring into the US Gulf of Mexico in the infamous BP deep sea oil disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To estimate the size of an oil reserve beneath the deep sea floor, survey ships tow up to ten kilometres of multiple airgun floats that emit thousands of high-decibel explosive impulses to map the geology beneath the seafloor. Seismic surveys have been implicated in harming marine life and migrations, including whale beaching and stranding incidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Conservation states that beaked whales live in the Raukumara Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flotilla is opposing all aspects of the deep sea exploration and drilling programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Just as Energy Minister Gerry Brownlee misled the mining industry last year by attempting to open up high value conservation land to mining, our government has misled the deep sea oil industry by saying our oceans are open to them. Last year New Zealanders opposed mining on our conservation land and the Government listened. The Government now needs to respond to the growing opposition against deep sea oil drilling by stating that deep sea oil companies are not welcome here”, concluded Abel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information contact:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Steve Abel on 021927 301&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Communications Officer Dean Baigent-Mercer on 021 302 251&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information on the Flotilla &lt;a href="http://www.stopdeepseaoil.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;www.stopdeepseaoil.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says a plan to increase the catch limits of several bottom trawled New Zealand fish species highlights how out of touch the Ministry of Fisheries is with international markets.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Fisheries is proposing to reopen one of three closed orange roughy stocks that has not been fished since 2000 when overfishing drove it to collapse, to raise the annual hoki catch and to increase the catch of rubyfish, a deep sea species it admits it knows almost nothing about (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is no justification to trawl up more of these fish, especially as international markets are increasingly rejecting seafood that isn’t caught sustainably,” said Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week two US distributors have joined the growing number of companies in the seafood supply chain removing orange roughy from sale (2). Costco, which has 569 wholesale outlets, announced it would stop selling orange roughy and several other species that it said were “nearly universally identified as at great risk” (3). And on Tuesday San Francisco based ABS Seafood confirmed orange roughy and Chilean sea bass (toothfish) will no longer be stocked (4).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The New Zealand Government should be supporting our fisheries that are based on healthy stocks and sustainable fishing methods with sound research and careful management” said Thomas. “It’s not the Ministry of Fisheries’ role to try and salvage market access for fisheries that are driving stocks to collapse, killing endangered species and annihilating marine ecosystems – that’s greenwash, not sustainability.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas said the management of New Zealand’s orange roughy fisheries was a scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The orange roughy stock they’re proposing to open for business again was grossly overfished to only three per cent of its original population before the Ministry finally stepped in and closed it. The indication that stocks have started to rebuild is a miracle of nature, not a testament to good management.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orange roughy live for more than 100 years and do not start reproducing until 25 to 30-years-old, making the species extremely vulnerable to overfishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plans to decrease catch limits within a second orange roughy stock, and for black cardinalfish, were too little and too late, she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Ministry is failing in its obligation to protect our oceans, and hasn’t learnt from past mistakes. These fisheries, which are in obvious decline, should be closed immediately.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall the ministry needed to be taking a more precautionary approach with all stocks and should not be rushing to increase the hoki catch based on a couple of good years recruitment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Instead of tackling issues like the industry’s heavy reliance on destructive bottom trawling, the Ministry is running around like it’s a fish marketing board, trying to prop open doors that are closing for seafood that doesn’t meet the sustainability standards of our export markets.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Submissions on the Ministry of Fisheries’ proposed changes to catch limits close on Wednesday 4 August 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes to Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

	Auckland, 11 September 2012 -  Greenpeace congratulated the Australian Government today for showing the courage to prevent the Abel Tasman super trawler fishing in Australian waters.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Super trawlers use an indiscriminate fishing method which can decimate fish stocks and kill turtles, dolphins, seals and other marine animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first super trawler arrived in South Australia at the end of August. At that time it was named the Margiris (1). New Zealanders Peter and Donna Simunovich are major shareholders in the joint venture which was about to start operating the ship in South Australian waters.(2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace hailed it as a victory for the Australian community which has united to reject this monster ship. The decision also sends a message to the global super-sized fishing fleets that world community opposition is growing to their unsustainable business model. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is what happens when we all stand together,” said Greenpeace Head of Campaigns Ben Pearson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Thousands of people across Australia turned out to rallies, sent letters to editors, and pressured their local MPs. More than one person signed the Greenpeace petition ‘No super trawlers’ every minute.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The two year ban is welcome and we always support more scientific investigations into how we manage our oceans more sustainably,” said Pearson.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace will continue its global campaign against overfishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The decision today by the Gillard Government will give heart to communities and campaigners across the globe who continue to oppose super trawlers like the Abel Tasman and the devastating business model it represents.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The global overfishing problem has not gone away”, said Ben Pearson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is 2.5 times more fishing capacity in the world than there are fish. This decision will put pressure on the European Union to withdraw their subsidies from the super trawler fleet and is a step towards more sustainable fishing.” said Pearson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas added; “This monster ship must not continue prowling the world's oceans in search of new fishing grounds to plunder. She must return to Europe where the problems of massive government subsidies to unsustainable fishing and excessive fishing fleets need to be tackled head-on through the reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Just over a month ago Greenpeace activists prevented the Margiris from leaving port for five days in the Netherlands before it departed for Australia. Earlier in the year Greenpeace activists painted her side with the word PLUNDER in Mauritania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The Margiris is being operated by a joint venture between Seafish Tasmania and Seafish Tasmania Pelagic, a fully owned subsidiary of Parlevliet &amp;amp; Van der Plas BV. Seafish Tasmania Pty Ltd company information sourced from company extract purchased from ASIC and current on 23rd of August 2012. The Suminovich stake in Seafish Tasmania should be included here as well, shouldn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has discovered five kilometres of abandoned pirate fishing line bearing fish so valuable they are known as ‘white gold’ in illegal fishing circles. Crew, including five New Zealanders, on board the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise released up to 60 live toothfish to the icy waters of the Antarctic after unhooking them from the pirate’s abandoned longline.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The MV Arctic Sunrise is scouring the Southern Ocean for pirate fishers who to date have poached more than 100,000 tonnes of toothfish valued at NZ$1,000 million. Pirate fishers also hook and drown between 60,000-100,000 seabirds in their fishing gear - including critically endangered species of albatross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders cannot claim to be proud of protecting Antarctica while we stand by and watch its fish stocks being plundered for profit and seabirds pushed to the brink of extinction" says Sarah Duthie, Ocean Ecology Campaigner, Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand must take the lead in stopping the illegal plunder of the fragile Antarctic ecosystem, by calling for a moratorium on the toothfish fishery backed by an international trade ban." says Duthie. "As a leading advocate for the conservation of Antarctica the government is in a perfect position to push other members states to adopt a moratorium at CCAMLR."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) was set up in 1982 to manage and protect Southern Ocean fisheries. It has consistently failed to stop the over-exploitation of Antarctic marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While CCAMLR's intentions are good, in its 18-year history it has consistently failed to stop pirates from systematically destroying our last true marine wilderness," says Denise Boyd, Greenpeace oceans campaigner onboard the Arctic Sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest images transmitted this morning from the MV Arctic Sunrise, show the activists recovering the "longline" fishing gear and releasing the fish - measuring up to about one metre in length and weighing an average of 12 kilos - from the many thousands of hooks attached to the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists estimate that Patagonian Toothfish (also known as deep sea or Chilean sea bass) will be commercially extinct within two years. A valuable source of food for elephant seals and other marine mammals, the illegal pillage places the fragile Antarctic ecosystem in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its second journey to the Southern Ocean pirate fishing grounds in two years, Greenpeace has already chased one pirate vessel, the Belize- flagged and Spanish-owned Grand Prince, from the area managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). This longline is the third abandoned pirate longline found by the Greenpeace crew this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish piracy in the Southern Ocean is a classic example of the growing pirate fishing problem in world fisheries - a problem now recognised by the international community. Many of these pirate fishing vessels are flagged to notorious flag-of-convenience states such as Belize and Panama.&lt;/p&gt;

	Ōpōtiki, Thursday 7 April 2011: The Prime Minister John Key yesterday evening revealed on Radio New Zealand’s Wātea News that he’s been poorly informed on deep sea drilling plans for New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;John Key claimed that the Raukūmara Basin where Petrobras is currently conducting seismic testing for oil drilling, is not as deep as the location of last year’s Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the US Gulf of Mexico: “I don't think it’s in nearly as deep as water as what we saw in The Gulf”, he said (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In fact it is up to twice the depth”, said Steve Abel, Greenpeace New Zealand’s Climate Campaigner, “The big oil companies are hunting in increasingly more extreme places because the days of easily accessible oil are over. This is why we must begin to wean ourselves off oil and onto renewable fuel sources. The costs of exploration and extraction will continue to increase and with them the risks of environmental disasters”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key also wrongly asserted that, “Any offshore drilling operation there's obviously environmental risks, but New Zealand has proven it can manage those risks”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further showing his lack of knowledge he implied that deep water drilling has been occurring in Taranaki for some years when Taranaki’s fields are mostly in shallow coastal waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…and as the people of Taranaki show and tell us it’s been very, very successful for a long period of time,” said Key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Also to claim things are going swimmingly in Taranaki when oil has washed up along the Kapiti coastline (2) isn’t accurate,” said Abel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The exploratory drill at the location of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster was at 1500 metres, whereas the Raukūmara Basin is mostly over 2000 metres and deeper with areas up to 3000 metres. This is twice the depth at which the disaster occurred in the US Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Key also claimed that we had adequate safety measures, high environmental standards and this proved the Government had good risk management – but this both contradicts his own ministers and even the oil industry itself. There is only one full time inspector devoted to oil rigs within the New Zealand EEZ (3). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace, Forest and Bird, Board Riders Against Drilling and other organisations have joined to support the call by te Whānau ā Apanui to protect the Raukūmara Basin from deep sea oil drilling.

	The amount of electronic products discarded globally has skyrocketed recently, with 20-50 million tonnes generated every year. If such a huge figure is hard to imagine, think of it like this - if the estimated amount of e-waste generated every year would be put into containers on a train it would go once around the world!
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Electronic waste (e-waste) now makes up five percent of all municipal solid waste worldwide, nearly the same amount as all plastic packaging, but it is much more hazardous. Not only developed countries generate e-waste; Asia discards an estimated 12 million tonnes each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste is now the fastest growing component of the municipal solid waste stream because people are upgrading their mobile phones, computers, televisions, audio equipment and printers more frequently than ever before. Mobile phones and computers are causing the biggest problem because they are replaced most often. In Europe e-waste is increasing at three to five percent a year, almost three times faster than the total waste stream. Developing countries are also expected to triple their e-waste production over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland Tuesday May 31 2011: Despite what it says to the contrary, the Government is not interested in true economic prosperity, as shown by today’s announcement not to support the building of Auckland’s rail loop, says Greenpeace New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The economic benefits of the rail loop have been thoroughly assessed by the likes of the UC Berkeley Transportation Centre, and Pricewaterhouse Coopers,” says Greenpeace NZ Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the Government has ignored the Loop’s potential, instead opting to progress those pet projects that are consistent with its narrow-minded, old-fashioned ‘dig and burn’ approach to economic development: deep sea oil, new coal mines in national parks, and more motorways, which will only increase the economy’s exposure to the volatile world oil market, and of course just make the climate crisis worse,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s this type of thinking that’s driving the oil industry to open up its final frontiers in the pristine Arctic, and in the deep waters off New   Zealand’s coast,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Loop is an urgent and essential piece of transport infrastructure to make Auckland a functioning modern city and begin to de-couple our economy from the daily costs of fossil fuel dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a major setback for Auckland economically and in terms of the quality of life in our biggest city.  It maintains the decades-old, government approach towards transport decisions being about roads versus rail.  We are all suffering at the petrol pump but the alternative modes of transport – whilst improving – are still woefully under funded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As usual, Auckland is being held back by a lack of forward thinking by Central Government, which only listens to groups like Federated Farmers, Fonterra, the Road Transport Forum, and overseas oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why not listen to what Aucklanders want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government is always talking about belt-tightening, but it’s already spent $30 million of taxpayer’s money on subsidising the international oil industry’s activities, and plans to spend $400 million on damming the South Island’s rivers, as a giant subsidy for industrial dairy farming,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland June 22 2011: Greenpeace announced today that it supports the Keep Kiwis Working and the Rail and Maritime Union (RMTU) campaigns to save 41 workers at the Hillside rail plant in Dunedin from losing their jobs.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The jobs being made redundant at Hillside are a great example of ‘green collar’ jobs – a sector that New Zealand should be expanding, not sending offshore, if we want sustainable employment and economic prosperity,” says Greenpeace NZ’s Michael Tritt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is turning increasingly to public transport as an important part of the solution to rising oil prices and climate change. The kind of jobs and skills they want to cut at Hillside are going to be in growing demand in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s another major step in the wrong direction under Transport Minister Steven Joyce’s watch.  Having recently refused to fund Auckland’s central rail tunnel the Government’s failure to intervene to save the Hillside workshop cuts will only lock this country into an even greater dependence on oil, along with all the negative downstream social, economic and environmental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again the Government is showing a blatant unwillingness to support those local industries that could be a part of a multi-billion dollar clean economic transformation, while it is falling over itself to subsidise high-risk exploration for fossil fuels and build unnecessary new motorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Tritt and others from Greenpeace will attend the public meeting tonight (Wednesday 22 June) in Dunedin hosted by the &lt;em&gt;Keep Kiwis Working Campaign&lt;/em&gt; and the RMTU.  The meeting begins at 7.00 p.m. at the Cargill Enterprises Hall, 199 Hillside Rd, Dunedin.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland July 26 2011: The Government’s announcement that it will spend billions on roads, but only a comparatively small amount on public transport, shows that its ideas for economic growth and transport come straight out of the 1950s, Greenpeace New Zealand says. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The consequence of the Government’s plans will have a negative impact on the economy, resulting in increased household fuel costs, and a burgeoning emissions burden,” says Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is to be spent over the next 10 years, as detailed in the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport Funding, released today by Transport Minister Steven Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government talks about roads creating economic growth. But all that will grow as a result of this plan is road congestion, vehicle emissions, and household petrol costs,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile rail - with its huge potential to free up our roads and meet transport needs, while reducing New Zealand’s oil dependency – is being starved at the margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This budget is straight out of the 1950s, when naive transport planners began destroying our diverse and effective transport network in the name of roads, roads, and more roads,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Real growth comes from smart thinking, and real growth is only going to come from making the transition to a clean economy. An efficient transport network is a vital part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Distributing the billions allocated to new roads instead to projects like the CBD rail loop for Auckland, and by providing seed money for our best cleantech entrepreneurs, would yield far better returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand’s future doesn’t lie in increasing our reliance on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The numbers of people using rail in Auckland has recently jumped by 20 per cent, to over eight million trips. People are voting with their feet for public transport yet Joyce refuses to unlock the Auckland network with the urgently needed CBD rail loop,” Abel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ‘Roads of National Significance’ mentioned in the plan is the Puhoi to Wellsford ‘Holiday Highway.’ A CDB rail loop was preferred over the Holiday Highway by the vast majority of respondents in a recent NZ Herald Digipoll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	None of Canada’s major supermarket chains will be selling orange roughy after leading retailers dropped the species due to sustainability concerns, Greenpeace reports.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Last week Canadian retailer Metro announced it would remove a number of seafoods from sale, including New Zealand hoki and orange roughy (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro was the last of Canada’s eight major supermarkets to be selling orange roughy, following the rejection of the species by retail chains Overwaitea, Loblaw, Safeway and Sobeys over the past two years. It is the first Canadian retailer to remove New Zealand hoki from its shelves (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner Karli Thomas said it was ironic that as Canadian supermarkets were closing the door to orange roughy and hoki imports the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries (3) last week announced an increase in the hoki catch and re-opened an orange roughy stock that was fished to collapse a decade ago and has been closed since (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand’s orange roughy fisheries are a scandal. The Challenger Plateau population that has just been re-opened was trawled to near oblivion over two decades, plummeting to only three per cent before the fishery was closed in 2001. Many companies in the seafood supply chain now refuse to trade in the species (5),” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand supermarkets continue to sell orange roughy and other species from the Greenpeace seafood red list (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sadly it seems that retailers in our export markets are showing more concern for New Zealand’s ocean than the likes of Countdown and New World where New Zealanders do their shopping, or our own Ministry of Fisheries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Too many protected species like dolphins, fur seals, sea lions and albatross are dying in New Zealand fisheries, stocks of many species are at or near the point of collapse and earlier this year the Ministry increased the catch of bluefin tuna, despite the species being listed as Critically Endangered and more than 95 per cent being wiped out already.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand can’t be complacent about our fisheries. The claim that all New Zealand seafood is sustainable is plainly untrue, and until the Ministry and industry get serious about addressing these issues, doors to our export markets will continue to slam shut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro’s rejection of orange roughy and hoki is part of a sustainable fisheries policy being implemented by the company – which operates some 600 stores – that also includes labeling seafood products with information on the species and where and how it was caught (7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Metro’s policy was announced on 23 September and will be fully implemented by June 2011. The company will remove seven species from sale across its 600 stores, as well as improving seafood labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metro.ca/corpo/centre-nouvelles/communiques2010/20100923.en.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metro.ca/corpo/centre-nouvelles/communiques2010/20100923.en.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) In 2009 and again in 2010 Greenpeace ranked Canada’s eight major supermarket chains on the basis of seafood sustainability. The ranking of supermarkets can be found on page 7 and a summary of the species removed from sale on page 9 of the report ‘Taking Stock’ &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-canada/taking-stock" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/canada//taking-stock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Last week the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries announced the commercial catch of hoki will increase by 10,000 tonnes on 1 October 2010, taking it to 120,000 tonnes per year. Hoki is New   Zealand’s third most valuable seafood export after mussels and rock lobster, earning $152 million in 2009. Concerns about the fishery include the use of the destructive bottom trawl fishing method and the bycatch of fur seals and seabirds. &lt;a href="http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Press/Catch+limit+changes+for+important+fish+species.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Press/Catch+limit+changes+for+important+fish+species.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) The Challenger Plateau orange roughy stock was overfished to a shocking 3% of its original level, and was closed from 2001. The species is extremely long-lived (120 years) slow to mature (23-32 years) and is caught only by bottom trawl fishing, making the fishery inherently unsustainable. Three of New Zealand’s eight stocks have been fished to collapse, and a further three areas are close to the 10% level at which they are considered collapsed under the New Zealand Harvest Strategy Standard. A summary of New Zealand’s orange roughy fisheries is available online: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/orange-roughy" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/orange-roughy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists have barricaded the entrance to Fonterra’s corporate headquarters in Princes St, Auckland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The (1.8 high x 2.4 metre long) barricade has large TV screens built into it, which are delivering shocking scenes from the expansion of the currently unsustainable palm industry into the rainforests of South East Asia. Fonterra buys its palm kernel animal feeds from this industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Greenpeace New Zealand-led team was arrested and detained for 23 hours in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, last Sunday (September 19 – 20) while documenting this expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The memory cards and tapes from their cameras were wiped, in an effort to censor what the team had witnessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the team had already sent some vision back to New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those images are included in the video being played out of the barricade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace team is also this morning moving through Fonterra’s offices, handing out information to staff, and installing speakers inside the building’s lifts, each of which have a recorded message addressing Fonterra’s staff .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the interests of the safety, the fire exits from the building have not been blocked. All entrances to the building remain open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barricade has put in place at 8 am this morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Images from the event, taken from inside and outside the building, are available (details below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that Fonterra and the Government put an end to New Zealand’s importation of palm kernel grown on areas of destroyed rainforest.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deforestation in South East Asia is driving climate change and pushing endangered species like the orangutan to the brink of extinction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Twelve months after Fonterra’s connection to the palm industry was exposed by the ‘Sunday Star Times’ and Greenpeace, the dairy giant has only increased the quantities of palm kernel it buys to feed its dairy herd.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Fonterra has implicated New Zealand in this shocking aspect of the palm industry through its unnecessary use of palm kernel,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Communications Manager Suzette Jackson, who was one of those detained on Sunday.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The site, or concession, that the team documented is typical of the currently unsustainable practices of the palm industry. Now being cleared by Sinar Mas, this area of rainforest is thought to be part of one of the last refuges for the critically endangered orang-utan. A High Conservation Value Assessment is required to meet Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards. Yet despite Sinar Mas’, subsidiary PT SMART (which own the concession the Greenpeace team visited last weekend), being a member of the RSPO, there is no sign of any such assessment having been performed for this concession.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“As the palm industry opens up new frontiers across Indonesia, companies like Fonterra, which is expected to spend NZ$230 million this year buying up a quarter of the world’s traded palm kernel, is helping to fuel this destruction,” Jackson says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;According to recent estimates, Indonesia is the third largest greenhouse gas polluter of any nation on the planet, largely due to the destruction of its rainforest and peatlands. (1)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid industrialisation of dairying in New Zealand, driven by Fonterra, is driving the increased use of palm kernel as a supplementary feed. Greenpeace New Zealand maintains that relying on pasture and local alternatives for emergency drought relief, such as maize silage, which is grown by New Zealand farmers, are the best options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This year it is expected New Zealand will import well over one million tonnes of palm kernel for Fonterra’s farms. (2)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This flies in the face of the actions taken by other companiesincluding Nestlé, Kraft, and Unilever, all of which have recently dropped contracts with Sinar Mas due to its environmentally destructive practices. In addition, Burger King has committed to removing Sinar Mas products from its supply chain in response to a recent auditor’s report into Sinar Mas’ activities. (3) Meanwhile, Cadbury New Zealand has publicly stated that it stopped using palm oil in its Dairy Milk products after a consumer campaign led by the Auckland Zoo.(4)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Fonterra is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage as companies like these respond to public concerns over the worst environmental impacts of the palm products industry,” says Jackson.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fonterra’s half-owned subsidiary, RD1, has a joint venture with international palm oil and palm kernel producer and trader Wilmar – the company International Nutritionals Limited. It is estimated that Wilmar buys over half its palm products from third parties. (5) Wilmar has no systems in place to ensure that suppliers involved in rainforest destruction, like Sinar Mas, are excluded from its supply chain. Palm kernel expeller is then supplied by companies in New Zealand, such as RD1, to Fonterra farms here in New Zealand.

	Greenpeace says a box locked into a lift at the Fonterra building during this morning’s protest played a sound recording and posed no threat.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Police cleared the building shortly after the box was discovered. At 9am staff were allowed to return to their offices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The box was installed by activists at 8am as part of an activity to make Fonterra staff aware of the cost of using palm kernel grown on destroyed rainforest in South East Asia. It played a voice recording combined with the sound of chainsaws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid said this activity was a peaceful protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace New Zealand takes protest actions seriously and all our volunteer activists are highly trained, calm and respectful of police and emergency services. The right to peaceful protest is the foundation of a democratic society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has peacefully protested for over 30 years and taking action is at the core of what we do as an organisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is only an hour’s disruption for Fonterra’s staff who make daily decision about importing palm kernel which is leading to a lifetime of disruption for the tens of thousands of people in Indonesia and Malaysia who are having their rainforested land destroyed by the palm products industry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Due to increased deforestation in South East Asia everyone in the world will be facing huge disruptions from the runaway emissions causing climate change,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier Greenpeace activists blocked the front entrance to the building. The barricade had two large television screens built into it which delivered shocking scenes of rainforest destruction recorded by a Greenpeace documentation team in East Kalimantan last weekend. Police have removed the barricade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No other doors or exits were blocked during the protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police have detained two Greenpeace activists.&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington 24/7/12: Groups from around the country have this afternoon converged on Parliament to deliver a 140,000-plus signature petition, calling on John Key’s Government to abandon its fossil fuels agenda, in favour of clean energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Groups and individuals supporting the hand-in event came from the East Cape (Te Whanau a Apanui), Hamilton, Raglan, Nelson, Christchurch, and Dunedin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time a 2000 signature-strong petition was also delivered by Oil-Free Otago, protesting Texan oil giant Anadarko’s plans to begin deep sea drilling off the Otago and Canterbury coasts as early as this summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is a message the Government can’t ignore,” said Simon Boxer, Greenpeace New Zealand Senior Climate Campaigner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Well over 100,000 New Zealanders have given a definite ‘no’ to deep sea oil, and to any expansion of the coal industry. Instead they’ve said they want their energy to come from clean, renewable sources, that don’t come with the risk of either a catastrophic oil spill, or runaway climate change.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among those who travelled to Wellington for the event was the Chairperson of Te Whanau a Apanui Runanga, Adelaide Waititi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are heartened by the number of people who’ve put their name to the growing movement to keep deep sea oil rigs out of the waters of Aotearoa, including off the East Cape,” she said.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Deep sea oil drilling off our coasts threatens the economy, our pristine coastlines, and Otago’s future as a whole,” said Niamh O’Flynn, from Oil-Free Otago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The success of our petition has shown that people from all over Otago are strongly opposed to drilling in the Canterbury Basin, and are angered by the lack of public consultation over the issue,” she said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico forced the authorities to close off an area of ocean twice the size of the North Island,” says J Beaudry, from the Raglan-based surfer’s protest group, B-Rad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Anadarko, one of the companies headed to New Zealand, owned a quarter share of the Deepwater Horizon project. What’s to stop the same thing happening to one of its deep water rigs, only this time off our coast,” Beaudry asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the costs of ignoring clean energy alternatives won’t only be environmental, according to Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Government’s fossil fuel agenda is causing New Zealand to miss out on billions of dollars of clean energy contracts and thousands of jobs. To ignore the financial opportunities for New Zealand arising from the global clean energy revolution, that last year was worth over US$250 billion(1), is nothing short of economic mismanagement," he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The delivery of the petition comes as the Government’s EEZ legislation is before the House. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The EEZ legislation won’t stop an oil spill. It is designed simply to make it look as though the Government cares about the consequences of its obsession with fossil fuels, when it does not,” Boxer said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday the trial of Elvis Teddy, a member of Te Whanau a Apanui, began in the Tauranga District Court. Teddy is facing charges in relation to his participation in the 2011 Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week Greenpeace and Te Whanau a Apanui appealed an early decision not to revoke the permit given to Petrobras to explore for oil in the deep water off the East Cape. The two groups contend that the permit is illegitimate, because the potential effects of a major oil spill were not considered by the Minister before he granted the permit, and because Te Whanau a Apanui were not adequately consulted before the permit was granted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Editor’s notes: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1)    http://www.bnef.com/PressReleases/view/180&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The text on the petition reads: “To Prime Minister John Key and the New Zealand Government: We call on you to permanently stop all plans to open up New Zealand’s coastal waters to dangerous offshore drilling, and stop any expansion of coal mining in New Zealand. We demand a clean energy future the helps combat climate change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each box contains approximately 5000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Farming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;New Zealand's agriculture sector emits more greenhouse gases than all transport combined -- but it doesn't have to be that way.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want New Zealand to be farming into the future and passing on truly sustainable, healthy farms to future generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealanders take immense pride in our farming sector, but more and more this is being tainted by industrial agricultural practices that are damaging our land, waterways and our international reputation as a clean, green producer. Farming is part of who we are as a nation but we should not allow it to continue to be industrialised at the cost of our environment and economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a little known fact that agriculture also makes up half of all New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions. Increased use of chemical fertilisers, increases in the number of cows per acre, and the destruction of forests for pastures are all contributing to make agriculture's emissions unacceptable for a world facing the challenges of a changing climate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some New Zealand farmers are making the right choices, adopting practices that are not only better for the climate and the environment, but also for their bottom lines.     &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It's known globally as "ecological farming".  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eco-farming is about reverting back to more traditional farming practices. It's about less input, and better output. It's about cutting down on chemicals, cutting back on herd numbers and looking after soil so that pasture thrives and lasts. Generations of farmers have successfully used this method in New Zealand - they knew how to work with the land and doing so is how they survived. In a way it's time to go back to basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agriculture and climate change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is a very greenhouse-gas intensive form of land use   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two thirds of our agricultural emissions come from the methane emitted when cows burp. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO²). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The remaining emissions are from the nitrous oxide gas produced in soil from artificial fertilizer use, livestock urine and manure. It is an astounding 300 times more potent than CO².     &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Agriculture's nitrous oxide emissions are higher than New Zealand's road transport emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/climate-change/smart-farming/agriculture-and-climate-change/nz-farming/"&gt;corporatisation and industrialisation&lt;/a&gt; of the dairy sector is by far our biggest contribution to global climate change. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;What's more, these emissions are on the rise. As trees are cut down to make way for cows and pasture, and farming becomes more intensive, our emissions skyrocket &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/climate-change/smart-farming/liability/"&gt;Find out more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions trading and agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dairy industry is exempt from taking real action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions until 2015, when it may come under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Even then, the agriculture sector will be heavily subsidised by taxpayers, creating little incentive for farmers to reduce emissions and invest in solutions. Recent research shows that agriculture has some of the most cost-effective ways of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens if New Zealand agriculture doesn't lift its game?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the industry most reliant on a healthy environment and most at risk from the effects of climate change in New Zealand.    Agriculture generates the bulk of our export earnings and has an international reputation not only for quality products, but also for being clean and green. This image - along with the sector's economic sustainability - is under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 24 August 2012 – Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid responds to the first reading to the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading  (ETS)and Other Matters) Amendment Bill. The Bill will amend the Emissions Trading Scheme to that its purpose supports the Government's economic growth priorities more effectively.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“You really have to wonder if the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in this Government. The Government’s economic priorities are deep sea oil and digging up more coal -  the very cause of the emissions and the reason an ETS was developed in the first place.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Everybody wants a strong economy but this Government would have us all believe that more dirty, risky energy like deep sea oil is the only choice to get there. This is yet another example of the National-led Government killing off the opportunities we have to build a cleaner, safer 21st Century economy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government is hell-bent on re-writing environmental legislation simply to suit our biggest polluters at the cost of ordinary New Zealanders.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is a clear signal the Government is not taking environmental protection seriously and is putting our global reputation at risk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We need an energy strategy for the 21st century that phases out old dirty fuels that pollute our land, water and air and phase in new, clean and safe energy that can create thousands of jobs and strong economic growth for New Zealand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 27 August 2012 - The record melt of Arctic sea ice signals the urgency to replace fossil fuels with clean energy, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Preliminary figures released today from US National Snow and Ice Data Centre indicate that Arctic sea ice extent has passed the previous record low set in 2007. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This record is not the result of some freak of nature but the effect of man-made climate change caused by our reliance on dirty fossil fuels,”  says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This undeniable warning shot from the planet will accelerate the move away from fossil fuels.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year US$280 billion was invested in clean, safe energy. (2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boxer says the surge in clean energy investment means global emissions of greenhouse gases are close to hitting a peak and reducing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The fossil fuel industry is being consigned to history by the energy revolution occurring right now. The message is loud and clear – if you work for the fossil fuel industry start looking for job opportunities in the clean energy sector.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Globally, clean energy is a leading job creator. Nearly eight million jobs existed in clean energy in 2010. That figure is projected (3) to rise by another four million jobs within the next three years – eclipsing the number of jobs in all fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Meanwhile, New Zealand is missing the opportunity to share in the economic and jobs bonanza created by clean energy due to the Government passing laws to promote its fossil fuel agenda at the expense of clean energy,” says Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government's credibility on creating a prosperous 21st Century economy for New Zealand is disappearing faster than the Arctic sea ice. The Government's refusal to engage in the global clean energy race is costing this country tens of millions of dollars of missed business and jobs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In June this year Greenpeace launched a campaign to save the Arctic. So far, nearly one and a half million people have joined the to call for the Arctic to be designated an internationally protected region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Friday six activists, including Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo, boarded Gazprom’s ‘Prirazlomnaya’ Arctic oil platform, in the Pechora Sea, to demand that the Russian company abandon its dangerous Arctic oil drilling plans.

	Sea ice is frozen sea water that waxes and wanes in response to the cooling and
warming of the Arctic throughout the year. The ice pack reaches its greatest extent
at the end of the winter, during March, and its lowest point at the end of the
summer, usually in mid-September. This point is known as the sea ice minimum.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1970s scientists have been using satellites to monitor the amount&lt;br&gt;of Arctic sea ice present throughout the year. Data suggests that during this period&lt;br&gt;the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by around 3% every ten years but,&lt;br&gt;worryingly, they have discovered that the rate of melting has increased significantly&lt;br&gt;in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest ever sea ice minimum was in 2007, when the Arctic covered 4.13 million square kilometres on September 16th. The 2011 minimum was the second lowest on record and scientists are now suggesting that the extent of summer sea ice in 2012 could reach a new low.&lt;/p&gt;

	Wellington 6/5/12: Two days of hearings in the judicial review of the Government’s decision to award the Brazilian oil major Petrobras a permit to drill in the deep waters off the East Cape have concluded in Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The case was heard at the request of East Cape iwi Te Whanau a Apanui, and Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Crown and Petrobras presented their submissions today, following submissions yesterday from Greenpeace and Te Whanau a Apanui. These were based on evidence from a biologist, an expert on the global oil industry, and from Te Whanau a Apanui’s Rikirangi Gage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Crown's evidence is that the Minister of Energy did not consider the environment or our international obligations before issuing the permit. We think that speaks for itself,” says Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Rick Steiner, an Anchorage-based consultant who witnessed first-hand the effects of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon/Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, gave evidence on behalf of Greenpeace and Te Whanau a Apanui that the exploration phase is when most oil well blow-outs occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Deepwater Horizon was an exploratory well, and Petrobras’ permit allows just such a well to be drilled off the East Cape,” says Atkinson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile in Europe overnight, Greenpeace, the European Renewable Energy Council and the Global Wind Energy Council, released the ‘Energy [R]evolution Scenario 2012,’ on the potential of clean energy generation and efficiency technologies. The report was developed in conjunction with specialists from Germany’s Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Centre, the Dutch University of Utrecht, and more than 40 scientists and engineers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report predicts that by 2030, 65 per cent of energy industry jobs worldwide would be in clean energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It laid out a means to achieve a global reduction in CO2 emissions by 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, and for ending the exploitation of extreme sources of oil, whether they be in such places as the Arctic, or are accessible only through deep-water drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The alternatives to extreme oil are right here, right now,” says Atkinson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What’s more, New Zealand – with its expertise in geothermal, wind and hydro in particular – is well placed to export its know-how overseas,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After proceedings finished at the High Court in Wellington, the Honourable Justice Gandall reserved his decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Te Whanau a Apanui’s Dayle Takitimu says that the case was a challenge to mount, but that she says it has been worth the effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This was a technical legal action focused on the decision-making process for granting permits, and we remain hopeful that the outcome will show that was flawed in this case. We can now only hope that exploratory deep sea oil – which we know from the Deepwater Horizon is just so dangerous – never comes to the East Cape, or to the waters anywhere around this country,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Energy [R]evolution Scenario 2012 can be found here: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/energyrev2012/&lt;/p&gt;

	An Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) mill in Indonesia that produced paper used to make Cottonsoft-branded  toilet paper sold here in New Zealand has been exposed by a Greenpeace investigation as having regularly milled ramin, a rainforest species protected by both international and Indonesian law (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2011, many visits were made to APP’s Indah Kiat Perawang mill, Indonesia’s largest pulp mill, where numerous ramin logs were identified, mixed in with other rainforest species waiting to be pulped. Samples were taken from 46 of these logs and were confirmed to be ramin by the internationally-recognised Institute of Wood Technology and Wood Biology, vTI, at the University of Hamburg, Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year Greenpeace released the results of two rounds of independent testing that found that Cottonsoft-branded toilet paper, bought in a Wellington Countdown supermarket, contained rainforest fibres. The samples taken were made from paper from the Indah Kiat Perawang mill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace has caught Asia Pulp and Paper red-handed – this investigation shows APP’s main pulp mill is often riddled with illegal ramin. This makes a mockery of their public claim to have a ‘zero tolerance’ for illegal timber,” says Bustar Maitar, Head of the Forests Campaign for Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace mapping analysis shows that since the logging of ramin was banned in 2001, at least 180,000 hectares of Sumatran peat swamp forests have been cleared in concessions now controlled by APP – an area more than twice the size of New York City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These forests are a critical habitat for endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger, of which only 400 remain in the wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Independent testing and supply chain research into paper products from companies including Xerox and National Geographic show that they contain Indonesian rainforest fibre. These companies’ products were manufactured using paper from APP mills supplied by Indah Kiat Perawang, the same mill implicated in APP’s illegal ramin scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maitar continued: “APP is undermining the rule of law in Indonesia. Greenpeace is calling on the Government to immediately seize all illegal ramin in APP’s operations in Indonesia. The evidence has been provided to authorities to assist in their efforts to improve governance in the forest sector.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Climate campaigner Nathan Argent says: “APP, and Cottonsoft, its subsidiary, have once again been linked to rainforest clearance. It’s a fact: Buying Cottonsoft products helps fund habitat destruction, and contributes to the climate crisis,” says Argent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Any company buying from APP, such as Progressive Enterprises, the owners of the Countdown brand - should distance themselves from this scandal, and stop buying from APP or its subsidaries, until they clean up their act,” Argent says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace supports a ban on further clearance of peat swamp forests, as proposed in an official report on ramin protection by the Indonesian government department that is responsible for protecting ramin. APP’s sister company, the palm oil company GAR, is already implementing  a policy to end deforestation, including ending peat swamp forest clearance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The evidence that has been compiled by Greenpeace has been handed to the Ministry of Forestry and will also be passed to the police in Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;( 1 ) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES  http://www.cites.org/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companies including Kraft, Nestle, Adidas, Staples and Mattel have already suspended all purchases from APP and are implementing policies to avoid deforestation in their supply chains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Summary Report and the independent scientific results from tests on ramin logs can be found here: http://greenpe.ac/APP-Briefing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full findings and video footage from the investigation will be able to be viewed here later this (Thursday) evening:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.greenpeace.org/ramintrail .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an interview with Nathan Argent, call 021 971 234.

	Auckland September 20 2012: Scientists from the US Government’s National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) overnight released preliminary figures suggesting that Arctic sea ice has reached its lowest recorded extent since satellite records began to be kept in 1979. The data indicates that on September 16, the Arctic ice extent covered 3.41 million square kilometres - a drop of at least 45 per cent (on what is typical for this time of year) since records began (*).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The previous record low - set in 2007 - of 4.17 million square kilometres, was smashed in late August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic is crucial to maintaining a stable global climate, as snow and ice reflects sunlight back into space, in so doing cooling the planet.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo addressed a special event in New York alongside &lt;a href="http://350.org/"&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt; founder Bill McKibben to call for a coordinated international response to the Polar crisis. Responding to the news of the NSIDC’s announcement,  Naidoo said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Today's announcement represents a defining moment in human history. In just over 30 years we have altered the way our planet looks from space, and soon the North Pole may be completely ice free in summer.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Rather than dealing with the root causes of climate change the current response from our leaders is to watch the ice melt and then divide up the spoils.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “I hope that future generations will mark this day as a turning point, when a new spirit of global cooperation emerged to tackle the huge challenges we face. We must work together to protect the Arctic from the effects of climate change and unchecked corporate greed. This is now the defining environmental battle of our era”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dr Julienne Stroeve, a research scientist at the NSIDC, is currently aboard a Greenpeace ship in Svalbard, Norway, having just returned from conducting scientific research into the region’s record-breaking ice melt. She said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The loss of summer sea ice has led to unusual warming of the Arctic atmosphere, that in turn impacts weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere, that can result in persistent extreme weather such as droughts, heat waves and flooding.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Greenpeace is calling for the creation of a sanctuary in the uninhabited area around the North Pole and a ban on unsustainable industrial activity in the remainder of the Arctic.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Since June 2012 more than 1.8 million people have joined Greenpeace’s Save the Arctic campaign (&lt;a href="http://savethearctic.org/"&gt;savethearctic.org&lt;/a&gt;), and the group intends to place an ‘Arctic Scroll’ carrying these names on the seabed beneath the North Pole early next year as an act of opposition to corporate interest in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell announced on Monday (NZ time) that it had abandoned its plans to drill for oil in the Arctic this year. But the company still plans to do some preliminary drilling, in anticipation of returning next year.   &lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland, 3 September 2012 - Greenpeace New Zealand says it is appealing the Charities Commission ruling declining it charity status as a matter of principle.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, Greenpeace lawyers will ask the Court of Appeal, in Wellington, to overturn the Charities Commission decision declining it charity status when it applied in 2010. An appeal to the High Court over that ruling was unsuccessful in May last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid says the appeal has helped start a much needed debate about what it means to be a charity in the 21st Century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Charities Act was passed in 2005, but the courts, to date, have been applying English laws dating back to the 1600s. The public’s idea of charitable work today and what the courts have held so far is too far apart,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“At the heart of the challenge is whether Greenpeace’s work on nuclear disarmament is too ‘political’ and whether the amount and type of advocacy it does in support of environmental protection is too much to meet the test for a charity. How much is too much, is not clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This appeal raises the question whether New Zealand’s charities law will be in line with the Australian law, which allows charities freedom of expression in political debate as long as it is consistent with their charitable purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Whether we are successful or not in gaining charitable status, Greenpeace will continue to work in the same manner as we always have. We will always remain non-party political promoting good environmental outcomes supported by nearly 60,000 Kiwis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The High Court has upheld a series of decisions refusing organisations charitable status so an appeal to a higher court is needed to challenge the law they have been applying,” says McDiarmid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace supporters continue to be eligible for tax rebates on donations to Greenpeace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal is not expected to make a decision tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland 20/9/12: Greenpeace today hit back at Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley for his slight on those New Zealanders concerned about the Government’s rushed expansion of the fossil fuels sector in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mr Heatley was quoted in the Taranaki Daily News this morning as saying that these people “are not really New Zealand. They have concerns but they are not really middle-class New Zealand (sic)". (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oil on our beaches is a concern of many so-called ‘middle-class’ New Zealanders, and rightly so,” says Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And of course it should be pointed out that there are many people who may not meet Mr Heatley’s criteria for being ‘middle class,’ but who are still New Zealanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Minister Heatley has demonstrated that he is primarily interested in representing the interests of the oil industry, not those of New Zealanders, many of whom have sensible and legitimate concerns about the risks of deep sea oil drilling.  The dangers of deep sea oil are very real, and a threat to both our environment and our economy,” says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealanders saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and many directly experienced the impact of the relatively small Rena oil spill in the Bay of Plenty. That was a wake-up call for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heatley has just done a ‘Mitt Romney’ to all those New Zealanders with legitimate concerns about oil washing up on their beaches.  To refer to those New Zealanders as ‘not really New Zealand’, is like Mitt Romney writing off 47 per cent of US voters as not his concern,” (2) Abel says.   &lt;/p&gt;

	A third US retailer has announced it will not stock seafood from Antartica’s Ross Sea for environmental reasons, reports Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Harris Teeter joins US supermarket chains Safeway (1) and Wegmans (2) by taking the ‘Ross Sea Pledge’ which means it will not buy or sell seafood from that area. It is also calling for the entire Ross Sea to be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have pledged not to buy or sell any seafood harvested from the Ross Sea,” the company states on its website (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By taking the “Ross Sea Pledge,” we encourage the nations who are members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to designate the entire Ross Sea as an MPA [Marine Protected Area],” it continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ross Sea has been identified as the least human affected large oceanic ecosystem remaining on Earth (4).  Many Scientists are advocating for it to be designated as a fully protected marine reserve (5). However, a longline fishery for Antarctic toothfish, started by New Zealand vessels in the late 1990s, is operating in the Ross Sea and supplying the luxury market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The delicate balance of the fragile Ross Sea is under threat from commercial fishing,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although technology has made it possible, it is simply not sustainable to be fishing every last corner of our ocean. The Ross Sea is a special place that we should be protecting as the home to diverse and unique wildlife, and a refuge in the face of climate change – not exploiting to feed the wealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 Greenpeace published a report outlining the role that seafood traders, retailers and chefs can play in protecting the Ross Sea (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The announcement by Harris Teeter shows there is a growing awareness by retailers that the Ross Sea should be protected as no-go area,” says Thomas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently formed Antarctic Ocean Alliance (7), a group of environmental organisations, last week launched a report calling for a large-scale marine reserve to be established in the Ross Sea (8).&lt;/p&gt;

	A new analysis of the global power plant market launched by Greenpeace International shows that since the 1990s, installations of wind and solar grew faster than any other power plant technology. In addition, renewable energy expanded rapidly, to reach its biggest market share in 2010 and providing enough capacity to supply electricity to the equivalent of one third of Europe.

	John Key's Government has decided to turn its back on Kyoto to join an infamous club of the world's dirtiest economies and most belligerent climate wreckers, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Tim Grosser is trying dress up a profound decision to abandon the world’s longest standing collective agreement to tackle climate change as no big deal,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In fact, he has just joined New Zealand up to a club of the biggest and dirtiest polluters including Russia, USA and Canada.  You have to ask is that really where New Zealand belongs?  Is that how we see ourselves and is that how we want the world to see us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Perhaps most embarrassing and telling is that our nearest neighbour Australia, a latecomer to Kyoto and a massively coal dependent economy, is renewing its commitment to Kyoto. It is sending a clear signal that it is serious about climate change and that it wants to encourage a cleaner, smarter way of doing business. It is clear now that John Key does not want to do the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Right when the world is seeing ever more extreme weather events like Hurricane Sandy’s inundation of New York City during the US election, it is not the time to be diminishing commitment to global action on climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand stands to loose a lot more from being out of Kyoto than being in it.  This move backwards could do irreparable damage to our global standing and our economy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since coming to power, John Key has set about writing laws that  benefit our biggest polluters at the expense of our reputation and at the risk of the New Zealander lifestyle.  In this week alone the Government has killed off our only tool for tackling climate change - the ETS -  and announced it will open up our coastlines to dangerous deep water drilling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra has introduced supplementary feeds such as
imported palm-based animal feed which is changing
dairying from pastoral to industrial. Palm-based animal
feed imports have increased 2,700 fold since 1999. This is
part of an overall trend of intensification of dairying in New Zealand. Agriculture is responsible for 49% of NZ’s domestic
greenhouse gas emissions. This increase doesn’t factor in
indirect emissions from forest destruction in Indonesia to
grow supplementary feed for NZ’s dairy herds.

            Vega sailing from Manzanillo on her 3rd voyage to the French nuclear test site. Pacific.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand  was the second Greenpeace office established in 1974. It has a proud tradition  of leading, and winning environmental campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ played a key  role in stopping driftnet fishing on the high seas, in protecting Antarctica as  a World Park and in ending French nuclear testing in the Pacific. When the  Rainbow Warrior was bombed in Auckland Harbour in 1985, it didn’t just happen  to Greenpeace, it happened to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New  Zealand was officially founded in April 1974, but the story really began in  1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First protest voyage against Pacific nuclear testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the successful 1971 voyage to stop nuclear testing in Alaska, the newly  formed Greenpeace in Canada contacted the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  (CND) in New Zealand. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The new Greenpeace Canada  group was convinced that more non-violent direct action against nuclear testing  would make a difference.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In New Zealand CND had been campaigning against nuclear testing since 1962 and  was keen to progress the campaign. When they were contacted by Greenpeace  Canada they placed an appeal for a yacht on the front page of The New Zealand  Herald. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; At this time David McTaggart, by coincidence a Canadian, had recently sailed  into Auckland and saw the notice. He had no prior involvement with politics,  campaigning or the peace movement, but took up the challenge and agreed to take  his boat and a volunteer crew to the nuclear test zone.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The voyage was announced through the media and the group was inundated with  public support for the voyage. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They were hindered by some National Government bureaucracy, but on 27 April  1972 &lt;em&gt;Vega&lt;/em&gt; set sail. Renamed &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace III&lt;/em&gt; for the voyage, this  was the first protest voyage from New Zealand against nuclear weapons testing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Six weeks later they were in the test zone and their presence successfully  delayed (but did not stop) the French nuclear testing. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; McTaggart and crew thought that they had not achieved anything for the  campaign, but on their return to New Zealand they learnt that their  voyage had reached the media and the second fleet of protest boats was on the  way to the test zone.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The flotilla of three yachts heading for French Polynesia was assembled by the  Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and Peace Media. Greenpeace New Zealand  was born from these existing groups and people involved with the anti-nuclear  campaign.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; McTaggart sailed into the test zone again in 1973. He was beaten-up by the  French Navy, but this time managed to get the photos out to the world.  McTaggart went on to become the founder and Executive Director of Greenpeace  International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tackling international issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Greenpeace New Zealand was officially founded, New Zealanders were  actively campaigning on international issues. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It was a New Zealander, Paul Spong, who in 1973 convinced Greenpeace Vancouver  to campaign against the slaughter of whales. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Paul Spong set in motion a process that would transform Greenpeace from a  single-issue protest group into a broader peace and environmental organisation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In November 1979 members of Greenpeace New Zealand attended the first  Greenpeace international council meeting. David McTaggart, a powerful advocate  for New Zealand pushed for nuclear testing and other Pacific issues and the  possibility of an Antarctica campaign.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Campaigns opposing nuclear testing and whaling dominated Greenpeace New Zealand’s work throughout the 1970s. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The organisation and its supporter base expanded rapidly during the 1980s and  1990s to include successful campaigns and education on Antarctica, Forestry,  Oceans, Fisheries, Climate, and Toxics alongside its core Nuclear, Whaling, and  Pacific work.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is not and never has been “anti-farming”. In fact we see working with the land to produce food to feed people as one of the best professions around.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But we can’t keep farming the way we are if we want the best for our rivers, climate and farmers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re advocating a win-win way forward. It's called ecological farming. If the word “ecological” sounds too complicated, try “better”, “sustainable” or “smarter”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-14%20at%201.23.01%20pm.png" alt="" width="294" height="195"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eco-farming combines modern science and innovation with respect for nature and biodiversity. It protects the soil, water and climate. It ensures healthy farming and healthy food. It does not contaminate the environment with chemical inputs or use genetically engineered crops. It doesn’t put more stock on land than that land can sustain, it doesn’t use palm kernel as supplementary feed, and it doesn’t require irrigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eco-farming works with, rather than against, natural ecosystems - protecting and using them to improve soil and water health,control weeds, pests and diseases and create resilience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the ticket to healthy livestock, healthy crops, and healthy bottom lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0px 3px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/Agriculture/2016/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-14%20at%201.23.44%20pm.png" alt="" width="280" height="185"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies prove this. Here in New Zealand an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907005757"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AgResearch report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that a low-input system with less cows per hectare and no chemical nitrogen fertilizer produced the most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;milk per cow per year. The study also confirmed the low input system to be the best environmental performer, the least financially risky and is most profitable when milk-price payouts are low.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many New Zealand farmers are already &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/rural/251977/high-country-farmer-wins-award"&gt;switched on to this&lt;/a&gt;, rejecting high input intensive dairying and running profitable, low-input, environmentally-sound farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not just about dairying though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through ecological farming New Zealand could be producing clean, green, high-value food products across the board. This is what the world’s consumers are increasingly demanding - food with integrity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This election year, we’re encouraging voters to put two critical environmental issues on the political agenda. Here you’ll find advice on how exactly to do this - through attending candidate meetings and asking key questions of politicians. There are tips on what to ask, how to ask it, and how to locate events in your area.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1946659502244394/"&gt;&lt;img title="Two Big Questions " src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/2BigQs.jpg" alt="Two Big Questions" width="577" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s election season, and politicians are hitting the streets to reach out to their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the moment to bring the issues you care about to their attention. They want your vote, and right now you have the power to influence their policies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Now is the time to put the issues that matter on the agenda.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So many of the issues you and I care about - from protecting our precious rivers to preventing the worst effects of climate change - are in desperate need of political leadership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It’s really important we work together to get critical environmental issues on the map when our representatives are at their most accessible. Issues like protecting our rivers from dirty dairying and saving our climate from dangerous fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Politicians love to use fancy rhetoric to make their position look good no matter what it is. New Zealand politicians are particularly adept at doing this when it comes to the issues that are most concerning for our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Oil" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/Russel123.png" alt="Oil" width="588" height="259"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do we get past the superficial slogans and force politicians to address the real issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The best way is to show up and get in front of your candidate at a public meeting and ask a pointed yes/no question. Yes/no questions force candidates to divert from their script and state a clear position, on record, in response to your issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Repetition is important. The more your message is heard, the more likely it is to be remembered should your aspiring candidate be elected into Parliament. And with hundreds of people asking the same questions of candidates across the country, our message is highly likely to make its way back to Party HQ, where the policies are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Too Many Cows " src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/toomanycows.jpg" alt="Too Many Cows " width="586" height="278"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get beyond the slogans this election. With your help we can force our aspiring political representatives to consider the most important environmental issues of our time and carry a strong sense of public momentum with them into Parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Whether at a public meeting or on your doorstep - these are the questions critical to New Zealand’s future:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 1.) Scientists tell us most of the world’s fossil fuels need to stay in the ground if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change. Do you agree we need to stop looking for new oil immediately?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 2.) The National Government has just agreed to $480 million to fund big irrigation schemes. More irrigation means more cows and more cows mean more polluted rivers. Will your party stop subsidising big irrigation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to start?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up to our &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1946659502244394/"&gt;‘Two Big Questions’ Facebook group here&lt;/a&gt; and introduce yourself. This way you can connect with others in your area too and attend meetings together if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite family and friends to join the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research local candidate events in your area where you can ask questions. There are several ways to do this: Check political party web pages for events,  talk to your local council about events &amp;amp; check the Facebook pages of individual candidates for events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve tracked a local event down - share it on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1946659502244394/"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; so others can come along too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have time - check out the relevant Party’s policy on the issues, there’s a summary at the bottom of this page. You don’t need to be an expert, but it can help you feel more confident if you’ve read up a little beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;At the event&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re meeting with others, it’s a good idea to organise a place to meet beforehand so you can get an idea of who’s asking what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider bringing along a camera or recording device - so you can get video of the candidate’s response if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go prepared, be fair, and listen to their reasons for agreeing or not agreeing with you immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have the chance ask your question, try the two listed above first. If there’s time to ask more questions, make sure you ask a question they can only answer yes or no to. Politicians are used to sidelining questions; forcing them to say yes or no is the most surefire way to get a straight answer on the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't beat around the bush. Briefly state your argument and then ask them your yes/no question. If they don’t answer it directly, ask them again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay calm. Raising your voice or getting angry at the candidate(s) is not a good idea. You will be more persuasive (to both the candidate(s) and the audience) by coming across as knowledgeable, reasonable, and passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re here for support. If you want more advice or information, want to share footage of your candidate’s answer or get further involved, just drop us an email at &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/new-zealand/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/84205b0682baaeac78f7889f0956ebc4.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Election 2017: Party Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does each political party say on the two key issues? Many of their election 2017 policies have not been released yet, but we've put together some info that might illustrate what's been said so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This information is by no means exhaustive - it is meant as a summary only. Please click through to the links to read further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent information is that National will not ban deep sea oil exploration. The NZ Government’s current energy strategy, developed with National at the helm, actually suggests the opposite, with the Government wanting New Zealand to be a “highly attractive global destination for petroleum exploration.” &lt;a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/documents-image-library/nz-energy-strategy-lr.pdf"&gt;You can read more on this here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent information is that National won’t scrap public subsidies for irrigation. The Party’s &lt;a href="https://www.national.org.nz/helping_rural_communities"&gt;Helping Rural Communities Policy&lt;/a&gt; states the opposite, that they want to boost irrigation and that they’re investing $400 million over time to support regional irrigation projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent information says the Party won’t ban deep sea oil but will focus on better safety measures. &lt;a href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/labour-axe-irrigation-scheme-fund-backs-deep-sea-oil-bd-155702"&gt;In 2014, then deputy Labour leader David Parker said the Party would continue to support deep sea oil drilling,&lt;/a&gt; but that they would develop a rapid response capability for if an incident occurs. He added the Labour Party would stop undertaking publicly funded geological survey work that aimed to locate new areas of oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This August, &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/336839/labour-water-tax-will-open-a-can-of-worms-fed-farmers"&gt;Labour announced they would scrap public subsidies for irrigation.&lt;/a&gt; They will also charge for the commercial use of water and recycle the revenues back to regional councils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ask more questions" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/jonathan-simcoe-88013.jpg" alt="Ask more questions" width="577" height="475"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up to date information says the Green party is committed to banning deep sea oil. They would also introduce a moratorium on fracking. &lt;a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/page/energy-policy"&gt;View their Energy policy here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information says they will scrap public subsidies for irrigation. &lt;a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/news/press-release/freshwater-improvement-fund-can-also-be-used-pollute-waterways"&gt;According to a 2016 press release:&lt;/a&gt; “The Green Party will put a moratorium on dairy conversions, stop government subsidies for irrigation, support tangata whenua participation and leadership in resolving water issues, and prevent wastewater and stormwater pollution through a range of measures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NZ First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information suggests they won’t ban deep sea oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information says they won’t scrap public subsidies for irrigation. NZ First’s &lt;a href="http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/primary_industries"&gt;Primary Industries policy&lt;/a&gt; is to: “Assist the farming sector to continue enhancing environmental sustainability, and support on-going development of sustainably managed irrigation schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="_Tgc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Māori&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information suggests they will not introduce an outright ban on deep sea oil. Māori party policy is to leave the decision about whether to allow oil drilling and mining up to iwi and hapu. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaoriParty/photos/a.225433844134443.67647.194480190563142/698206346857188/?type=1&amp;amp;theater"&gt;The Māori party would “promote robust consultation with mana whenua for all oil and mineral exploration permits.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information suggests they could be persuaded to scrap public subsidies for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marama Fox has been outspoken against the Government’s &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/307851/stream-water-should-be-drinkable-fox"&gt;weak water quality standards in the past&lt;/a&gt;. 2017 policies still to be announced. &lt;a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/maoriparty/pages/27/attachments/original/1469676454/Maori-Party-Policy-2014.pdf?"&gt;Latest policy from 2014 &lt;/a&gt;is “&lt;em&gt;The Māori Party established Te Mana o Te Wai - the health and well-being of our water - as a driving policy for freshwater management.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Voting" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/arnaud-jaegers-253360.jpg" alt="Voting" width="585" height="401"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most up-to-date info says they won’t ban deep sea oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.org.nz/conservation-and-the-environment/"&gt;Most up-to-date info says they won’t scrap public subsidies for irrigation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1707/S00445/hurunui-water-project-shows-vulnerability-of-property-rights.htm"&gt;David Seymour has spoken out against compulsory land acquisition for the Hurunui Water Project irrigation scheme.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;United Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information suggests they won’t ban deep sea oil, choosing instead to focus on safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position unclear. Their policy does not include specific mention of irrigation. According to their &lt;a href="http://unitedfuture.org.nz/freshwater/"&gt;Freshwater policy,&lt;/a&gt; “We would introduce a coherent royalties regime put in place that would attach a price to water when it is taken (like there is for oil and gas).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Opportunities Party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information suggests they won’t introduce an outright ban on deep sea oil. However, their policy could indirectly limit further oil development. Their climate change policy includes a target of weaning the country off fossil fuels by 2050 and “[e]nsur [ing] all large new investments take into account our low carbon future.” &lt;a href="http://www.top.org.nz/top6"&gt;Climate Change Policy is here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most up-to-date information says they will scrap public subsidies for irrigation. The main crux of their policy is: Impose a resource rental on all commercial uses of water Polluters should pay for their pollution Resolving Treaty rights claims over water. &lt;a href="http://www.top.org.nz/top9"&gt;View their Clearwater Action Plan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As the deadline for submissions on Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee’s Draft Energy Strategy draws to a close (at 5pm Thursday), Greenpeace is telling the Government that it is not too late to embrace the global Clean Energy revolution – in fact the timing’s perfect.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It is clear from Mr Brownlee’s energy strategy, which reads like a love letter to fossil fuels - he even once described coal as ‘sexy ' - that he has missed the fact that we are about to trigger a state of runaway climate change,“ says Greenpeace Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In his 19th century-style rush to cash up New Zealand’s mineral reserves, Gerry Brownlee is also risking a Gulf of Mexico-style oil disaster, which would destroy our invaluable clean green reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But he’s also in danger of letting New Zealand miss out on an extraordinary opportunity,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With global investment in Clean Energy eclipsing fossil fuels for the second year in a row - President Obama has pledged US$69 billion (NZ$98 billion) on Clean Energy initiatives by the end of 2011 - the time’s ripe for New Zealand to harness its abundant renewable energy, smart ideas and scientific know-how to put Kiwi companies at the front of the clean technology race and grow New Zealand’s prosperity in the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of trying to resuscitate the fossil fuel industry, why not give a leg-up to those home grown innovators who will help define the future? What if Richard Pearce – the kiwi aviation pioneer - had been better supported? The world would celebrate his name instead of the Wright Brothers.  Many other equally brilliant kiwi innovators will wither on the vine under this Government’s stewardship,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, in backing Clean Energy innovation we’ll stand a good chance of making the sort of cuts to our emissions that are essential if the world is to avoid a state of runaway climate change,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of New Zealand’s Clean Energy companies include Designline International, who are producing revolutionary hybrid turbine buses; Windflow Technology, who are designing some of the world’s most efficient wind turbine technologies; and HTS 110, who are designing world-class, super-efficient systems for transmitting renewable energy. All are examples of the sort of ingenuity for which this country is justifiably famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday afternoon, Greenpeace supporters had made in excess of 3388 submissions on the Energy Strategy, calling on the Government to abandon coal and oil in favour of a Clean Energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/Greenpeace-submission-to-the-Governments-Draft-Energy-Strategy-Consultation-NZES-2010/" target="_self"&gt;Read the Greenpeace submission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Our activists are suspended 15 meters above the frigid Arctic waters of Baffin Bay. They have taken up position on the drilling rig Stena Don to call for a ban on deep sea oil drilling in the Arctic, and demand that ‘wild cat’ oil company Cairn energy stop drilling, pack up and go home. The banner? “Hands off the Arctic, go beyond oil!”

            Climbers occupy Cairn Energy oil rig in the Arctic
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early this morning, our climbers left the Esperanza and headed out into  the misty Arctic waters of Baffin Bay, off Greenland, and headed  straight for the drilling rig, which is being operated by a British  company Cairn Energy. They had to outrun Danish Navy commandos before  climbing up the inside of the rig and hanging from it in tents suspended  from ropes. They have enough supplies to stay in their hanging tents  for several days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they are able to halt the drilling for just a  short time, Cairn Energy will struggle to meet a tight deadline to  complete its exploration before winter ice conditions force it to  abandon the search for oil off Greenland until next year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  Esperanza, has been anchored between the Stena Don rig and Stena Forth  drill ship, which are 20 miles apart, for nine days now. A Danish  Thetis-class warship has stayed in close vicinity throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v5.aspx?Id=18701&amp;amp;ThemeId=602" style="border: 1px solid #000000;" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragile environment west of Disko Island is known as Iceberg Alley  due to the plentiful icebergs and tough conditions. This has deterred  oil companies from attempting exploration there in recent years, but the  world’s oil giants are watching the Cairn project with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Cairn is successful the Arctic could be flooded with oil  companies, all trying to operate in hazardous polar conditions. Analysts  are expecting a whole new Arctic oil rush, with Exxon, Chevron and  other energy giants already buying up licenses to drill in the area. The  implications for the area, which has populations of blue whales, polar  bears, seals and migratory birds, could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this has to happen. We have the great chance to go beyond oil  by launching an Energy Revolution, ending fossil fuel subsidies,  increasing the support for clean energy and launching strong laws and  policies that limit global warming pollution – all that is needed is the  political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Zealand also under threat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the New Zealand Government has announced plans to open massive tracts of our oceans to offshore oil drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Gerry Browlee has already permitted dangerous deep sea oil exploration directly off the East  Coast of the North Island, and tagged many other areas in New Zealand's  waters for further oil exploration soon to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the proposal to open our best conservation land for mining, new  oil exploration in NZ waters is a move in the wrong direction for New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion of oil and coal extraction threatens our unique  environment, the climate and the clean and green reputation that  underpins New Zealand's economy. Our Government is struggling to  understand the urgent need for a new economic vision. New Zealand  deserves a clean energy vision from our Government. In the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/reports/energy-r-evolution-a-sustain/"&gt;Energy  [R]evolution&lt;/a&gt; report Greenpeace has shown that this can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

	If you've ever wanted to take the wheel of the Esperanza to thread your way through Iceberg Ally in the Arctic -- as it's doing now to highlight risks of deepwater drilling -- or sail the Rainbow Warrior into close quarters with a ship dumping radioactive waste, or blast through heavy surf in a Greenpeace inflatable to block a harpoon, now you can -- without ever getting wet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/PageFiles/126394/shipsim4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="339"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it all from your PC, thanks to software manufacturer VSTEP. They're the folks behind Ship Simulator (think Flight Simulator,  and add water) which a half a million salty cyberdogs already play (including quite a few of our own captains, mates, and deckhands). Their new release, out  soon, will be called Ship Simulator Extremes -- and we're in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="petition" class="petition" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;a id="hlPetition" class="btn-petition" style="text-decoration:none" title="Buy the Donation Edition of the Game" href="http://www.shipsim.com/"&gt;&lt;span id="spanPetition"&gt;Buy the Donation Edition of the Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 32 realistically rendered vessels in the game, from Oil Tankers to Hovercraft, and among them are our own Greenpeace ships Esperanza and the yet-to-be-built Rainbow Warrior III  -- in game sequences based on actual past actions at sea. The ships are all meticulously rendered from blueprints, CAD drawings, and photos to behave like actual simulators.  There's also a Rigid Hulled Boat, or RHB -- the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/about/ships/our-inflatables/"&gt;legendary Billy G&lt;/a&gt; -- which you can launch from the deck and blast through the waves.  You can take them in and out of accurately recreated ports.  You can control variables like wind speed, wave height, weather, and daylight to customize your adventure. You can create your own missions to upload for other players, and when you successfully complete a Greenpeace mission you unlock video of one of our captains describing how it really went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, when you buy the donation version of game &lt;a href="http://www.shipsim.com/"&gt;(you can pre-order it now, nudge nudge, link, link&lt;/a&gt;) 20 percent of the proceeds go to &lt;a href="https://secure.flo2cash.co.nz/donations/greenpeace/rw/donate.aspx?v=2&amp;amp;a=2&amp;amp;mo=2&amp;amp;nl=2"&gt;building the REAL Rainbow Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and gets you a chance to win a trip on one of her first voyages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sneak peak of what the game play looks like. Pop it up full screen to read the mission information upper left.&lt;/p&gt;

	Following a seminal study by top marine scientists in 2001, which reported that global seafood catches had been declining since the 1980s, the news about the state of the world’s fish stocks became progressively worse.

            Oceans Advocates - October 2010
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;In 2004 the British journalist Charles Clover published his book The End of the Line, detailing the impacts of destructive and wasteful fishing around the world.
&lt;p&gt;By this point it should have been more than clear to politicians that the crisis in the world’s oceans could no longer be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the decisions they made were persistently based on the short-term profit interests of influential fishing industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With billions of people relying on healthy oceans to ensure their food security and livelihoods, it was essential that new powerful voices could be heard, driving the change that would see fisheries becoming sustainable and our oceans getting the protection they need. To make this all happen a new approach was necessary – starting at the customer-facing end of the seafood chain: the retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is condemning dairy giant Fonterra’s weak ‘claim’ that “it believes” its palm kernel animal feed comes from sustainable sources.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The wording was contained in a Fonterra statement released this afternoon, which was prompted by Greenpeace entering Fonterra’s corporate headquarters in Auckland this morning to communicate to the company’s staff the damage done by the cultivation of palm kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra’s statement speaks of the palm products industry as being one which “we &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; follow[s] industry best practice in responsible sourcing.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That statement shows quite clearly that Fonterra does not know where its palm kernel comes from,” says Greenpeace Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fonterra does not present its claims of sustainability as fact because it knows the basic maths would prove any such claim a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil – an industry governed body – concedes that only six per cent of the world’s palm kernel is grown sustainably. But almost a quarter of the world’s palm kernel trade ends up on Fonterra’s farms - making Fonterra’s claims an impossibility,” says Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The overseas palm industry describes palm kernel as being one of its three main products, a far cry from Fonterra’s ‘byproduct of a byproduct’ argument. Further, a recent Fonterra carbon-footprint report describes palm kernel expeller as representing 13 per cent of the value of all palm products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fonterra’s statement on the sustainability of its feed is completely undermined by palm industry figures that show that NZ$230 million – the value of the feed New Zealand buys – is likely to end up in the pockets of the companies carrying out the sort of destruction Greenpeace’s documentation team found in Indonesia last weekend,” Boxer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest edition of the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics shows significant separation between companies that are failing to keep their environmental commitments and those that are making significant gains in phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing energy efficiency, and making it easier for consumers to recycle older products.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The full Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics can be viewed at; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/electronics-guide" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/electronics-guide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace applauds Philips for releasing the first TV free of PVC and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The Econova TV puts Philips on track to meet its commitment to phase out these hazardous substances by the end the year, well ahead of other TV manufacturers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a growing gulf between companies that are consistently innovating and leading by releasing greener products and companies that just make big promises,” said Greenpeace New Zealand Communications Manager Suzette Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By launching a PVC and BFR-free TV, Philips has overcome the technical hurdles to removing these toxic substances from this product group – there is now no excuse for other TV manufacturers not to follow”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New products free of PVC and BFRs (1) have been put on the shelves by Acer, the Indian companies Wipro and HCL, and HP, which now has several lines of notebooks, desktops and, most recently, a PVC-free printer. In contrast, Toshiba, LGE, Samsung, Dell and Lenovo have no whole PC product lines free from these substances.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba is served a second penalty point this year for misleading its customers about its commitments and a first penalty point is imposed on Microsoft for backtracking on commitments to remove these toxic substances. Several other companies continue to be weighed down by penalty points for failing to meet their phase out commitments, including LGE, Samsung, Dell and Lenovo (2). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Sony Ericsson remain well ahead in 1st and 2nd place for producing products free of the most hazardous substances, including PVC/BFRs, antimony, beryllium, and phthlates. HP, Samsung and Lenovo are the biggest climbers in this edition. Samsung climbs to 5th place from 13th, despite retaining a penalty points for backtracking on its commitment to eliminate PVC and BFRs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple takes the biggest drop, not because it has lost any points but because several other companies have overtaken it. LGE and Toshiba, both previously amongst the leaders, now take 14th and 16th place, showing that in this fast moving and innovative sector that standing still is just not good enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scores on Waste and Recycling show the least progress overall, Panasonic is rewarded for initiating voluntary take-back and recycling of its TVs in India, the first programme of its kind for TVs outside the OECD and another first for TVs. However, the industry, as a whole, is failing to expand current take-back programmes to achieve global reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Panasonic is stepping up to the challenge of taking responsibility for its end-of-life TVs – but further company initiatives to take-back and recycle e-waste outside the developed world are desperately needed,” said Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panasonic’s programme could jump start this process. These encouraging developments on both greener products and e-waste are welcome. It’s unfortunate that they also highlight the lack of ambition of those that lag behind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in circuit boards and plastic casings, do not break down easily and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure can lead to impaired learning and memory functions. They can also interfere with thyroid and oestrogen hormone systems and exposure in the womb has been linked to behavioural problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a plastic used in some electronics products and for insulation on wires and cables. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when PVC is produced or disposed of by incineration (or simply burning). These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and many are toxic even in very low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Toshiba, Samsung, LGE, Dell and Lenovo continue to be penalised in this latest version of the Guide for backtracking on their commitments to phase out PVC and BFRs. Toshiba is served with a further penalty point for misleading its customers and Greenpeace by not admitting that it would not meet its commitment.  In addition, Microsoft is served with a penalty point for the first time for backtracking on its commitment to phase out PVC and BFRs by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest edition of the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics exposes the widening gap between companies that make good on their promises to clean up, and those that don't. While some of the top electronics manufacturers are failing to keep their environmental commitments, others are innovating and making significant gains in phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing energy efficiency, and making it easier for consumers to recycle old products.

&lt;h3&gt;Greener TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applaud &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; for releasing the first TV free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The &lt;em&gt;Econova TV&lt;/em&gt; puts Philips on track to meet its commitment to phase out these  hazardous substances by the end the year, well ahead of other TV  manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing gulf between companies that are consistently  innovating and leading by releasing greener products and companies that  just make big promises and excuses. As they say in the software  business: you've either shipped or you haven't.  By launching a PVC- and  BFR-free TV, Philips has overcome the technical hurdles to removing  these toxic substances from this product group. There is now no excuse  for other TV manufacturers not to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a1"&gt;The dangers of PVC and BFRs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some BFRs, used in circuit boards and plastic casings, do not break  down easily and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure can  lead to impaired learning and memory functions. They can also interfere  with thyroid and oestrogen hormone systems and exposure in the womb has  been linked to behavioural problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC is a plastic used in some electronics products and for insulation  on wires and cables. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when  PVC is produced or disposed of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/multimedia/photo-essays/Scraplife---e-waste-in-Pakistan/"&gt;by incineration (or simply burning)&lt;/a&gt;. These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and many are toxic even in very low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a2"&gt;Lots more PVC- and BFR-free products&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New products free of PVC and BFRs have been put on the shelves by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Acer/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian companies Wipro and HCL, and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/HP/"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, which now has several lines of notebooks, desktops and most recently a PVC-free printer. In contrast, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Toshiba/"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/LG/"&gt;LGE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Samsung/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Dell/"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Lenovo/"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; still have no whole PC product lines free from these substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba is served a second penalty point this year for misleading its  customers about its commitments and a first penalty point is imposed on  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for backtracking on commitments to remove these toxic substances.  Several other companies continue to be weighed down by penalty points  for failing to meet their phase out commitments, including LGE, Samsung,  Dell and Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple takes the biggest drop, not because it has lost any points but  because several other companies have overtaken it. LGE and Toshiba, both  previously amongst the leaders, now take 14th and 16th place, showing  that in this fast moving and innovative  sector that standing still is  just not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scores on Waste and Recycling show the least progress  overall, Panasonic is rewarded for initiating voluntary take-back and  recycling of its TVs in India, the first programme of its kind for TVs  outside the OECD and another first for TVs. However, the industry as a  whole is failing to expand current take-back programmes to achieve  global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panasonic is stepping up to the challenge of taking responsibility  for its end-of-life TVs – but further company initiatives to take-back  and recycle e-waste outside the rich world are desperately needed;  Panasonic’s programme could jump start this process.&lt;/p&gt;

	Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, known as the Tokyo Two, exposed widespread corruption in Japan's whaling programme - in return, they have been handed a one year suspended prison sentence. (This means they do not have to go to jail).

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the harsh punishment the two anti-whaling activists stood in court as heroes today, having successfully put whaling on trial, both in court, and in Japan's national media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the verdict Junichi said, "While the court acknowledged that there were questionable practices in the whaling industry, it did not recognise the right to expose these, as is guaranteed under international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on which our defence was based, supersedes domestic criminal law, but the judgment did not properly take this into account." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This sentence is totally disproportionate and completely undeserved," added Toru. "We set out to reveal the truth about the government's whaling programme, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is appealing this totally unjust, politically motivated sentence. Junichi and Toru have taken great personal risks to investigate and expose embezzlement at the heart of Japan's tax-funded whaling industry.  They intercepted one of numerous boxes of whale meat embezzled from the whaling programme as evidence. These boxes were taken for private use by the crew of the Nisshin Maru in violation of the whaling programme's regulations, and this amounts to a misuse of public funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of investigating and arresting those behind the whale meat embezzlement scandal, Junichi and Toru were detained arbitrarily, forced to live under onerous bail conditions and put on trial. After more than two-years of political prosecution the court has convicted them of "theft" and "trespass", while the criminals behind the whale meat embezzlement walk free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/oceans/whales/japan/whale-meat-scandal/Key-Tokyo-Two-trial-facts/"&gt;You can read the key facts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conviction is a slap in the face for those that expose inconvenient truths and the misuse of public funds. It's bad news for the entire political culture in Japan, not least the role of NGOs in society; there is little doubt that the ruling signifies a major step backwards for the country's aim of gaining international reliability. More broadly this conviction is part of a disturbing trend of authorities meeting peaceful and civil dissent with harsh and disproportionately severe punishments. Sentences such as the one that has been given to Junichi and Toru today create a chilling effect in society. They narrow the democratic space and discourage people from speaking out, with impacts for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- START QUOTE --&gt;
&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy. The freedom to peacefully expose wrongdoing is not only a crucial part of any democracy, it is a right that must be defended. Greenpeace will continue to make this case a global priority until this unjust conviction is" &lt;span class="lastword"&gt;overturned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- END QUOTE --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists are always prepared to take responsibility for their actions, and standing up in court for what we believe in is often a result of taking appropriate, peaceful action. However, it is unacceptable for the authorities to ignore human rights and freedom of expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Japan has already &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/opinion-of-the-unhrc/" target="_blank"&gt;drawn criticism from the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention&lt;/a&gt; for its treatment of Junichi and Toru, and as Professor Dirk Voorhoof, an international law expert and defence witness in the case, said: "This conviction is very likely to earn Japan more criticism for its failure to respect its obligations under international human rights law." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Junichi and Toru are not alone in facing this verdict. Vigils are being held at Japanese embassies around the world and hundreds of thousands of people have already signed our petition calling for justice. In addition the Toyo Two's case has already been taken up by Amnesty International, by Nobel Laureates including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and by celebrities like Bryan Adams and Benicio Del Torro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the Tokyo Two trial a lot has also happened to shift public perceptions in Japan. Industry whistleblowers have continued to speak with Japanese media about corruption and wrongdoing in the whaling industry, interest in the story keeps growing, and in the last fortnight alone articles in major newspapers such as Tokyo Shimbun and Kyodo have closely examined the issue. The headlines include "the trial of whale meat theft exposes horrifying realities" and "Scientific Whaling is diverting to illegal channels after all". Japanese journalists are also not just increasingly interested in what's going on in the tax-funded whaling programme, but in what the Tokyo Two trial has to say on the question of freedom of expression and NGO rights in their country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're standing with Junichi and Toru all the way and will make sure as many people as possible hear their story - and the positive impact their brave action is having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can stand by Junichi and Toru along with us - &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Activism-is-not-a-crime-Write-to-Japans-Foreign-Minister/"&gt;send an e-mail to Japan's Foreign Minister now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Oil-smeared’ people walked through central Wellington today to protest Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee’s reckless determination to dig and drill for more dirty fossil fuels while ignoring the impacts on climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the close of submissions on the Review of the Crown Minerals Act(1) Greenpeace supporters delivered its submission in dramatic style covering themselves in fake oil (molasses and water) to mimic the impact of a crude oil spill on New Zealand shores. The Greenpeace submission, along with an ongoing petition which has more than 18,000 signatures, calls for the Government to stop the development of new oil and coal reserves and to start investing in building a clean economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By declaring open season on our oil reserves, the Government is playing Russian roulette with our pristine coastlines, our international reputation and the climate,” says Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The climate crisis is close to tipping point and it is irresponsible to be prospecting for new reserves of fossil fuels. New Zealand should be on the side of pioneering real progress towards a clean and sustainable energy future rather than being shackled to Gerry Brownlee’s 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century way of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that many of the reserves are in extreme areas - like up to 3000 metres under the Raukumara Basin off the spectacular East Cape of the North Island – will push the technology to the limits and it would be near impossible to prevent a catastrophe if something went wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fossil fuel era ends the clean technology industry is experiencing rapid global growth. Investment in clean energy has eclipsed that of fossil fuels for the second year running by attracting US$140bn compared with US$110bn for gas, coal and nuclear power.(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argent says the Minister for Energy and Resources has prioritised investment in fossil fuels by spending over $20 million of taxpayer’s money prospecting on behalf of overseas oil companies, whilst spending just one per cent of this figure on investment in biofuels projects.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Government is genuinely trying to achieve sustainable, economic prosperity and energy security, it should build on our position as a global leader in clean renewable energy and provide greater support and investment in companies like Wellington based HTS 110 who are designing world class, super efficient systems for transmitting renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, in backing clean energy innovation we’ll stand a good chance of making the sort of cuts to our emissions that are essential if the world is to avoid a state of runaway climate change,” concluded Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Smith Maori activist representative of the Tuanuku Climate Change Network joined the protest said drilling off the East Coast of New Zealand “was environmental insanity”.&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite the central billing given to sustainability at this year’s World Dairy Summit, it is clear that to Fonterra this relates to profits and growth, not the future of the planet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace sent a delegate to the summit, Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent, in the hope that some serious discussion would take place on how the dairy industry could play a positive role in the fight against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was disappointing to see that despite the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the dairy sector, the summit was just another talking shop in the dairy calendar. There was more interest in exchanging business cards, protecting costs structures and expanding networks than putting the planet before profit,” says Argent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems obvious that Fonterra are more interested in telling a good story and becoming better at green washing than they are in being part of the solution to climate change. And the proof is in the pudding. How can Fonterra claim to be serious about sustainability when they’re involved in the unsustainable trade in palm kernel and powering their milk plants with dirty fossil fuels?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whilst other countries and farmers are rising to meet the challenges ahead, Fonterra's leadership seems determined to protect its business interests and image, rather than the environment it pretends to be a custodian of.” &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is supporting tough new rules to regulate industrial tuna fishing in the Pacific Ocean and is advocating for the closure of four areas of international waters to all fishing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It says Pacific tuna fisheries are in jeopardy of being overfished and that measures such as the closure of the four areas of international waters are vital to ensure the sustainability of what was considered to be the last relatively healthy tuna fishery in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues are being discussed by the body responsible for managing the western Pacific region’s tuna resource – the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in Pohnphei, Federated States of Micronesia, which starts today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of Pacific Island countries, along with Australia, are calling for the closure of four areas of international water to all fishing by the end of 2010. (1) There is also a call to ban fish aggregation devices (FADs), which act like a magnet to fish, in purse seine fishing.   Greenpeace New Zealand Ocean campaigner Karli Thomas, who is at this meeting, says New Zealand must support these moves.   “It’s a David and Goliath battle between the small Pacific nations and industrial fishing fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand can help even up the odds by supporting our neighbours to stop overfishing of the Pacific tuna fishery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Pacific tuna stocks are in serious trouble already - last year scientists advised that fishing pressure needed to be cut by up to half to allow bigeye tuna to recover from overfishing. Fishing with deadly FADs is a major cause of this decline along with pirate fishing and the overcapacity of fishing fleets.” (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Greenpeace released a report which shows more than half of the Taiwanese vessels operating in Pacific waters are evading their own national laws by reflagging to another country usually one of the Pacific islands, a practice known as  flag of convenience (FOC). (3) This gives them the fishing and access rights of the flagged state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also documents 16 cases of pirate fishing linked to Taiwan industry in 2009 and 2010. Taiwan is a member of the WCPFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bloated Taiwanese fleet operates predominantly in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and has a history of being involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) or pirate fishing activities,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Commission members, including the Pacific Island countries, are obligated to implement tougher regulations to address the urgent situation by keeping a close tab on the number of fishing vessels that its local registered industry are authorised to operate. As an urgent action Pacific states must move away from being used as flag of convenience states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rogue fleets that avoid regulations engage in pirate fishing and wasteful fishing practices should be the first to be booted from the region. It’s also time that the big contributors to destructive and overfishing in the Pacific such as Taiwan, Japan, Korea, US as well as Indonesia and the Philippines begin to seriously reduce their fishing capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for sustainable and equitable fisheries and a global network of marine reserves to cover 40 per cent of our oceans – area off limits to harmful fishing, and mining, drilling and other extractive activities. With marine reserves, our oceans and fish stocks can begin to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

	Genetic engineering in our food and environment is unnecessary, unpredictable and poses serious threats to ecosystems and risks to our health.

&lt;p&gt;What is genetic engineering? Genetic engineering (GE) is when genes from plants, animals or bacteria are inserted into plants or animals in a laboratory to create new organisms that would not occur naturally. Using GE, genes from bacteria, viruses, plants and animals have been inserted into soya beans, canola, corn and cotton. These “genetically modified organisms” or “GMOs” are now being used in the food we buy.&lt;/p&gt;

	Climate change is Greenpeace’s number one global priority. It’s the greatest environmental threat that humanity has ever faced. Unchecked it will adversely affect human society and the world’s biodiversity on an unprecedented scale.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 3px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/climate/2010/climate-fact-sheet-thumb.jpg" alt="Download" width="200" height="282"&gt;Not one scientific body of national or international standing dissents from the view that human activity is causing the climate to change.

	The 7th meeting of the WCPFC has the opportunity to show global leadership in precautionary and ecosystem-based tuna management by agreeing to implement a number of key measures that will address the deepening crisis facing the regions tuna stocks from overfishing and fleet overcapacity.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These measures will need to build on and complement the actions that have been taken multilaterally by the WCPFC or unilaterally by the Parties to the Nauru agreement (PNA), that so far have not been far-reaching enough to avert an impending fisheries crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the WCPFC Scientific Committee (SC) reported that measures agreed in 2008 do not go far enough to halt overfishing in the region, and the crisis facing especially bigeye and yellowfin stocks continues to deepen. Bigeye tuna spawning biomass is now at 17% of its original biomass1 – very close to the level that would make it eligible for listing under the Convention protecting species threatened by international trade, CITES, as was recently the case with Atlantic bluefin tuna – the poster child of poor fisheries management. Signs of decline in even the once robust skipjack stock are now starting to appear as a result of massive fishing capacity and deadly efficiency. These declines are placing great threats on the region’s food security and economic prosperity, and the current mismanagement is undermining the marine ecosystem and the fishing industry itself.&lt;/p&gt;

	When whaling first boomed in the 17th century, it must have seemed as though whales would never disappear. Yet, by the mid 1940s their numbers had been drastically reduced.

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a moratorium on commercial whaling being declared in 1986, whale populations are still a long way from complete recovery. They now contend with additional threats such as pollution, climate change and collisions with ships.&lt;/p&gt;

	New Zealand seafood retailers have fallen well behind the world’s major markets when it comes to setting seafood sustainability standards, a Greenpeace report reveals.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Released today, the report, Oceans Advocates (1), reveals that internationally, consumer pressure is driving retailers to adopt responsible seafood sourcing practices. In recent years this has brought about encouraging changes in the seafood industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While many North American and European retailers have announced seafood policies, based on sustainability criteria, we’ve seen no such move from New Zealand supermarkets. Destruction is still on sale at your local seafood counter,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If New Zealand wants to maintain its clean, green reputation then our retailers and the seafood industry in general need to meet, or surpass, the standards set by our major export markets.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month the last of Canada’s eight major supermarket chains, Metro, confirmed it will stop selling orange roughy based on sustainability concerns. It is also removing New Zealand hoki. Both species are caught by destructive bottom trawling. The report details 16 other major retailers which have withdrawn orange roughy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also calls on policy makers to act to help the seafood industry to secure its own future while protecting the future of the world’s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sustainable seafood movement is not going away. Now it is crucial that political action is taken to ensure that those companies dragging their heels and continuing to trade in destructively caught fish are made to clean up their act before irreparable damage is done to our oceans and fisheries. It's time to establish a level playing field based on best practices for the entire industry,” says Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week at the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, Japan, the United Nations Environment Programme released a report (3) detailing how biodiversity, including ocean life contributes to global bottom lines and environmental protection is vital to economic prosperity. Greenpeace is demanding that the CBD produce a plan to save life on earth and delivered a concrete roadmap for governments to chart a course to oceans protection, the Oceans Emergency Rescue Plan (4), in advance of the summit in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Metro’s policy was announced on 23 September and will be fully implemented by June 2011. The company will remove seven species from sale across its 600 stores, as well as improving seafood labeling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Global fish stocks are plummeting. Industrial fishers are using increasingly sophisticated technology to locate and catch more and more fish. They’re outstripping nature’s ability to replenish the seas.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; border: 0; margin: 3px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/oceans/2010/oceans-fact-sheet-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="282"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s fleets can take massive quantities of fish from areas of ocean that used to be inaccessible. They can even trawl the surface of undersea mountains down to two kilometres beneath the waves. With nowhere to hide or recover, three quarters of the world’s fish species are being hunted faster than they can breed. Populations of the most popular fish like tuna, salmon, shark and swordfish have been devastated. They’ve plummeted 90 per cent since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is urging the US and fishing nations to agree to bold measures to protect Pacific tuna, at a vital meeting in Honolulu this week.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/photos/oceans/2010/GP0299U.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) meeting starts tomorrow, just as science shows the Pacific region’s tuna stocks are threatened by massive overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time and tuna are running out in the Pacific. This Honolulu meeting provides a chance for nations that fish in the Pacific to avoid repeating the failures of other tuna management meetings this year to create sustainable fisheries and healthy oceans,” said Phil Kline, Greenpeace USA oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is demanding that the US and other fishing nations back a proposal by Pacific Island Countries to close large areas of international waters in the Pacific to purse seine fishing to reverse the disastrous impacts of overfishing and illegal pirate fishing on the region’s troubled bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks and the people dependent on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace today (Monday, NZ time) hung a banner at Honolulu’s Aloha tower reading “WCPFC: Don’t Let Time Run Out on Tuna.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite calls from scientists to reduce catches since 2001, record catches have been consecutively hauled out of the Pacific in the last three years. Fleet capacity is growing and fishing methods are more efficient than ever in finding and capturing tuna. Wasteful fishing methods such as the use of fish aggregation devices (FADs; man-made objects used to attract tuna to purse seine fishing nets) are largely to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The out-of-control use of FADs is resulting in the needless wasting of sharks, turtles and juvenile tuna and rendering the once plentiful skipjack fisheries unsustainable. This fishing method must be banned if there is to be a tuna industry able to provide the Pacific region with jobs in the years to come,” said Lagi Toribau of Greenpeace Australia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since industrial fishing began nearly sixty years ago, nearly 90 per cent of the world’s large fish – such as tuna and swordfish – have been taken from the world’s oceans. If current practices continue unchecked, the fishing industry will literally fish itself out of existence. The recent failing of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to prevent the near-certain collapse of the Atlantic bluefin tuna proves that the undue influence of the fishing lobby on oceans management is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More than half of the world’s tuna is fished from the Pacific, and negotiators here in Honolulu have one of the last chances to get so-called oceans management right,” said Sari Tolvanen, Greenpeace International oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world, including the Pacific region, needs living oceans to survive and the best way to restore our oceans to health is by creating more marine reserves – wildlife parks at sea. If this meeting fails to reduce fishing and create more marine reserves, it’s aloha for the Pacific tuna and the millions of people it supports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a sustainable fishing industry and a global network of marine reserves covering 40 per cent of the world’s oceans as the necessary steps to leaving future generations with oceans able to sustain life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

	By Carmen Gravatt 

On Behalf of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is witnessing a historic, global shift in the way we power our economies, our businesses and our homes. As the sun sets on the era of fossil fuels, major, global economies are racing towards a new era of clean and renewable energy. And New Zealand is well equipped to capitalise on this shift. We are endowed with a high level of renewable electricity infrastructure and expertise; a wealth of talent for innovation and a can do attitude and a reputation as a clean, green place to do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is within this context that the Draft New Zealand Energy Strategy is being consulted on. However, the Government’s Strategy fails to recognise and provide the necessary support needed to fulfil New Zealand’s potential and in doing so fails to step-up to the challenge of climate change or understand the powerful influence climate change is already having on shaping our global energy future. By placing a heavy emphasis on boosting the exploitation of fossil fuels, the Draft Energy Strategy shows a particular lack of strategic vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world of depleting fossil fuel reserves and climate change there is no such thing as a low cost, high carbon economy. At this crucial time in New Zealand’s energy history we need a road map towards sustainable, clean, economy and strategies to capitalise on our clean green reputation, rather than a new fossil fuel rush which threatens to erode it. A range of major infrastructure and technological investments will be needed in the coming decades. The transition will involve hard choices between a number of technology pathways and policy options. This needs to be actively managed and will require strong regulation and coordination with public policy. We set out this challenge in the submission that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government seize upon the opportunity presented by climate change, and  global recession to move to a low carbon economy and ensure, long term sustainable prosperity and energy security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government adopt a target of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government adopt and communicate a target of 100% renewable electricity by 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government provide clear guidance and regulation to create a level playing field and enable businesses to invest with confidence, in a low carbon economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government initiate and expand existing support for research and development in clean-tech and sustainability sciences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Government underpin the investment needed to grow a clean economy, the Government should set up a Green Investment Bank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government safeguard and ensure the integrity of our clean green reputation.&lt;/li&gt;

	Wharekahika, Friday 15 April 2011: The flotilla opposing deep sea oil drilling were welcomed by Ngāti Porou today at Wharekahika/Hicks Bay, where the flotilla will be at anchor to avoid bad weather, facilitate crew changes and reprovision, before the boats return to the Raukūmara Basin to oppose deep sea oil exploration and drilling. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Te Whānau ā Apanui kaumātua Rikirangi Gage is expected to join the flotilla crew when it next heads out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will not tolerate control of our ancestral sea areas being determined by overseas oil interests and Government forces at sea,” says Rikirangi Gage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ocean has sustained our people for generations, we have looked after the sea and the sea has looked after us. But we are already seeing changes in arrival and breeding times of moki – a fish of prime importance to our tribe - due to climate and therefore sea temperature change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military presence of the &lt;em&gt;HMNZS Pūkakī&lt;/em&gt;, air force Orion flyovers and threats of arrest have not phased the flotilla members, who will continue to protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not intimidated by the Navy ship and remain resolute in our commitment to protest and ensure that deep sea oil exploration and drilling does not happen in New   Zealand waters,” says Greenpeace New Zealand Climate Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first round of protests at sea this week saw swimmers stop the seismic survey vessel &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; for nearly three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Far North tribe Te Rarawa have publicly announced support for te Whānau ā Apanui. “We absolutely support the role of te Whānau ā Apanui to impose their presence as the bona fide custodians of the area,” says Te Rūnanga o Te Rarawa spokesperson Hāmi Piripi. He says Government actions of using the military services to threaten the protest is a “forced entry mentality, which in most other domains is illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flotilla is made up of, and supported by, a coalition of individual skippers, peoples and groups including te Whānau ā Apanui, the Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla and Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

	This is the story of how our fishermen, having taken so many fish from the seas closer to home, are now venturing to the ends of the Earth in order to maintain our insatiable appetite for seafood. This is also the story of how a group of Antarctic scientists, environmentalists, retailers, and chefs are working together to support the protection of the Antarctic’s unique and beautiful Ross Sea – the healthiest
marine ecosystem remaining on Earth.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key opposition to the protection of the Ross Sea is likely to come from those countries who fish for and trade in Antarctic toothfish. If we want to ensure that the Ross Sea is protected, the demand for Antarctic toothfish must be reduced. So who is trading in Antarctic toothfish? Where does it get sold?

	Tokyo, Japan, January 28, 2011 – Greenpeace is calling for the official investigation into systematic embezzlement(1) within Japan’s whaling programme to be re-opened following disciplinary action against whaling officials for accepting whale meat ‘gifts’ from Kyodo Senpaku, the company that conducts the hunt.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As the ailing and fraudulent ‘scientific’ Japanese whaling fleet conducts a greatly reduced hunt in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, the Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) has been forced to apologise for the misconduct of five officials who accepted gifts of whale meat totalling approximately US$3,000. Two other key officials - including the FAJ’s second in command and prominent IWC negotiator, Jun Yamashita – were handed warnings, as they were ultimately responsible for the actions of their staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAJ’s apology and subsequent quiet admission(2) of official impropriety is the first time the Japanese authorities have acknowledged the corruption exposed in 2008 by Greenpeace’s Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, also known as the Tokyo Two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Toru Suzuki and I exposed a broad-scale whale meat embezzlement scandal inside Japan’s whaling industry in 2008, and we spent over two years in court defending ourselves for speaking out,” said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan Executive Director. “The FAJ’s admission that high-level officials such as Yamashita were responsible for its officers accepting expensive whale meat gifts is yet more proof of this systemic and deep-rooted corruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato and Suzuki are currently appealing a one year suspended sentence, which was handed to them in September 2010 after they were found guilty of ‘theft’ and ‘trespass’ for intercepting a box of embezzled whale meat and using it to expose corruption in the whaling industry.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box of embezzled meat Sato and Suzuki intercepted was worth $550 according to prosecutors – far less than what industry officials have now admitted to taking, and according to evidence and witness testimony from the Tokyo Two trial, what has been admitted is merely the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the FAJ apology, Kazuo Yamamura, head of the Japan Whaling Association (JWA) and CEO of Kyodo Senpaku, admitted during another press conference that whale meat sales dropped 30 per cent in the first half of 2010, forcing the JWA - the largest promoter of whale meat in Japan - to downscale its activities.(4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With a smaller fleet(5) in the Southern Ocean hunting a reduced target of whales, a growing 5,300 tonne stockpile of meat in frozen storage,(6) and now an official admission that the corruption we exposed exists, it is clear that the whaling industry’s days are numbered,” said Sato. “As the embezzlement of public money is now undeniable, the official investigation into the scandal we exposed must be reopened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace is an independent, global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment, and to promote peace. Greenpeace is opposed to commercial whaling in all of the world’s oceans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The Tokyo Prosecutors' Office opened an investigation into embezzlement based on evidence presented by Greenpeace Japan in May 2008; the investigation was dropped on 20 June 2008, and two Greenpeace activists arrested. For more information, see (3) below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) A press release was sent to select Tokyo journalists, but not otherwise published or uploaded to its website. A copy is available from Greenpeace Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) In January 2008, Greenpeace began an investigation into insider allegations that organised whale meat embezzlement was being conducted by crew inside Japan's so-called ’scientific‘ whaling programme, which is funded by Japanese taxpayers. The informer was previously involved in the whaling programme, and as a result of his information, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki began an investigation, eventually discovering firm proof that cardboard boxes containing whale meat were being secretly shipped to the homes of whaling fleet crew - and then sold for personal profit. Junichi delivered a box of this whale meat to the Tokyo Prosecutors' Office in May 2008, and filed a report of embezzlement. However, the embezzlement investigation was dropped on 20 June - the same day that both men were arrested and then held for 26 days, 23 of which were without charge. They were convicted of theft and trespass on September 6, 2010, and sentenced to one year in prison, suspended for three years. Unexpectedly, on December 22, 2010, the Fisheries Agency of Japan announced that it was reprimanding five of its officials, and giving formal warnings to two senior officials, for accepting whale meat gifts from the industry – further confirming Sato and Suzuki’s accusations of broad-scale corruption. The Tokyo Two, as Sato and Suzuki are known, are currently appealing their conviction, which is due to be heard in the Sendai High Court on May 24, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/tokyo-two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) A report from fisheries newspaper Minato Shinbun on Monday, January 24, 2011 discussed a press conference held on January 20 by Kyodo Senpaku, the Japan Whaling Association, and the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), where the three bodies outlined the many serious problems facing the whaling industry. Kazuo Murayama, the CEO of Kyodo Senpaku and the head of the Japan Whaling Association said "annual sales have decreased 30% during the first half of [2010] (fiscal year)" and mentioned that the JWA’s activities may be decreased as a result. The ICR announced that it has reduced the number of its executive directors to one. Yoshihiro Fujise, who was appointed as the first "proper" (he is a scientist promoted from within the ICR, not a retired FAJ executive) Executive Director of ICR since Nov 30 2010, also explained that the financial model of covering the research costs by selling whale meat as a “byproduct” of the research no longer worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Lloyd’s Seaweb lists the status of the Hiyo Maru, the ship used to refuel the fleet and offload whale meat at sea, as “broken up” as of 2 September 2010. A document given to the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (SC/62/O17) lists the Yushin-Maru 3 as being dedicated to the sightings survey. Another document (SC/62/O3) reported that in the 2009-10 season, the Yushin-Maru 3 was used only for sightings and did not hunt. The 2009-10 season was the first in which only two catchers were used since the programme began in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

	The government has once more demonstrated that its commitment to addressing climate change is no more than window dressing, says Greenpeace New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The government has just announced it's awarded oil and gas
exploration permits for four areas of the Great South Basin (in the
southern oceans off Southland) to major international investors.
The investors (1) will spend more than a billion dollars exploring
the Basin over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oil and gas are fossil fuels, the burning of which causes
climate change," said Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiamid.
"It's well known that if we want to avoid the most catastrophic
impacts of climate change, the use of these sorts of fuels must be
phased out and replaced by renewable sources of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yet the government is ramping up investment in these climate
polluting fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It proudly proclaims that the level and intensity of the work
proposed for the Great South Basin is unprecedented in New
Zealand's history - there couldn't be a worse time to be
encouraging this sort of activity, let alone unprecedented levels
of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And this from a Government that prides itself on being a
champion for sustainability and wants to lead the world by becoming
carbon neutral. If that's really its goal, it's heading in
completely the wrong direction. Encouraging the use of oil and gas
is completely incompatible with the goal of carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Associate Energy Minister makes much of the economic
benefits of oil and gas exploration, but seems to forget the
massive economic costs of failing to act on climate change. Just
last year, former World Bank economist Sir Nicholas Stern warned
that doing nothing on climate change would cost the global economy
up to 20 times more than taking steps to reduce our emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In its press release, the government says New Zealand "will be
dependent on oil and gas for some time to come", but we don't have
to be," says Ms McDiarmid. "New Zealand is in a perfect position to

	The legacy of the Rainbow Warrior is important to New Zealanders. When the original Warrior was bombed 25 years ago, in Auckland’s harbour, Kiwis rallied to support Greenpeace. In 1989 we launched the Rainbow Warrior II, and now we urgently need to replace her.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As you’re probably aware, the New Zealand office hopes to raise $400,000 to fund the new Warrior’s “Rapid Response Centre”. We’ve made some great progress towards that goal, raising approximately $150,000 so far. Hundreds of supporters have donated online at &lt;a href="http://www.rainbow-warrior.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;www.rainbow-warrior.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; and many more have sent donations in through the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fundraising auction in Auckland on October 20 was also a great success. Greenpeace supporters, spanning several generations, gathered at Webb’s auction house in Newmarket to celebrate the achievements of the Rainbow Warrior and to help write the next chapter in her extraordinary story. There is not space to thank everyone individually, but we’d like to acknowledge the generous Kiwi artists, businesses and supporters who &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/about/ships/the-rainbow-warrior/Fundraising-Auction/#auction-items"&gt;donated items&lt;/a&gt;, time and effort to help make this event the success it was.&lt;/p&gt;

	The directors of 20 major greenhouse-polluting New Zealand companies have been warned of possible litigation if they don't take action on climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Australian law firm Maurice Blackburn Cashman, acting on behalf
of Greenpeace, "served notice" &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; on the companies that
they could be held liable for their contribution to the damage and
costs of climate change, especially if they refuse to change
current practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving notice means the companies and their directors won't be
able to "plead ignorance" in any future climate-related
litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson said all 20
companies targeted today were major polluters, and it was time they
took action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We're trying to open doors for these companies, by saying
positive action on climate change is the best way forward, but,
we're also firmly "closing the back door" so they can't evade
prosecution in the future," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases around the world show climate change litigation is being
increasingly used to deal with major greenhouse offenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent landmark cases won by plaintiffs against government
agencies include the Anvill Hill decision in Australia, and
Massachusetts v EPA in the USA &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;. In California, six
major car companies are being sued for damages resulting from their
past and ongoing contributions to global warming
&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Atkinson likened climate change to tobacco and asbestos cases
in terms of potential company liability. Companies in both these
industries have had to pay out huge sums of money in
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Gilsenan, Principal, Maurice Blackburn Cashman
&lt;sup&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt; said companies engaging in activities that result in
greenhouse gas emissions need to consider whether they're risking
litigation, including damages claims or regulatory prosecution.
"Once the directors are aware of climate change related risk,
failure to address that risk may amount to a breach of directors'
duties."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20 companies include key players in all the major greenhouse
polluting sectors - electricity generation, transport, industrial
processes and agriculture. Many of the companies are considering
new projects that would increase their pollution levels. In
addition, some have been reluctant to fully disclose their
potential climate-related liabilities to shareholders, investors
and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies include: Genesis Energy (the electricity generator),
Solid Energy (coal miner), New Zealand Refining Company (oil
refiner), Fulton Hogan (roading), Fonterra (dairy) and Landcorp
(the country's biggest farming company).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's Vanessa Atkinson said responsibility for addressing
climate risk did not lie just with business. "The New Zealand
government should be setting targets to cut emissions, putting a
price on greenhouse pollution, kick-starting a switch to clean,
renewable energy sources and boosting energy efficiency and
conservation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Questions &amp;amp; Answers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1) What is "Serving Notice"?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Serving Notice" is a mechanism by which companies and their
directors are informed of their exposure to Climate Risk and their
responsibility to address it.  It makes it difficult for companies
to assert, in any future climate-change-related litigation or
prosecution that they were ignorant as to risks presented by their
activities. In other words, they won't be able to argue that they
did not know about risks presented by climate change, or the damage
they were causing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2) What is "Climate Risk"?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate Risk describes the range of financial risks that climate
change presents to a company. Examples include: disruption to
operations; the introduction of a "cost on carbon"; damage to
reputation, or climate litigation (where legal action is taken
against a company on the basis of its contribution to climate
change). The extent to which a company is exposed to Climate Risk
will depend on that company's operations and future plans. &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/reports/financial-risk-of-climate-change/"&gt;
A briefing paper on the finnancial risk of climate change is
available for download here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3) Who's involved in this action?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Greenpeace New Zealand,
Australia's Maurice Blackburn Cashman Lawyers and New Zealand's
worst greenhouse gas emitters from all the major greenhouse gas
polluting sectors - electricity, transport, industrial processing
and agriculture. (Maurice Blackburn Cashman has been Australia's
leading law firm in bringing successful "class actions" on behalf
of victims of corporate malpractice. In 2003, they "served notice"
on 146 Australian companies. Because we're using an Australian law
firm, Greenpeace's Australia-Pacific office is also involved in
this process.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4) What is the legal basis for possible climate litigation? Who
could be liable and who could claim?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least three ways a company and/or its directors
could be liable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) It is a basic principle of law that if a person suffers harm
- for example, as a consequence of the greenhouse pollution caused
by a company - then the person may be entitled to compensation from
the company who harmed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies who have received the notices are major polluters.
Pollution causes damage and those who suffer damage may be entitled
to compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage could be anything from floods, to sea-level rise, to
hurricanes and crop failures, so there is a wide range of potential
plaintiffs - from individual home owners whose homes are flooded,
to industries like wine-makers and ski resorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii) Company directors could also be sued by shareholders and
other affected persons under the NZ Companies Act 1993, which
requires them to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;act in good faith and in the best interests of the company
(s131);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;not agree to, or cause or allow reckless trading that involves
the business of the company being carried out in a manner likely to
create a substantial risk of serious loss to creditors (s135);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;not agree to the company incurring obligations unless there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the company will be able to
perform them (s136);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;exercise reasonable care, diligence and skill (s137); and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;disclose relevant interests to the board (s140).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In other words, directors have a legal obligation to reasonably
assess business risks and then minimize them. If climate change
presents a high level of risk to a company - and the directors fail
to fulfill their duties and take action to reduce that risk, the
directors could be liable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iii) In addition, under the Markets Securities Act 1988 and the
NZX Listing Rules, publicly listed companies are required to
disclose material information to the share market, to ensure a
transparent and fair share trading environment.  "Material
information" includes a change in a company's financial forecast or
expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment of increased attention on dangerous climate
change, regulatory changes, such as carbon taxes or the closure of
climate-damaging industries may have a serious impact on companies'
bottom lines.  Directors who do not consider and disclose such
effects where they in fact diminish financial forecasts may be
prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5) Why is Greenpeace doing this?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate Change is real and happening. These companies are major
contributors to the problem. Climate change won't just affect the
environment; it will also have a major impact on the economy.
Business must take some responsibility and act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are giving these companies a clear message that a "wait and
see" approach to climate change just doesn't cut it any more. We're
opening the door for them to do the right thing and get on with the
job of addressing climate change, but we're also "closing the back
door" so they can't in the future try to evade prosecution by
pleading ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6) Which companies have been targeted?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(in alphabetical order):&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air New Zealand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter Holt Harvey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fonterra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fulton Hogan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greymouth Petroleum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holcim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landcorp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil and Gas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Refining Company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Steel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norske Skog Tasman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pan Pacific Forest Products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shell New Zealand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solid Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;7) Why THESE companies?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are companies that are engaged in activities which emit
significant amounts of greenhouse gases and/ or have a significant
proportion of their capital tied up in greenhouse gas emitting
activities. They may even be increasing their greenhouse pollution,
when they should be reducing it. They may also have obstructed, or
be obstructing, efforts to reduce measures which would require them
to reduce their pollution (eg they may plan to build more roads, or
they may actively oppose Government regulation/ carbon
charges). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include companies which are involved in fossil fuel
industries (coal, oil, natural gas) or road transport, which
consume large amounts of energy or which emit greenhouse pollution
through manufacturing or through agricultural practices. It will be
these sorts of companies that will be most vulnerable to regulatory
or litigation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that take a particularly obstructive role - for
example lobbying against regulatory action on climate change -
could end up facing an increased risk of litigation. It's well
known that one of the main reasons tobacco companies have been
liable for health damage in the US and Australia, is that they
actively covered up scientific studies and lobbied against controls
on smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;8) Have there been any climate change cases fought and won
overseas?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change litigation (ie- where legal action by citizens or
governments is taken on the basis of climate change and its
impacts) is becoming increasingly common around the world and there
are positive indications that courts are prepared to embrace legal
arguments around climate. It is entirely possible that climate
change will become the next asbestos or tobacco in the eyes of the
law. &lt;a href="/new-zealand/PageFiles/113249/history-climate-change-litigation.pdf"&gt;
Download a briefing on the history of similar climate change
litigation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10) Is this for real?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. First, Greenpeace is not afraid to go to court to protect
the public and the planet. In New Zealand, we've already been to
court to fight Marsden B, and to support renewable energy projects
such as West Wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we see this as a serious and constructive initiative.
We've put a lot of time and effort into putting together a
discussion paper, which accompanies the serve notice letter, and
which gives companies a complete overview of the problem, and what
they need to do - for the benefit of both their company, and the
planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of climate change is extremely serious and all parts
of our society need to take responsibility. Our business and
industrial sectors have particular responsibility due to the type
of activities they engage in and their power to influence
government policy. They need to be aware of their responsibilities,
and made accountable. Serving notice on these companies is the
first step in achieving more accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;11) What did the Australian Serve Notice action achieve?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Serve Notice drew a line in the sand and helped
sort out the wheat from the chaff. Some companies responded
positively, with new initiatives that helped reduce their exposure
to climate risk. Others responded negatively or not at all - which
only exposed them to further scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's now 4 years down the track, and expectations on our
business leaders are much higher in relation to climate change. So
we're hoping that all the New Zealand companies we've written to
will respond positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;12) What do you want these New Zealand companies to do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't want to tell each company exactly what they have to do
- directors are paid big money to do that. But obviously, the best
way to reduce potential and future liability is to reduce the
amount of damage you're doing - and that means reducing the amount
of pollution you're pumping out. Companies will also have to be
much more careful about new developments - to make sure they're not
investing in something that might make a quick buck, but end up
being a liability a few years down the track. And last of all,
there's no longer any justification for companies trying to block
government programs that reduce pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's got to be more than window-dressing - i.e. it's not good
enough to simply say "we agree climate change is a problem and will
do our best" but then go on with business-as-usual.&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Australia: Rebecca Gilsenan, Principal, Maurice Blackburn Cashman, +61 2 82670959

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) "Serving notice" is a mechanism by which companies and their directors are informed of their exposure to Climate Risk and their responsibility to address it.  The notification makes it more difficult for companies to assert, in any future climate change-related litigation that they were ignorant of the risks associated with their activities.

(2) Anvil Hill coal mine:  (Gray v The Minister for Planning [2006] NSWLEC 720:
The judge in this case ruled that the impacts of climate change had to be taken into account in relation to a major development. (This time a large new open-cut coal mine at Anvil Hill, near Newcastle, capable of producing up to 10.5 million tones of coal a year over 21 years.)

State, local and administrative authorities could now face similar proceedings if they "unreasonably fail" to take account of the effects of global warming when making decisions.

Mass.v.EPA.USSC (Massachusetts, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al)
In the most significant court decision on climate change so far, the US Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. The Court held in favour of a coalition including 12 US States, 4 local authorities and 13 non-government organizations against the Environmental Protection Agency.

(3) The lawsuit is the first of its kind to seek to hold manufacturers liable for the damages caused by greenhouse gases that their products emit. The case has been brought by California's Attorney General against leading U.S. and Japanese auto manufacturers: Chrysler Motors Corporation, General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Toyota Motor North America, Inc., Honda North America, and Nissan North America.

(4) Maurice Blackburn Cashman is Australia's leading class actions law firm. It has successfully brought cases for tens of thousands of victims of corporate malpractice.  In 2003, Maurice Blackburn Cashman "served notice" on 146 Australian companies regarding their climate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

	As governments begin another round of international climate change negotiations today, this time in Cancun, Mexico, we could all do with a lesson from the history of the indigenous Mayan people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At its peak, Mayan society was one of the most densely populated and culturally dynamic societies in the world. It was noted for the only known fully developed &lt;a title="Maya script" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script"&gt;written language&lt;/a&gt; of its time, as well as its &lt;a title="Maya art" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_art"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Maya architecture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_architecture"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and mathematical and astronomical systems. The Mayans were also accomplished scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of this once great civilization has been the subject of continued debate but increasingly accurate records from ice cores, tree rings and some deep sea sediments provide evidence of multi-year droughts in the region, each event leading to a collapse of a portion of the population, until those remaining could not survive the last severe drought. For all their sophistication, the Mayans did not see their destruction coming. But we can see ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, a clean energy future is a choice we can still make. An international climate change agreement could catalyse and help pay for a world with clean, secure and independent means of energy guaranteed for generations to come. It could keep natural and ancient forests standing and forest peoples thriving, as well as protecting many forest species and helping to stop catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business as usual will mean more temperature increases, threatening many aspects of our society, including coastal cities and infrastructure, water supply and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments at the Cancun Climate Conference have to weigh their options carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must acknowledge the cuts they have already promised are not enough, make the right decisions on the structure of an agreement and decide how they provide new money for developing country action and adaptation.  They must agree how to open the coffers to provide money to stop deforestation in developing countries. They must close loopholes around rules for forests and land use that could increase emissions from industrialized countries.&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they can do these things in Cancun, we can start to believe that governments have woken up to the stark reality facing the planet.The Mayans may not have had the information or the tools to prevent the collapse of their civilization but from our vantage point in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century we truly can see into the future and we can choose a different path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take action: spread the word and tell everyone you know that a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/er-ship/Galley/tweet-er/" target="_blank"&gt;fossil-fuel free future is necessary - and possible. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the New Zealand Government to support a plan to make the Pacific's tuna fisheries sustainable following further reports of declining stocks.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Global tuna stocks have plummeted due to overfishing. The Pacific is now the world’s last relatively healthy fishery and must be protected if we are to avoid the same thing happening here”, said Lagi Toribau Greenpeace Australia Pacific Ocean Campaigner who was in New Zealand this week to highlight the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks of Pacific skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna are in decline according to reports (1) presented at a meeting of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in Tonga this week. Pacific skipjack supplies 55 per cent of the world’s tinned tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this year the WCPFC will discuss a plan to close four areas of international waters in the Pacific region to all fishing (2). The plan already has the support of Pacific island nations and Australia. The New Zealand Government has not confirmed its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand must support its neighbours to make the Pacific’s tuna fisheries sustainable. Doing so is vital for the well-being of Pacific Island nations, both as a crucial economic resource and as a primary source of food, and the health of the ocean,” said Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also calling on countries to reduce regional tuna catches by 50 per cent and ban purse-seine fishing using fish aggregation devices (FADs). This method is meant to increases catch levels and efficiency - however it results in large numbers of turtles and sharks being caught together with juvenile tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record 2,467,903 million metric tonnes of tuna were caught in the Pacific last year. Figures show that 73 per cent was skipjack tuna caught mainly by large purse-seine fleets using FADs to attract fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigeye and yellowfin tuna continue to decline as conservation efforts to date have proved to be too little too late. The breeding population of Pacific bigeye tuna is now estimated to be down to 17 per cent, close to the levels of the Atlantic bluefin tuna which is below 15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An enormous ecological, social and economic disaster is looming and the Pacific Island countries must ban purse-seine fishing using FADs and cut the number of fishing vessels licensed in their waters before it is too late” said Toribau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a two-month ban on FADs in the Pacific proved effective in reducing the bycatch of vulnerable bigeye and yellowfin tuna, but subsequent resumption of FAD fishing for the remainder of the year resulted in large catches of juvenile tuna (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for sustainable and equitable fisheries and a global network of marine reserves to cover 40 per cent of our oceans – area off limits to harmful fishing, and mining, drilling and other extractive activities. With marine reserves, our oceans and fish stocks can begin to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

	Prime Minister Helen Clark has lost her way in the climate debate and is making bizarrely incorrect and misguided statements on the subject, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I am shell-shocked that the leader of New Zealand is so
confused over the biggest threat that this country faces," said
Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And this is the very woman who's issued a vision of a carbon
-neutral, sustainable New Zealand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister, in Sydney on a week-long tour of Australia,
told the Seven Network that arguments against traveling overseas or
buying foreign food because of the carbon footprint were "idiotic"
and not the way to tackle climate change.    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also said arguments about the amount of carbon dioxide
emitted through the use of fossil fuels were "false science".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is of real concern," said Ms Atkinson. "Helen Clark is
either playing dumb in order to downplay a very serious situation
or she's got completely the wrong end of the stick. Either way,
it's dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"She's effectively rubbishing the proven science of climate
change, which is that fossil fuels lead to carbon emissions which
lead to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And to top it off, she's labeling the world's leading
scientists idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Of course traveling overseas in a plane contributes to climate
change. A return flight to Australia alone causes the release of
greenhouse gases equivalent to 1.3 tons of CO2 for every passenger
on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And it's not just CO2; the full climate change impacts of air
travel are much worse when you factor in nitrous and water vapour
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People should be considering climate change when choosing
whether to travel, and they should also have it in mind when
sourcing their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It just beggars belief that the New Zealand Prime Minister
could make such rash and wrong statements about such a crucial
issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand needs to be taking positive action to tackle
climate change, not burying its head in the sand."&lt;/p&gt;

            Wind can provide New Zealand with clean, renewable energy.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace supported this project and joined the appeal in the
Environment court on the basis of its significance in helping New
Zealand reduce greenhouse pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six wind turbines will be built at Makara as part of
Meridian Energy's West Wind project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site will generate enough electricity to supply most
households in the Greater Wellington region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson said the decision
brought New Zealand one step closer to a clean energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This was just the kind of project New Zealand needs to reduce
its skyrocketing emissions and eventually achieve a 100 per cent
switch to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Zealand has an abundant wind resource and utilising it together
with other renewable energy sources and with increasing energy
efficiency means we can stop depending on dwindling and dirty
supplies of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable energy is a safe, simple and obvious key part of the
solution to climate change"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Project West Wind effectively avoids pumping out a half
million  tonnes of CO2 annually, and emissions reductions from the
project will save New Zealand up to $26 million in avoiding the
purchase of emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a great example of the Resource Management Act doing
its job in assessing the local impacts and the contribution that
renewable energy projects can make to tackling climate change - the
greatest challenge facing the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Atkinson said renewable energy sources such as wind were a
key plank in Greenpeace's New Zealand Energy Revolution: How to
prevent climate chaos report, which was developed last year by
local and international experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report sets out a pathway for a secure and environmentally
sustainable New Zealand energy system, and concludes we can achieve
a 100% renewable electricity supply by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Vanessa Atkinson, Climate Campaigner     021 565 165

	Genesis Energy has filed new legal proceedings against Greenpeace in an extraordinary attempt to have a High Court ruling protecting the climate reversed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We are dumbfounded that Genesis is doing this, and even more
astonished that the shareholding government ministers Michael
Cullen and Trevor Mallard are letting it," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time when the whole country is looking to tackle climate
change, an SOE is taking legal action to give polluting power a
free pass on climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The High Court ruling that Genesis wants reversed involved
fellow State Owned Enterprise (SOE) Mighty River Power's plans to
convert the Marsden B power station in Northland to run on
coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The High Court ruled in favour of Greenpeace and against Mighty
River Power by declaring that regional councils must take climate
change into account when granting resource consents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power had filed an appeal of that decision to the
Court of Appeal (which Genesis tried to join) but it was dropped
when Mighty River Power abandoned the Marsden B proposal earlier
this year, after a three year campaign against the project by
Greenpeace and community groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis has now started new legal proceedings for a declaration
to reverse the High Court decision, saying such a declaration would
help it gain resource consents for its Rodney power station.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If Genesis wins this case it could remove the only legal
control on polluters' greenhouse gas emissions. This means that any
climate polluting projects (such as Genesis' forthcoming Rodney gas
proposal) could go through the consent process without climate
change being considered at all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis also runs Huntly power station, which is New Zealand's
biggest single greenhouse gas emitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Helen Clark says she wants New Zealand to be carbon neutral and
the Energy Minister is constantly repeating his preference for "a
renewable energy future". Yet the government is letting one of its
own companies use the courts to undermine that future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It seems the Labour Government still doesn't accept the need
for climate change to be at the forefront of decision making, and
is prepared to let one of its SOEs try and get climate change off
the agenda altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government should be bringing greenhouse gas emitters to
account for their polluting activities, not allowing its SOEs to
take Greenpeace to court for trying to protect the climate. This is
blatant hypocrisy, and it's taking New Zealand in completely the
wrong direction in terms of the climate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Vanessa Atkinson (Climate Campaigner) 021565 165
Kathy Cumming (Communications Officer) 021 495 216&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; What exactly is Genesis seeking?

Genesis has asked the High Court to declare that, when a project for which consent is sought doesn’t involve renewable energy, 1) authorities do not have to consider the effects of greenhouse gases emissions on climate change 2) renewable energy and climate change are not relevant considerations, and 3) regional councils may not make rules that have regard to climate change.  

How do Genesis’ actions tie in with the RMA?

The Resource Management Act (RMA) was amended in 2004 to affect regional councils’ ability to directly manage and regulate greenhouse emissions.  But Greenpeace argued in the High Court that the RMA still provides for climate change to be considered through the benefits of renewable energy development in reducing climate change emissions. The High Court decision confirmed that it does.

Timeline:

October 2004 – Mighty River Power lodge application with Northland Regional Council for resource consent to refire Marsden B power station on coal.

October 2005 - Greenpeace and other community groups lodged an appeal to the Environment Court.

February 2006 - Mighty River Power submitted to the Environment Court that climate change could not be considered in the overall appeal.

July 2006 - The Environment Court made its decision regarding the relevance of climate change to the overall appeal, finding that climate change is not a relevant consideration that can and must be taken into account when approving Marsden B.

August 2006 - Greenpeace appealed the decision on climate change to the High Court.

October 2006 -The High Court overturned the Environment Court decision and said that climate change does need to be considered.

November 2006 - Mighty River Power challenged the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal. Genesis Energy indicated their interest in joining the appeal on Mighty River’s side, and after failing in an attempt to join in the High Court, applied in the Court of Appeal to join as a party to the proceedings, but their application was never heard.

March 2007 - Mighty River Power abandoned its coal plans at Marsden B and withdrew its resource consent application and its appeal to the Court of Appeal.

May 2007 – Genesis Energy filed new legal proceedings against Greenpeace in an attempt to have the effect of the High Court ruling protecting the climate reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exp. contact date:&lt;/b&gt; 2007-06-24 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;

	Renaca, Chile (Friday, 5 May, 2007)
– After years of difficult negotiations, Greenpeace is welcoming an agreement
which could put an end to New Zealand high seas bottom trawling in the South
Pacific.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The agreement was reached at a meeting of over 20 countries in
Chile to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;establish a fisheries management organisation for the South
Pacific (RFMO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It specifies that fishing vessels will not be allowed to bottom
trawl in areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that are already identified or likely to have vulnerable marine
ecosystems such&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as cold water corals and sponge fields, without prior assessment
and measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation and management measures must be put in place before
any fishing can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an extrememly important step in protecing the
irreplaceable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;biodiversity of deep sea ecosystems," said Mike Hagler,
Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It has been encouraging to see the New Zealand government
strongly supporting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;measures to prevent damage from bottom trawling in the region.
We'll be watching closely to ensure that the New Zealand government
now puts this agreement into action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other controls agreed to include vessel locator monitoring
systems and observers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on every bottom trawling vessel. The measures will come into
force on September 30th this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes are particularly relevant to New Zealand, whose
fleet is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;responsible for 90% of the bottom trawling in the South Pacific
region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand delegates told the meeting that the new measures
would severely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;constrain the ability of the New Zealand fishing industry to
continue bottom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;trawling on the high seas around New Zealand. It may even have
the effect of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;putting an end to bottom trawling on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand government should be congratulated for playing
such a key role in reaching this agreement. It really is a
significant achievment."&lt;/p&gt;

GM trial risky, costly and pointless</title><date>2007-05-29 00:00:00</date><text>
	Greenpeace has condemned the Environment Risk Management Authority’s (ERMA) decision to approve a field test of GM Brassica.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"ERMA's finding that risks to the environment are negligible
flies in the face of all the.scientific uncertainties," said
Greenpeace Campaign Manager Carmen Gravatt. "The trial is a
pointless waste of money and it poses a needless risk to the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The authority has failed to apply a precautionary approach and
in doing so, has put both our environment and agriculture industry
at stake. Its decision is completely out of step with international
best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"ERMA says it supports the trial because it might help us gain a
better understanding of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). But
given the huge risks involved in this sort of work, New Zealand
should never become an exporter of GMOs and therefore field tests
are actually a complete waste of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The money would be far better used on research on conventional
agriculture that people actually want and that can benefit New
Zealand domestically and internationally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ERMA is yet to decline a GM field trial application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Carmen Gravatt (Campaigns Manager)– 021302251
Kathy Cumming (Communications) 021 495 216 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; ERMA’s decision can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.ermanz.govt.nz/news-events/focus/brassicas06/index.html"&gt;http://www.ermanz.govt.nz/news-events/focus/brassicas06/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
The decision concluded that:

2.12.4	The following overall evaluation of risks and costs (incorporating adverse effects) and benefits (incorporating beneficial or positive effects) was carried out having regard to clauses 22 and 34 of the Methodology, and in accordance with the tests in clause 26 of the Methodology and section 45 of the Act.  Clause 26 of the Methodology is the appropriate reference for making the decision since all identified potentially significant risks have been assessed as being negligible. 
2.12.5	Risks and costs considered but found to be negligible were those associated with effects on the environment, effects on human health and safety, the relationships of Māori to the environment and Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi, society and community, and market economy.  In making these assessments the Committee considered both the impact of containment and other controls and the effects of the GM brassicas if they were to escape from containment.  In aggregate, all risks were considered to be negligible.
2.12.6 The Committee concluded that the primary benefits accruing from the field test are the enhancement of knowledge and understanding of agronomic practices associated with these brassicas genetically modified for /Bt/ expression, and upskilling of staff and increased experience in working with gene technology in the field. The Committee assessed these benefits as non-negligible. 

2.12.7 The Committee noted all external costs are negligible and that after considering the impact of the combined controls the organisms can be adequately contained. Consequently, the Committee determined that the benefits outweigh the costs of the application.

	Sunday February 6, 2011, New Plymouth: Greenpeace says that yesterday’s action on board the MV Great Motion leaves the Government with no option but to decide on what its policy is on palm kernel, and that the only option is to put a stop to its use.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The last of Greenpeace’s activists were removed from the cranes on board the ship at 1930 hours Saturday – 12 hours after the action began.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One activist spent five and a half hours on the ship’s anchor chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four of the activists have been charged with unlawfully being on a ship, while the activist who was on the anchor chain has been charged with committing a dangerous activity involving a ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Greenpeace has managed to successfully highlight the enormous quantities of palm kernel that are being imported for Fonterra’s farms, and to show that the Government is being dangerously short-sighted on a vital issue that presents a real economic risk to New Zealand, through  potential damage to our clean green brand,” says Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner Nathan Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Thirty thousand tonnes of palm kernel have passed through Port Taranaki just this week. Ten thousand tonnes were on board this ship alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Last year 1.4 million tonnes of palm kernel were imported into New Zealand. That’s a quarter of a billion dollar's worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government has to get its facts straight on palm kernel, and respond to the threat it poses to our economy and to the climate, and put a stop to its use,” Argent says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says it's concerned Solid Energy isn't the only State Owned Enterprise spying on community groups.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It has been revealed that Solid Energy indirectly hired spies to
infiltrate a community group campaigning against it. The company
employed private investigators Thompson and Clark, who in turn paid
students to spy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says a news report last year showed the same private
investigators were employed by Mighty River Power, another State
Owned Enterprise, which at the time was seeking consent to re-fire
the Marsden B coal-fired power station in Northland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace actively opposed the consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the news report last year, Greenpeace and several of
its individual campaigners formally requested that Mighty River
Power release all information it had on them, including any
gathered by a private investigator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power has refused to do so and complaints on this
refusal are currently being considered by the Privacy Commissioner
and the Ombudsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Thompson and Clark have infiltrated other
community groups is concerning, and raises the question of whether
spying is becoming a regular way of doing business for publicly
owned companies," said Greenpeace Executive Director, Bunny
McDiarmid. "Mighty River Power are refusing to tell us what
information they have on us or how it was gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a very serious attack on democracy for the Government
through its State Owned Enterprises to sanction the infiltration of
a community group. Not only is it a shocking waste of taxpayers
money, but it is also unethical and we would be surprised if the
public would think it acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government should be taking this matter extremely seriously
and we urge the Minister for State Owned Enterprises to launch an
investigation into the full extent of spying by publicly owned
companies on community groups and stomp out the practice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980's Greenpeace was infiltrated by a French
Government spy, Christine Cabon, which culminated in the bombing of
the Rainbow Warrior in 1985 killing one Greenpeace crew member.&lt;/p&gt;

	The increased quota for southern bluefin tuna puts the species on the fast track to extinction, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Fisheries announced this afternoon that the quota for southern bluefin tuna will be increased for the second year in a row.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas says it is obscene to raise the quota for a species already listed as critically endangered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We simply should not be fishing for a species that is this close to extinction” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Southern bluefin stocks are down to 4.6 per cent and New Zealand has more than doubled the quota in the last five years (1). We are talking about a species that’s in as much strife as Maui’s dolphins and the kakapo.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worldwide, bluefin catches have been reduced in response to declining numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to editor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Total Allowable Catch by fishing year:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2005-2006    237 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2006-2007    379 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2007-2008    318 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2008-2009    420 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2009-2010    532 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2010-2011    539 Tonnes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace submission on the Ministry of Fisheries quota proposals (Dec 2010):&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/oceans/2010/Greenpeace%20submission%20SBT%20Dec%202010(2).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/P3/publications/oceans/2010/Greenpeace%20submission%20SBT%20Dec%202010%282%29.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After years of difficult negotiations, Greenpeace is welcoming an agreement which could put an end to New Zealand high seas bottom trawling in the South Pacific.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The agreement was reached at a meeting of over 20 countries in
Chile to establish a fisheries management organisation for the
South Pacific (RFMO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It specifies that fishing vessels will not be allowed to bottom
trawl in areas that are already identified or likely to have
vulnerable marine ecosystems such as cold water corals and sponge
fields, without prior assessment and measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation and management measures must be put in place before
any fishing can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an extremely important step in protecting the
irreplaceable biodiversity of deep sea ecosystems," said Mike
Hagler of Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It has been encouraging to see the New Zealand government
strongly supporting measures to prevent damage from bottom trawling
in the region. We'll be watching closely to ensure that the New
Zealand government now puts this agreement into action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other controls agreed to include vessel locator monitoring
systems and observers on every bottom trawling vessel. The measures
will come into force on September 30th this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes are particularly relevant to New Zealand, whose
fleet is responsible for 90% of the bottom trawling in the South
Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand delegates told the meeting that the new measures
would severely constrain the ability of the New Zealand fishing
industry to continue bottom trawling on the high seas around New
Zealand.  It may even have the effect of putting an end to bottom
trawling on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand government should be congratulated for playing
such a key role in reaching this agreement. It really is a
significant achievement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Duncan Currie, Greenpeace International +64 21 632 335

	Greenpeace is demanding that Japan’s Government finally end its commercial whaling programme and re-open an investigation into corruption scandals inside the industry, following today’s announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries that it has recalled its Antarctic whaling fleet from the Southern Ocean, marking the fleet’s shortest ever season [1].
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas said the early return of Japan's whaling fleet was good news for whales and conservationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not over yet, but, today’s announcement by Japan is rewarding news for the many organisations, governments and people around the world that are working to end commercial whaling,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junichi Sato, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan said; “This historic announcement confirms what we all know: that Japan’s whaling serves no purpose whatsoever and the fleet has no business in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the whaling programme has produced is a stockpile of thousands of tonnes of frozen whale meat,   the waste of billions of Japanese taxpayer’s yen, and a culture of corruption and scandal. An early return of the whaling fleet is not enough – Japan’s whaling ships should never leave port again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls show that over 70% of Japanese people do not support distant water hunting of whales far from Japan [2] Greenpeace has been working to expose the corruption that has helped sustain its commercial whaling programme, conducted under the guise of scientific research for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a Greenpeace investigation into whale meat embezzlement the Fisheries Agency of Japan recently admitted that five of its officials, who sailed with the whaling fleet to oversee its activities, had accepted expensive gifts of whale meat from the fleet’s operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Japanese public doesn’t want to be force-fed whale meat or be forced to bankroll a corrupt and dying industry,” added Sato. “Greenpeace is urging the Japanese Government to not only investigate the whale meat scandal we exposed three years ago, but also start taking real action towards protection of the world’s oceans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to all commercial whaling in all of the world's oceans and is working to end whaling in Japan by raising public awareness of the whaling industry's corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;NOTES TO EDITORS:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. This season’s whale hunt, which started in early December, has been the industry’s shortest: the fleet is usually at sea from November until April&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. A poll was commissioned by Greenpeace Japan in 2008, prepared by Nippon Research Center Ltd. (part of the Gallup International Association) and can be found at http://www.greenpeace.org/international/japanpoll&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland – Monday July 16 2007 - Greenpeace today released an updated version of its Clean Energy Guide, which ranks New Zealand electricity companies on their current and future contribution to climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Auckland - Monday July 16 2007 - Greenpeace today released an
updated version of its Clean Energy Guide, which ranks New Zealand
electricity companies on their current and future contribution to
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide - the first of which was released in 2005 - helps New
Zealanders make the switch to a cleaner electricity supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders' concern about climate change has reached an all
time high (1)," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Susannah Bailey.
"People want to see the Government and industry taking action, but
they also want to take action themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This guide gives them the opportunity to make an important
change, and by doing so, they encourage energy companies to do the
right thing and invest in renewable energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide ranks each company that feeds into the national grid
according to its current supply and future commitment to clean,
renewable energy. This edition also takes into account each
company's energy efficiency programmes and whether they encourage
households to generate their own renewable electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis Energy ranks worst this time round, replacing Mighty
River Power (and their retail brand Mercury Energy) as the company
whose policies and practices are the least mindful of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Genesis gets the worst ranking because it owns the Huntly coal
fired power station, the biggest point source of carbon dioxide in
the country, and because most of its future plans involve fossil
fuels, for example the Rodney gas project," said Ms Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River and Mercury Energy have improved their ranking
because they dropped their plans to recommission the Marsden B
Power Station in Northland on coal. Part of the reason they did so
was because of consumer pressure from the first Clean Energy
Guide."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meridian Energy remains the best ranked company, because all its
electricity is currently generated from renewable sources and it
has made a commitment to only use renewable sources in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susannah Bailey said it had been encouraging to notice an
overall shift in electricity sector attitudes, as companies respond
to public and political concerns (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But some companies still have their head in the sand over
climate change and all of them have room for improvement. For
example Meridian is one of only two companies which don't encourage
households to generate their own renewable energy by allowing them
to feed excess electricity generation back into the network and be
paid for that generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's inevitable that all electricity companies will have to
make changes in the coming years, and putting those changes off
isn't helping them or the country. Greenpeace's report, New Zealand
Energy Revolution: How to prevent climate chaos (3) shows it's
entirely possible for New Zealand to achieve a 100% renewable
electricity supply by 2025. The sooner we start the shift the
better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Bailey said while it was crucial for energy companies to step
up to the plate over the problem, it was equally important for the
government to put decisive, effective measures in place to reduce
New Zealand's emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If we want to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts, we
need to reduce emissions 30% from 1990 levels by 2020 and 90% by
2050. We need all our political leaders to agree to set emission
reduction targets, put a price on all greenhouse gas pollution and
set policies to encourage renewable energy and energy
efficiency."&lt;/p&gt;

A 2007 Moxie Solution Seekers Survey found 83 per cent of New Zealanders are aware of the significant problems the world faces as a result of global warming. A ShapeNZ poll has found 89 per cent of New Zealanders think climate change is a problem, with 74 per cent saying it must to be managed now (35 per cent said urgently).

(2)For example, Contact is planning to invest only in renewable sources until 2008, and has developed a plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. They cited consumer pressure as one of the reasons for this change.  But Contact still owns large gas power stations which also contribute to climate change and they have more gas plans for the future, hence their poor rating. Mercury Energy (the retail brand for Mighty River) has improved their ranking more than Contact, so that has shifted Contact into a worse ranking.

	Greenpeace activists smeared in fake oil have greeted guests arriving at the part-Statoil sponsored Petroleum Summit dinner this evening.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six activists, looking like they had swum through an oil spill, lined up outside the entrance to the Auckland Museum Event Centre and called on the Statoil to abandon its plans to drill for deep sea oil off the coast of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Norwegian oil giant has been granted a &lt;a href="http://www.statoil.com/en/about/worldwide/newzealand/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;15-year exploration permit&lt;/a&gt; for the Northland basin which lies off the coast of Ahipara beach. It will be looking to drill between 1,000 and 2,000 metres below the ocean surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Kiwis don't want Statoil drilling off our coastlines risking our beaches and economy,” says Greenpeace NZ Chief Political Advisor Nathan Argent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A computer &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/press/Deep-sea-oil-blowout-could-decimate-favourite-kiwi-beaches/"&gt;oil spill modelling report&lt;/a&gt; , carried out by data scientists using industry standard data and released by Greenpeace last year, shows a deep-sea blowout could have devastating impacts on New Zealand's coastal waters and significant economic consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government does not have a mandate to open up our oceans and drill for oil. A majority of Kiwis want to see the government invest in cleaner, smarter energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier today seven Greenpeace activists disrupted a speech by Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges at the start of the conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven activists displaying banners reading ‘No deep sea oil’ and ‘Stop Statoil’ and creating noise with alarms forced a delay as Mr Bridges was speaking to about 400 oil industry representatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		Greenpeace International understands that supporters and donors will rightly be surprised and disappointed by the loss of 3.8 million euros as a consequence of foreign currency exchange management contracts currently being reported by the media. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We offer a full apology to our supporters for the series of errors that led to the loss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We further wish to reassure people that every possible action is being taken to avoid the possibility of such a loss ever occurring again in future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a global organisation active in more than 55 countries, Greenpeace International is funded with many different currencies, valuations of which can change rapidly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The losses are a result of a serious error of judgment by an employee in our International Finance Unit acting beyond the limits of their authority and without following proper procedures. Greenpeace International entered into contracts to buy foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate while the euro was gaining in strength. This resulted in a loss of 3.8 million euros against a range of other currencies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the staff member thought he was acting in the best interest of the organisation and there is no evidence of personal gain he has since been relieved of his position. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are continuing to explore all options in relation to the error and process failures. We are confident that steps already taken to improve financial controls mean this could not happen again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenpeace International Board has ordered a complete independent audit to determine how the incident took place and to improve internal procedures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International’s 2013 Annual Report, to be published soon, will show a budget deficit of 6.8 million euros for the year. This deficit includes the loss of 3.8 million euros from an ill judged contract aimed at managing foreign currency exchange costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International had income of 72.9 million euros in 2013 out of a global budget of around 300 million euros.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace can only exist thanks to the trust supporters place in us. To maintain our independence, we do not accept donations from governments or corporations and rely instead on millions of individual supporters around the world. We are extremely grateful for their contributions and are determined to ensure their trust is not misplaced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will make adjustments for these losses in the coming two or three years by amending planned infrastructure investments. No money will be taken from our frontline campaigning to protect the climate, our oceans, rainforests and precious natural environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For further information please contact:&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International press desk (media only please)  +31 (0) 20 718 24 70&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            As Greenpeace activists ocupy the proposed  Marsden B coal fired power station, the the sun rises over the beach on the day the Kyoto Protocol comes into force in Ruakaka, New Zealand.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid said that since we
signed Kyoto New Zealand could have been steadily reducing
emissions. But no policies were yet in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since Kyoto, we have sat back smugly, relying totally on
forests to soak up carbon, and not lifting a finger to reduce our
actual greenhouse gas emissions else. This has made us the 7th
worst country in the OECD for emission increases," said Greenpeace
Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In 1995, we warned the Government (1) that if it relied on
forests to soak up our emissions, it would end up in big trouble. 
And that's exactly where we are today," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She pointed out that not a single policy was yet in place to
encourage New Zealand to reduce its C02 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Judging by the Government's current proposals, we cannot expect
any policies to deliver emissions reductions until at least 2012.
In this time, we can only expect our liaibility to continue to go
up," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace said the Government needs to introduce a bold package
of policy measures to reduce emissions and called for a carbon tax
to be introduced immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

	In proposing approval for genetically engineered brassica field trials at Lincoln College, ERMA has incorrectly applied the HSNO Act on a number of different levels, bringing its objectivity into question, Greenpeace said today.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of ERMA's four-day hearing of submissions
on the NZ Institute for Crop &amp;amp; Food Research Ltd's application
to undertake a ten year, four ha field trial of GE broccoli,
cauliflower cabbage and kale at Lincoln. &amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's submission was presented by Duncan Currie, an
international expert in genetic engineering law. He challenged
ERMA's recommendation to approve the application, and noted that
ERMA had never yet turned down a GE field trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ERMA has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Misapplied the Act and Methodology to assess both uncertainty
and risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Failed to properly assess the opportunity cost in the sense of
lost funding to other non-GE research&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• incorrectly scoped risks, costs and benefits according to the
HSNO Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ERMA has said that wider environmental impacts of GE
brassica cannot be assessed in one small field trial, it then goes
on to claim there may be wider scientific benefits. It then talks
of "managing" the risk rather than giving an assessment of what the
risks are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Currie argued that ERMA had concluded that the environmental
effects of the trial would be negligible, because they were 'highly
unlikely' to arise in the context of this field trial and if they
did, they could be contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential environmental risks include contamination of
non-GE crops, the development of insect resistance to the Bt toxin
(one of the few pesticides available to organic farmers), effects
on non-target insects such as butterflies, and the escape of the
genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"ERMA can't have it both ways - they either make an assessment
of the wider environmental risks and costs as well as the benefits,
or they don't look any wider than this particular field trial at
all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, saying that risk can be managed does nothing to
assess what that risk may be. This is not the way the Act has been
written, and ERMA has made a serious mistake in its
interpretation," said Currie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Trials to test insect resistance to GE Bt brassica are a waste
of both time and money. The research around the world for Bt
Brassica already showed that insects build up resistance, the
consumer doesn't want it; farmers won't grow it, and certainly
can't sell it. Greenpeace calls on the Government to put money into
productive research instead."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace noted that ERMA had never turned down a GE field
trial application and called on the Government to turn this one
down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The appearance is that any application, no matter how
misconceived, how pointless and no matter what level of opposition,
will be approved. It is time to correct that apprehension," said
Currie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Contact: to get in touch with Duncan Currie call Cindy Baxter 021 772 661&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exp. contact date:&lt;/b&gt; 2007-04-12 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;

	The endangered tropical hardwood kwila faces extinction in the wild within 35 years, a Greenpeace report has found.  Yet in New Zealand the Government doesn't even track how much is coming into the country, let alone regulate it.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"At a press conference in Beijing, Greenpeace today released
"Merbau's Last Stand"(1), an investigative report which reveals the
smuggling methods being used to bring the endangered tree species
merbau (known as kwila in New Zealand), into China. The report
sounds the alarm bell for the future of kwila and the Paradise
Forests of Asia Pacific. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Indonesia banning the export of logs, Greenpeace
researchers found that in 2006 thousands of cubic meters of logs
entered ports in China from Indonesia. They are containerized and
falsely labelled as sawn timber; imported with forged documentation
labelling the timber as Malaysian, (despite the fact that Malaysia
has virtually wiped out its own kwila) and kwila logs are also
imported from illegal logging concessions in Papua New Guinea (2).
"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New maps produced by Greenpeace (3) show that 83% of the forests
housing the last healthy populations of merbau on New Guinea island
have already been allocated for logging, and only 17% is, for the
moment, not on the chopping block&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand forests campaigner Grant Rosoman said
kwila is by far the main tropical timber imported into New Zealand;
virtually all of it is illegal from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea,
but NZ customs codes and statistics don't record it separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Neither the Government nor the timber trade knows how much
illegal timber and wood products are imported into New Zealand
every year.  Not only is the Government complicit in this illegal
trade by doing nothing to stop it, but they also have no data on
the scale of the problem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace estimates that at least NZ$15-20 million of kwila
sawn timber, decking and outdoor furniture is imported into New
Zealand every year. According to the Ministry of Forestry
statistics the imports of wooden furniture have increased four fold
in recent years to a value of over $150 million annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is part of this potential species extinction
&amp;amp;#150; but the Government doesn't even track it.  Even
Australian customs has a specific number and category for kwila
imports &amp;amp;#150; but our Customs codes are stuck back in the
1970's," he said. "It's clear that both Customs and the timber
importers do not want to deal with this problem, which is why we
need strong regulation," he said. "Even if the Government wanted to
control the import of kwila, it wouldn't have a clue how much is
coming in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the current trends are not reversed, even at the current
legally approved rates of logging, kwila will be extinct in the
wild within 35 years. The global illegal trade means we'll lose it
much sooner than that &amp;amp;#150; and New Zealand's imports
contribute to the problem."&lt;/p&gt;

	While it is clear New Zealand is going to have to gear up to adapt to the effects of climate change, the Government´s proposed policies to reduce emissions are simply not enough, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The IPCC's Australia and New Zealand chapter detailed today
showed that a huge area of New Zealand, from Northland to the Bay
of Plenty would be hit by increased rainfall.  Other impacts would
see water shortages in key agricultural areas, along with increased
risk of new pests to agriculture, and major biodiversity loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After attending the NIWA briefing on the impacts of climate
change in New Zealand this morning, Greenpeace climate campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson called on the Government to beef up its proposed
policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is well behind the game on reducing greenhouse
pollution.  We need to put a price on all greenhouse gases right
across New Zealand well before 2012, rather than the current
proposals of simply concentrating on just our major energy
companies until that time," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A first step would be putting in place targets for emissions
reductions and timetables to reach those targets," she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace reiterated its call for the Government to adopt a
target of a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas pollution on
1990 levels by 2020, and a 90 per cent reduction by 2050.   This
was achievable, as outlined in Greenpeace&amp;amp;acute;s Energy
Revolution Report (1) released in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emissions could be stabilised from both the electricity and
transport sectors by 2020 and could be cut by 72 per cent by
2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand can and must achieve a 100 per cent renewable
electricity system by 2025, but we need the policies and incentives
to achieve this," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) Download the NZ"&amp;gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/press/reports/nz-energy-revolution-report&amp;gt;NZ energy report here&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called on the New Zealand Government to heed OECD calls released today for the country to adopt a "clear and comprehensive package of climate change policy measures".

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This latest call from the OECD Environmental Performance
Review, is an embarrassment for New Zealand and demonstrates just
how behind the game New Zealand is on addressing climate change
&amp;amp;#150; the greatest challenge facing the planet," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OECD recommends that New Zealand develop a comprehensive
climate change policy package and ensure that the "agricultural
sector reduces it greenhouse gas emissions".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, no climate polluting sector can be exempt from action
on climate change and that includes the agricultural sector as well
as transport and energy emissions, which have also sparked concern
from the OECD," said Atkinson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is critical of New Zealand&amp;amp;acute;s dumping of its
climate change policy package in 2005, including the carbon charge
and warns that the country has very little experience in using the
Kyoto flexible mechanisms (such as carbon credits and the Clean
Development Mechanism), which New Zealand is likely to need to meet
its Kyoto targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also highlights that the greenhouse gas intensity of the New
Zealand economy is fourth highest in the OECD, that greenhouse
pollution has climbed since 1996 and points to a worrying trend of
increasing carbon intensity in our electricity system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is going in the wrong direction on climate change
and this latest warning from the international community puts
further pressure on the Government to get it right on climate
change and get it right fast," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government must put a price on greenhouse gas pollution
across the economy by 2008, establish targets to reduce greenhouse
pollution by 30 per cent by 2020, aim for 100 per cent renewable
electricity by 2025, phase out existing coal stations like Huntly
and put in place policies to encourage renewable energy such as a
guaranteed pricing scheme, as well as energy efficiency and public
transport," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace report New Zealand Energy Revolution: How to
prevent climate chaos, released in February, demonstrates how New
Zealand can reduce its greenhouse pollution in the energy sector
without damaging the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner    021 565 165&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            TOKYO, JAPAN, 1st of April, 2007 The Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza sailed into Yokohama Bay this morning after spending 6 days drifting off the coast off Tokyo after being effectively banned by the All Japan Seamen's Union for the organisations position on whaling. Greenpeace worked directly with the authorities to circumvent the block. Here the Japanese pilot boat escorts the Esperanza into port after its tour of the Southern Ocean where they responded to distress calls of the whaling ship Nisshin Maru. The Esperanza has just completed a world tour to defend the planets oceans and to highlight issues such as whaling, over fishing, and pollution. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace staff in Tokyo and crew on board the Esperanza have
spent nearly  a week  lobbying diplomats, unions and the coastguard
in order to work  around the actions of the All Japan Seamen's
Union, which resulted in  cooperation from ships agents being
formally withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace circumvented normal procedures by organizing all the
relevant paperwork and support itself - a task the organisation was
originally told was not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely happy to be coming into Japan and to have the
opportunity to engage in debate and dialogue about the issue of
high seas whaling," said Sara Holden, on board the Esperanza. "We
did not give up hope that we would be able to get in and we hope
the fact that many people were still prepared to help us sends a
clear signal that Greenpeace is welcome in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship, which was flying banners that read "We Love
Japan, But  Not Whaling in a Sanctuary" in Japanese and English,
will spend a number of  days in Japan. Officials from the Fisheries
Agency of Japan and the  Institute for Cetacean research have been
invited on board the Esperanza to discuss the Japanese government's
whaling programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the publication of his book on the issue, the
Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan, Jun Hoshikawa said: "One
government official  has already commented on what a pity it is
that the debate on whaling is so  limited. Now is the time to
change that situation. We began a ship-to-ship dialogue in the
Southern Ocean and now we will bring that dialogue ship to
shore."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza spent seven weeks in the Southern Ocean during the
last whaling season, during which time the ship and crew remained
on standby close to the fire-damaged whaling factory vessel Nisshin
Maru. Help was offered to and accepted by the expedition leader of
the fleet and the  Greenpeace helicopter was used to carry out
surveys of the encroaching ice and report them back to the disabled
ship.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand Governments announcement today to close 32 per cent of our EEZ to bottom trawling does little to stop the destruction of vulnerable deep-sea life threatened by the practice, this is clearly illustrated by a map released by Greenpeace in August 2006 shows. (1)
&lt;div&gt;

            Map of areas proposed by the NZ fishing industry to be closed to bottom trawling compared to where bottom trawling actually occurs.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace took a Ministry of Fisheries 'trawling map' which
shows where the fishing industry has been bottom trawling (2), and
overlaid it over the fishing industry's map of its closures (3).
Although there are new areas added to the proposal it is nowhere
near the science based protection that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map shows that most areas proposed for closure are either
too deep or too rough to bottom trawl, or are otherwise of no
interest to the fishing industry because they don't contain enough
bottom-trawled target fish, such as orange roughy, to be economical
as fishing areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace welcomes science-based industry initiatives to close
areas to bottom trawling, but the Governments initiative does
nothing to protect areas that are currently being destroyed," said
Mike Hagler, Greenpeace oceans campaigner. "Most of the areas
proposed for closure are of no interest to the fishing industry,
there aren't enough fish."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also criticised the lack of a real consultation
process from the Government in drafting this proposal and said
"it's been back room deals between the Minister and the fishing
industry and environmental groups have had little consultation".
Over 1600 people who sent submissions to the Government will be
disappointed today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Mike Hagler, Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner, 021 321 379&lt;br&gt;

	Greenpeace lawyer Duncan Currie and Campaign Manager Cindy Baxter today delivered Greenpeace’s oral submission in support of the proposed wind farm at Makara – Meridian’s West Wind.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"In our submission we highlight that both climate change and the
benefits of renewable energy are key matters to which this
Committee should pay particular regard in considering this wind
farm," says Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UK's leading scientist, Sir David King has said that
climate change is "the most serious issue facing us this century
and beyond."  With our exceptional wind resources such as here in
Wellington, New Zealand has many clean, renewable options for
meeting our future electricity needs without burning polluting coal
and gas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"West Wind will power up to 110,000 Wellington, Porirua and
Lower Hutt homes without harming the climate - that's exactly the
direction New Zealand should be going in terms of energy.  Wind is
a technology that has come of age and it's a direct alternative to
new coal fired generation such as Marsden B with its raft of
negative health, visual, economic and environmental impacts," said
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West Wind will avoid the emission of 520,000 tonnes of carbon
dioxide per&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;year if the electricity were to be generated using coal.  
That's the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;equivalent to taking 120,000 cars off the road every year or
planting 777,000 trees (according to EECA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that to really drive renewable energy
development, the Government must create stronger incentives and
policies and map out a long-term sustainable energy strategy for
the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand needs a diverse mix of renewable energy sources,
including projects such as West Wind, but also smaller, distributed
generation located close to demand.  With existing hydro, new small
hydro, geothermal, biomass, solar, wind, energy efficiency and
conservation measures we can move towards a 100% renewable energy
system and rule out the need for polluting and climate offending
coal and gas generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also urged the Commissioners to address environmental
impacts such as earthworks and the possible effects of
sedimentation, and other ecological issues through effective and
appropriately worded conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Greenpeace today urged the New Zealand business sector to wake up and accept that a cost on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions is inevitable.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Today we have seen business screaming about the idea that they
will have to pay for their greenhouse pollution. They need to wake
up to the fact that climate change is happening, we're causing it
and the best way to reduce emissions is to put a price on carbon,"
said Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace NZ climate campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the polluter doesn't pay for their emissions, the taxpayer
will have to, both now and in the cost of dealing with the impacts
of climate change. Every one of us has to take action, and the
sooner we start, the better," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that the report by the UK's Sir Nicholas Stern last
year warned that the longer we wait, the more it will cost to cut
our greenhouse gas emissions, and that if we do nothing, there will
be an even bigger cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tide of public opinion on climate change has turned - the
sooner NZ business accepts the reality, the sooner we can get on
with tackling climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, which helped the fire-damaged Japanese whaling factory ship when it was disabled in the Southern Ocean, has been effectively banned from entry into Tokyo.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The fire-damaged whaling factory ship, the Nisshin Maru enters Tokyo's bay.
Greenpeace's ship, Esperanza, was in the Antarctic to stop the hunt in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, but instead stayed with the Nisshin Maru, assisting with safety for the crew and the whole fleet.
Greenpeace is calling for the  Nisshin Maru to be retired from the whaling fleet and for the government to give a full public account of the cause of the fire that left one man dead and the ship crippled in the icy Southern Ocean for ten days.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Esperanza less than a day's sailing from port, the All
Japan Seamen's Union (AJSU) visited the Greenpeace ship's agent and
subsequently the agent formally withdrew services for the ship -
preventing her from coming into port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AJSU has falsely accused Greenpeace - an international
environmental organisation with a core principle of non-violence -
of being a terrorist organisation and also of collaborating with
the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, whose ship collided with one
of the whaling ships in the Southern Ocean last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The AJSU is simply playing politics and using intimidation to
shut down legitimate dialogue," said Sara Holden, of Greenpeace
International, on board the Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace has brought its ship to Tokyo in an effort to open
dialogue with the government and its whaling agencies. If they have
nothing to hide then there is no reason not to let us in. But it is
clearly in their interest to keep the public ignorant of what is
really going on."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent critique by an International Whaling Commission
review panel of the Japanese government's so-called " scientific"
whaling programme, the scientists concluded that the whaling
programme, which has run for 18 years and hunted nearly 7,000
whales, did not reach any of its key objectives, including
establishing population figures and mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent opinion poll showed that 92% of Japanese people do not
know the scale of the government hunt in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary. Of those that do, more than two-thirds do not support
the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;

	The fire-damaged whaling factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, returned to port in Tokyo in the last hour, just days after an International Whaling Commission review of the Japanese government's so-called "research" programme (1) showed that virtually nothing has been learnt about whale populations in the Southern Ocean in 18 years of hunting.

            Nisshin Maru, det japanske hvalfangst-skib, der brød I brand I Sydhavet 15. februar, ankommer til Tokyobugten.
Greenpeace-skibet Esoeranza befandt sig i Sydhavet samtidig med den japanske hvalfangstflåde for at stoppe jagten i hvalreservatet Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Da Nisshin Maru kom i bekneb tilbød Greenpeaces besætning at hjælpe men fik afslag. Trods det blev Greenpeace-skibet hele tiden i nærheden for at give en hånd, hvis de alligevel var behov for det.
Greenpeace appellerer nu til de japanske myndigheder om at tage Nisshin Maru ud af hvalfangstflåden.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JARPA whaling research programme review workshop report (2)
states that the program cannot even establish reliable mortality
rates for Minke whales, despite this being a prime objective of the
program, and the statistical analysis cannot rule out a zero
mortality rate - which would make Minke whales immortal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the four objectives of the JARPA program, which involved
harpooning 6,778 whales, was reached. Attempts to determine if
populations were increasing or decreasing also failed.  The
workshop "noted that the current confidence intervals for the
estimates of trend are relatively wide. These results are,
therefore, consistent with a substantial decline, a substantial
increase, or approximate stability in minke whale abundance in
these geographic areas over the period of JARPA." (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is not only the Japanese government's factory whaling ship
that has been seriously damaged this hunting season, so has the
credibility of the whaling programme with this review," said
Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan Whale Campaign Coordinator. "The
Japanese people have spent 18 years and millions of yen funding a
so-called research programme that has produced nothing of
substance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for the  Nisshin Maru to be retired from
the whaling fleet and for the government to give a full public
account of the cause of the fire that left one man dead and the
ship crippled in the icy Southern Ocean for ten days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's ship, Esperanza, was in the Antarctic to stop the
hunt in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, but instead stayed with
the Nisshin Maru, assisting with safety for the crew and the whole
fleet by maintain regular ice surveys with the Greenpeace
helicopter and offering additional emergency aid. Once the ship was
operational again the Esperanza escorted the entire fleet out of
Antarctic waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza, which is an ice-class vessel and files
environmental impact assessments with Antarctic Treaty nations -
unlike the Japanese whaling fleet- is now en route to Tokyo and is
scheduled to be in Tokyo Bay on March 28th. Greenpeace has invited
representatives from the Fisheries Agency of Japan and the
Institute of Cetacean Research on board the Esperanza to discuss
high seas whaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; 1.    Japanese special permit research in the Antarctic (JARPA) was an 18 year program carried out from 1987/88 to 2004/05 and took 6,778 minke whales over that period. The IWC repeatedly asked Japan to call off the program, as the data was not needed and recommended that scientific research involving the killing of cetaceans should only be permitted where critically important research needs are addressed.

2.    The JARPA review workshop was convened under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee and was held in Tokyo, 4-8 December, 2006 at the Institute of Cetacean Research. It was attended by 56 scientists including 29 from Japan and the Chair of the IWC's Scientific Committee. The main objective of the Workshop was to evaluate how well the objectives of JARPA had been met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exp. contact date:&lt;/b&gt; 2007-04-26 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;

	Environmental activists gathered this morning outside the old town hall in Wellington with model wind turbines in tow to support a proposal to build New Zealand’s biggest wind farm on the western coast of Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of the resource consent hearing for
Meridian Energy's 'West Wind' project. At 210 megawatts it will be
able to power 110,000 homes in the Wellington, Porirua and Lower
Hutt region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not only will West Wind utilise Wellington's excellent wind
resource for clean renewable electricity generation but the scale
of the project demonstrates that wind energy can produce sizeable
chunks of our electricity demand," said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Rather than more polluting coal-fired power stations like
Mighty River Power's proposed Marsden B near Whangarei, West Wind
is exactly the sort of clean energy solution the world needs to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and avoid dangerous climate
change," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and WWF New Zealand volunteers erected 7 model wind
turbines and held banners which read 'Absolutely, Positively Wind'
and 'Yes to Wind'. They also handed out leaflets urging
Wellingtonians to support wind energy for their region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having one of the best wind energy resources on the
planet, New Zealand has lagged behind in embracing the world's
fastest growing energy sector. Greenpeace believes that to really
drive renewable energy development the Government must create
stronger incentives and policies and map out a long-term
sustainable energy strategy for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand needs a diverse mix of renewable energy sources,
including projects such as West Wind, but also smaller distributed
generation located close to demand. With existing hydro, new small
hydro, geothermal, biomass, solar, wind, energy efficiency and
conservation measures we can move towards a 100% renewable energy
system and rule out the need for polluting and climate offending
coal and gas generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northland Regional Council's decision on Marsden B is due
out later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

Due to relentless campaigning by lots of different people, Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal fired power station proposal was abandoned in March 2007.

Greenpeace today condemned the decision by Commissioners acting for two Northland Councils for allowing Marsden B coal fired power station to go ahead.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The decision is one giant leap backwards, back to out dated,
polluting energy sources. It is a terrible blow for the
environment, for the local community and for efforts to tackle the
world's greatest threat - climate change," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"With New Zealand set to overshoot our Kyoto greenhouse gas
reduction targets, and scientists are warning us that we have only
10 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it is ridiculous to allow
the country's first coal-fired power station in 25 years."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace thinks that the Commissioners have misread the
Resource Management Act by ignoring climate change, as the Act does
provide for this vital matter to be considered (1).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marsden B would annually release up to 2.17 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide and Greenpeace's evidence in the hearings also
highlighted the risks to human health and the environment from
mercury, dioxin and sulphur emissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The Commissioners' claim, that this power station would have
the most stringent environmental controls of any coal plant in
Australasia. However, the best of a dirty bunch is still dirty,"
said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Marsden B would be so polluting it would never get approved in
the US, Japan, Germany or Sweden according to evidence presented to
the hearing by a world-renowned scientist with over 35 years of
experience in environmental assessment of power plants, Dr Phyllis
Fox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"This decision shows how dirty and polluting coal is (2). The
Commissioners have set a limit of just under 3kg of mercury
emissions per year when Mighty River Power asked for 35kg. Yet the
average annual emission levels of Mighty River's preferred coal
type would be 14kg, almost 5 times the level they have been
allowed.   Mercury emissions also vary dramatically:  up to a
maximum of 168kg could be emitted per year from their preferred
coal type and even more for other coals. "Mighty River Power will
really struggle to meet the mercury limits with any coal," said
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mercury would be discharged into an environment where local
snapper are already at the upper limit of mercury levels safe for
human consumption.  "In this case, Mighty River Power had not even
undertaken studies to find out how much mercury is in the Bream Bay
marine life. To add even the amount of mercury permitted in this
consent in these circumstances is a completely unacceptable
risk."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"In this age of climate change, New Zealand does not need a
great big, carbon-belching, toxic emitting power station. We need
clean renewable energy and a long term sustainable energy strategy
to get us there," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also pointed out the irony of the Marsden B decision
being released on the day that hearings begin in Wellington for New
Zealand's biggest wind farm, West Wind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's call for a sustainable, long term energy strategy
was supported today by the New Zealand Business Council on
Sustainable Development report on energy scenarios. However their
preferred scenario relies on experimental technology to capture and
store carbon emissions. But a report (3) released today by world
experts on this experimental technology warns that it would likely
only be deployed at a large scale in the second half of this
century.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand needs to address climate change and protect our
environment and human health by developing a long term strategy
encouraging renewable technology such as wind farms, stopping
climate-polluting power sources such as Marsden B and increasing
energy efficiency," concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Act allows climate change to be considered to the extent
that the development of renewable energy allows for greenhouse gas
reductions. Marsden B would shut out or hinder renewable energy
development, thereby impacting on greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Other problems include the up to 7.8 tonnes of sulphur
dioxide per day the plant will emit, again at the upper levels of
the national limits, and, depending on weather conditions, possibly
exceeding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage,
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agreed in Montreal over
the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed the Government’s announcement on a mandatory sales target for biofuels as a small step in the right direction.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"A target for 5% blended biodiesel and 3% ethanol blended petrol
from biomass sources, while not ambitious, is an urgently needed
step in the right direction to tackle climate change," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing
alarmingly and urgent steps are needed to get our emissions headed
in the opposite direction. Biofuels are a part of that solution but
must be combined with improved public transport systems and an
overall energy strategy to phase out fossil fuels, prevent new
coal-fired power stations like Marsden B, boost renewable energy
like wind and increase energy efficiency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is currently reviewing its climate change policies
and assessing how it will approach discussions at the first
official Kyoto Protocol meeting in December where the shape of the
future agreements will begin. It is vital that New Zealand supports
steps internationally to slow climate change and takes steps at
home to curb emissions from the electricity, transport and
agricultural sectors towards a low carbon economy. A sales target
for biofuels is a step on that path," concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today applauded the Environment Court's decision to allow the Awhitu wind farm, at Waiuku near Auckland to go ahead.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This decision is a fantastic signal for wind energy development
in New Zealand and is a great step towards reducing our greenhouse
gas emissions and tackling the world's biggest threat - climate
change," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a precedent setting case for wind energy in New Zealand.
It is the first time that a decision on a wind farm has been taken
to the Environment Court and it sets a positive precedent for
balancing sustainable development and the need to tackle climate
change with mitigating local impacts and for allowing appropriate
siting of wind farms in coastal areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined the appeal in support of the wind farm as we
were very concerned about climate change. Greenpeace believes that
wind and other forms of renewable energy are very important
components to address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is the Saudi Arabia of wind and a recent Government
study showed that 35% of our installed electricity capacity could
come from wind energy, and that is just within current technology
limits."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The transition to renewable energy such as wind, is absolutely
vital and Awhitu is an urgently needed step on that path. With
scientists warning that we only have 10 years to tackle climate
change to avoid wide-scale ecological, economic and social
disaster, we can no longer afford to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand faces some tough energy choices in the coming
years. We can move towards clean renewable energy sources such as
wind or we are left with dirty climate-change causing options like
Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal-fired power station," said Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand should be developing more projects close to areas
of high electricity demand like Auckland, to avoid the need for
transmission line upgrades," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace run website, http://www.Yes2Wind.co.nz supports
and promotes the use of wind power in New Zealand and provides
information on wind energy including debunking some common myths.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franklin District Council rejected Genesis' application for
resource consents for the windfarm on 9 September 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis appealed the decision on 27 September and then EECA
appealed on 7 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently many others have joined either or both of these
appeals including Greenpeace, Auckland Regional Council, Mighty
River Power, The New Zealand Wind Energy Association, the
Environmental Defence Society and local resident Charmaine Watts
(head of Waiuku in Support of Wind Energy).&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed Energy Minister David Parker’s announcement that an emissions trading regime could be up and running during 2008. But it warned against delays in including any one sector.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Minister has implied that, although all sectors will
eventually be covered by the scheme, different sectors may be
brought into it at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A delay in the agricultural sector bearing some costs for its
greenhouse pollution would spell disaster for New Zealand in terms
of meeting its Kyoto targets" said Greenpeace climate campaigner,
Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It would also undermine the credibility of the sector in key
markets," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Delaying bringing in any one sector is only going to open up
more finger-pointing, with each sector saying they don't want a
cost on their emissions until others do."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called for an economy-wide carbon charge to be put in place
while the final details of the trading scheme were sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The common sense solution is to set an economy-wide charge on
all greenhouse emissions immediately, and then phase in sector by
sector emissions trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That way all sectors can move with confidence that they are not
being 'singled out' and it begins to influence practices and
investment choices now, which is the only way we can cut our
greenhouse pollution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Vanessa Atkinson, Climate Campaigner, 021 565 165

	Three of New Zealand's biggest national conservation and environmental organisations are urging voters to consider the country's long term future at this election.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Environment and Conservation Organisations of New Zealand (ECO),
the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society (Forest and Bird) and
Greenpeace New Zealand today launched the Vote for the
Environment's rating of political parties' environment and
conservation policies ahead of the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People are starting to get sick of the tax cut bidding war. We
want the political parties to take a more expansive view of New
Zealand's future; one that reflects our role as caretakers of a
unique set of islands - and a special way of life that celebrates
the beaches, the bush and the mountains," said Kevin Hackwell,
Forest &amp;amp; Bird campaign manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groups today released a wallet-sized card that rates the
political parties across 12 environment and conservation issues
that are important to New Zealanders.  They asked the parties a
total of 59 questions.   The parties scored the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Act: 10%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Green:  97%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Labour:  61%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Maori:  83%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * National:  43%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * NZ First:  50%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Progressive: 81%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * United Future: 48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result shows a fairly clear difference between the two major
parties on environmental issues for this election.  These
differences are reflected in the smaller parties, roughly falling
into the same camps as their likely choice of coalition
partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some of the responses were surprising - for example National's
endorsement of the Department of Conservation which stands in
contrast to the approach Don Brash took recently at Molesworth and
National's policy of opening conservation land to 'multiple use'
development" said Hackwell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That only a few of our political parties actually believe in
the science of climate change is pretty scary," said Cindy Baxter,
Greenpeace campaign manager.  "This is one of the most critical
environmental issues facing us, yet many parties, led by National's
'Donosaur', appear to be hell bent on making us international
pariahs by denying the science and pulling out of Kyoto."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's a major shift in National's policy away from the strong
protection of Antarctica that it previously expounded," said Cath
Wallace of ECO.  "National used to be a leader in Antarctic
Protection but this is a surprising rollback."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can see a very high level of consensus for the Ministry of
Fisheries better implementing its legal environmental
responsibilities, and to see MPA's properly defined.  However, when
it comes to more specific measures such as a global moratorium on
high seas bottom trawling, the major parties are not trustworthy,"
she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two major parties both score very poorly on GE and Toxics.
Both also support changes to the RMA to fast-track major
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today condemned National’s plan to axe the carbon tax as part of their tax package announced yesterday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"National is cynically trying to buy votes by promising to axe
the carbon tax if they're elected. But they have completely ignored
the costs that all New Zealanders will have to bear from climate
change with increased droughts, floods, sea level rise and new
pests and diseases," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Proposing to axe the carbon tax is a step backwards when the
world's climate scientists say that we urgently need deep cuts in
greenhouse gas emissions of 60-80% by the middle of this century if
we are to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The carbon tax is a small but important first step as part of a
responsible response to the biggest threat the world faces -
climate change. Yet National is prepared to gamble with every New
Zealander's future by proposing to ditch the tax and pull out of
the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only legally binding agreement on
climate change."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"National's short-sighted policies on energy and the climate
would put our country and our economy at risk," concluded Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientific community and governments around the globe agree;
climate change is happening now, it is caused by burning fossil
fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy and we need deep cuts in
our greenhouse emissions if we are to avoid climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Greenpeace today condemned National's new energy policy as backward and dangerous as it ignores renewable energy and the reality of climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"National has plumbed new depths in its energy policy. In
spectacular fashion they have managed to ignore any mention of the
climate change, the environment or sustainability. 'Renewable
energy' also seems to be sorely missing from National's policy
vocabulary, because it certainly doesn't rate a mention in either
their climate or energy policies," said climate campaigner, Vanessa
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific community and governments around the globe agree;
climate change is happening now, it is caused by burning fossil
fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy and we need deep cuts in
our greenhouse emissions if we are to avoid climate disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month the predictions from scientists get more and more
dire. New Zealand faces more extreme weather events like droughts
and floods, longer and more intense forest fire risk, sea level
rise, new agricultural pests and the occurrence of tropical
diseases like malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is outrageous that a political party could still fail to
make any connection between energy and climate change. The two are
fundamentally linked".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National's policy on energy also completely ignores renewable
energy. Yet New Zealand has one of the best renewable energy
resources on the planet. Wind energy is the fastest growing energy
sector in the world, and alone could comprise 35% of our
electricity capacity with existing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as wind, New Zealand also has an abundance of renewable
hydro, biomass and solar resources which National has ignored in
favour of unsustainable sources like coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National wants to gamble with our future, by pushing us down a
polluting energy path of more coal fired power stations which will
lead to more dangerous climate change - the biggest threat the
world faces," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urgently need a sustainable energy strategy for New Zealand
to make a transition to renewable energy sources and energy
efficiency conservation requirements, with a phase out of coal and
fossil fuel electricity generation, to help avoid dangerous climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National's energy policy is cold comfort to any one concerned
about the environment or climate change," concluded Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Greenpeace congratulated the Minister of Fisheries for taking the issue of bottom trawling and New Zealand's role in governance of international waters seriously, following the release of Labour's Fisheries Policy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Labour's Fisheries Policy has the potential to be a
far-reaching, intelligent response to the crisis our oceans are in.
Overall, if implemented, Labour's policies give the opportunity for
ocean life to return to a healthy state", said oceans campaigner
Malcolm Wren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour is indicating it wants to take a vocal lead on the
"unacceptable impacts of bottom trawling" at the UN. The UNGA
meeting at New York in November offers the opportunity to put their
money where their mouth is on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This can only be applauded", says Mr Wren, "But negotiations
with Chile and Australia over managing the oceans in between will
take years while every day bottom trawlers are destroying unique,
essential habitats and ecosystems in the deep sea. That's why a UN
moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters needs to be
in place while the talks continue".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace compliments policies to tackle illegal, unreported,
and unregulated (IUU) fishing and support marine reserves in the
high seas and the fragile waters of Antarctica as all positive
initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Comparatively, the National Party hasn't even grasped that the
most destructive fishing technique in the world - bottom trawling -
is even an issue. There are no suggestions to fix the environmental
impacts of industrial fishing such as bycatch and marine habitat
destruction", concluded Mr Wren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, National's Fisheries Policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not recognise the spiral of collapse that the fishing
industry and ocean life is experiencing is due to destructive
fishing techniques and industrial overfishing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Does not advocate the precautionary principle and is hostile to
urgently-needed marine reserves&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In contrast to Labour, wants to promote New Zealand's fishing
interests in the Antarctic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Leading scientists - warning ‘a screaming siren’</title><date>2007-02-03 00:00:00</date><text>
	Greenpeace challenged Governments to step up to the plate and take immediate action, after the strongest warnings yet from the international scientific community on the threat of dangerous climate change unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The latest report on the science of climate change from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting in Paris,
concludes that continuing business-as-usual practices are likely to
increase global average temperatures between 1.1°C and 6.4° C above
1980-1999 levels by 2095, leading to more droughts, heatwaves,
floods and stronger hurricanes, rapid melting of ice-sheets and
rapidly rising sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The good news is our understanding of the climate system and
our impact on it has improved immensely. The bad news is that the
more we know, the more precarious the future looks. There's a clear
message to Governments here, and the window for action is narrowing
fast. If the last IPCC report was a wake up call, this one is a
screaming siren," said Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International
Climate &amp;amp; Energy Campaigner in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Some of the major findings include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human impact on climate has now been attributed with a 90%
confidence, higher than in earlier assessments, and has been found
in all world regions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An increase in the theoretical climate 'sensitivity', i.e., how
the climate will respond to a doubling of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere compared to pre-industrial levels. Previously, the best
estimate for warming in relation to GHG doubling was 2.5 degrees
centigrade, and now that has increased to 3 degrees
centigrade.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Broad confirmation that the range of warming expected by 2100
if emissions are not reduced is 1.1°C and 6.4°C by 2095 over
1980-1999 levels (1).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The intensity of tropical storms is likely to increase, a
finding that was not possible in the Third Assessment Report (TAR).
Observed increases in intensity are highly correlated with
increased sea surface temperature.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets contributed a
substantial amount (around 15%) to the observed increase in sea
level over the 1993-2003 period. However, the models say that the
Antarctic ice sheet should in fact be growing, due to increased
precipitation, meaning that as yet the models cannot explain the
increase in the discharge of ice especially from Antarctica, and
don't fully account for the rapid melting and discharge of ice from
Greenland. So, while it's known that sea-level rise will probably
be greater, it is still difficult to quantify precisely by how
much.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A warming of 1.9 to 4.6°C above pre-industrial levels, (well
within the range expected for the 21st century) would lead to the
virtual elimination of the Greenland Ice sheet, if that warming is
sustained for thousand years or more. That would raise sea level by
between 6 and 7 metres. The report also found that future
temperatures projected over Greenland are comparable to those from
a warm period 125, 000 years ago, when sea levels were 4-6 metres
higher than they are today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate chaos is on the increase, and we all must act to cut
global emissions to avoid total climate meltdown," said Atkinson.
"The time for excuses and delay is well and truly over. New Zealand
has an abundance of clean renewable energy available like wind and
solar. Using these, significantly increase energy efficiency and
conservation and phasing out polluting power sources like coal
would get us on the right track," said Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace
New Zealand climate campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the public to have there say on New
Zealand's energy future by making a submission to the Governments
proposed energy strategy currently under consideration. Submissions
close end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) This range is similar to that found in the IPCC Third
Assessment for the same scenarios of 1.4°C to 5.6°C by 2100 above
1990 levels. However, it cannot be compared directly with the new
range as the methods used are different and the time period is
slightly different. The new range covers temperature rise for the
decade from 2090-2099 over the average levels in the period from
1980-1999), whereas the TAR compared temperature rise in 2100
compared with 1990 levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; For further information please contact in Paris:&lt;br&gt;

Due to relentless campaigning by lots of different people, Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal fired power station proposal was abandoned in March 2007.

Greenpeace's bid to stop proposed coal fired power station Marsden B continued today by presenting a submission against Mighty River Powers (MRP) plan to put a coal conveyor belt across conservation land. (1) Greenpeace has been opposing any new coal fired power-stations because of dire warnings of climate chaos, which once again are being bought to global attention this week by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) currently meeting in Paris.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Marsden B must be rejected because of the impacts on our
climate. What we need in New Zealand are visionary government
policies that lead us to be using 100% renewable electricity, not
ones that take us back decades," said Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace
New Zealand climate campaigner. Marsden B would make it the first
major coal fired power station for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the massive climate impacts, Mighty River did not
assess the risk to the Ruakaka Conservation Area of coal dust and
fire from the coal conveyor belt and the Department of Conservation
(DoC) was wrong to give the project the go ahead without
understanding these vital issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By law, DoC cannot grant the use of conservation land if other
alternatives exist. Mighty River has stated that it has fall back
options, including putting the conveyor belt through private land.
This kind of industrial use of DoC land is completely inconsistent
with the purposes for which it is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DoC has gone even further by stitching up a secret deal with
Mighty River and the Whangarei District Council stating that it
would not oppose the re-zoning of the conservation land area if DOC
gave the green light for the coal-conveyor on conservation land.
The public has a right to know what is in this secret deal on
publicly owned conservation land and Greenpeace has asked for the
agreement to see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's ironic that at the same time as the international
scientific community are presenting dire warnings on climate change
the New Zealand Government is considering coal-fired power
generation. The IPCC report shows climate chaos is imminent. The
Marsden Bs of this world have no place in our global energy
future," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is urging governments of the world to heed the
warnings of an international body of scientists and take action to
protect the climate, while there is still time to avoid dangerous
or even catastrophic changes. The IPCC is currently meeting to
agree and conclude its fourth assessment of the scientific aspects
of the climate system and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate chaos is on the increase, and we all must act to cut
global emissions to avoid total climate meltdown," said Atkinson.
"New Zealand has an abundance of clean renewable energy available
like wind and solar. Using these, significantly increase energy
efficiency and conservation and phasing out polluting power sources
like coal would be getting us on the right track again," she
concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the public to have there say on New
Zealand's energy future by making a submission to the Governments
proposed energy strategy currently under consideration, submissions
close end of March.&lt;a href="/new-zealand/PageFiles/113287/coal-conveyer-submission.pdf"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;History of Marsden B&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2004 - Mighty River Power lodge application with
Northland Regional Council for resource consent to refire Marsden B
power station on coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2005 - Greenpeace occupies the roof of Marsden B for
nine days, bringing national attention to the issue. Jointly, with
local community groups, Greenpeace asks the Minister for the
Environment to "call in" the project, so that the government must
make a decision on the project. They refuse. The three activists
come down on the day submissions close. A record 4000 submissions
are received by the court, almost all opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July-August 2005 - Commissioners acting for the Northland
Regional Council hear submissions on the proposal. Greenpeace
brings experts from Australia and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2005 - Mighty River Power, a Government owned power
company, was granted a resource consent by the Northland Regional
Council to build New Zealand's first major coal-fired power station
for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2005 - Greenpeace and other community groups lodged an
appeal to the Environment Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2006 - Mighty River Power called for proceedings in the
overall appeal to be put on hold while it negotiated access to
Department of Conservation land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2006 - Mighty River Power submitted to the Environment
Court that climate change could not be considered in the overall
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 2006 - The Environment Court made its decision regarding
the relevance of climate change to the overall appeal, saying that
climate change is not a relevant consideration that needed to be
taken into account when approving Marsden B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 2006 - Greenpeace appealed the decision on climate change
to the High Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2006 - Department of Conservation (DOC) issue their
interim decision to allow MRP access to DOC land for a coal
conveyor for Marsden B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2006 -The High Court overturned the Environment Court
decision and said that climate change does need to be
considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2006 - Submissions closed to DOC regarding allowing
Mighty River access to DOC land for a coal conveyor belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2006 - Mighty River Power appealed the High Court
decision to the Court of Appeal. Genesis Energy indicated their
interest in joining the appeal on Mighty River's side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 2006 -Genesis Energy application to join appeal
rejected by the High Court. Genesis Energy applied to the Court of
Appeal to join the appeal, citing possible effects on their own
coal fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2007 - The Department of Conservation set its hearing
date for 30-31 January 2007, to hear submissions on Mighty River's
plans to put a dirty-great coal conveyor belt across conservation
land. Anyone who made a submission and asked to be heard, will have
the opportunity to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall appeal, including concerns about mercury, dioxin and
sulphur dioxide, remains on hold pending Mighty River Power's
application for access to DOC land. It is currently scheduled to
recommence in mid 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VVPR info:&lt;/b&gt; Suzette Jackson, Communications Officer, 021 614 899&lt;br&gt;

	One of our activists participating in a peaceful protest against a coal power plant outside Manila has been horrendously beaten by local plant security, who drew weapons and fired warning shots at people armed with nothing but a banner. Four other Greenpeace activists are also in hospital after having stones thrown at them.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;German volunteer Jens Loewe, 36, has been taken to a hospital
after being beaten with a metal pipe. Filipinos Janine Mercado,
Tomás Leonor, Pam Palma, and New Zealander Debra Gay Pristor have
also been taken to hospital after they were pelted with stones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the full story at activist Pam's blog with hourly updates
and audio from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is not the first violent reaction to a
peaceful Greenpeace protest in the Philippines. In 2002 during a
protest against the biggest coal-fired power station in the
Philippines a security guard fired a warning shot over the heads of
the activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace condemns this violent attack to a peaceful protest,"
said Greenpeace Southeast Asia Energy Campaigner Red Constantino.
"It is disproportionate to the nature of the protest which is a
peaceful, non violent protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're outraged that the Filipino plant personnel prefers to
protect the interests of a power plant that brings more harm than
good to people. Coal is the culprit here, not peaceful
protest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists were at the plant to draw attention to
Australian and Japanese backing of the expansion of climate
changing coal dependency in Asia. "The Masinloc power plant
displays the very worst excesses of the Philippine and Asian coal
industry," said Constantino at the plant site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal is one of the primary causes of global warming.
Australia and Japan are underwriting global warming at a time when
the Philippines and Asia are facing the likelihood of devastating
social and economic instability from climate change precisely when
the country and the rest of Asia are least able to deal with its
impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can climate change criminals pollute the planet with
impunity while peaceful protestors get beaten up and detained by
police?&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand is calling on the Fisheries Agency of Japan to recall the whaling fleet that has just left the port of Shimonoseki in Japan heading for the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace whales campaigner Pia Mancia said that the FAJ had
already declared that it intended doubling the take to more than
1000 whales this year - including the endangered fin and humpback
whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is an outrage that the FAJ thinks that it is okay to send
their ships thousands of miles into southern waters to hunt animals
that have already been hunted to the brink of extinction," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that commercial whaling had been banned by the
International Whaling Commission since 1984, yet every year since
1987 the FAJ had exploited a loophole in international law which
permitted it to issue licences for so-called scientific
whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Reputable scientists have condemned this 'scientific' research,
saying that the same information can be gathered without killing
the whales," she said. "The whales taken in these scientific culls
are cut up and sold in supermarkets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that one of the "scientific" objectives of the
FAJ's hunt this year was to study the role of whales in the
collapse of fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the vast majority of the whales they'll be hunting don't
even eat fish," she said. "Nine hundred and thirty-five of the 1035
whales they intend catching are Southern Ocean minke whales and
they eat krill."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims by the FAJ that "according to Japanese cultural
values…whales are viewed as a food source" do not stand up to
scrutiny, says Pia Mancia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In reality, few Japanese people view whale meat as a vital food
source, and even fewer actually eat it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"An opinion poll commissioned by the influential Japanese
newspaper Asahi in 2002 showed that only four per cent of the
population regularly ate whale meat. Nine per cent rarely ate it,
53 per cent hadn't eaten it since childhood, and 33 per cent said
that they never ate it."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Icelandic government's claims of sustainable whaling were harpooned today, after Greenpeace revealed that around 200 tonnes of meat and blubber from endangered fin whales are still in storage, waiting to be tested for chemical contamination and a further 179 tonnes of bones and entrails have been dumped in a landfill site.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information has come to light after an investigation by
Greenpeace campaigners in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Icelandic whale meat and blubber are intended for export to
Japan, despite whaler's claims that some of the generated product
is not fit for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling fleet is currently preparing to hunt 10
more fin whales and 935 minke whales in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary, despite having massive stockpiles of more than 4400
tonnes of unsold whale meat in freezers in Japan. At the end of
last year a single whaler, given a commercial license by the
Icelandic government killed seven fin whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Iceland claims their commercial whaling is sustainable, but how
can they justify it when they are hunting endangered species,
without domestic demand, and over-supply of whale products in
Japan?" said Greenpeace whales campaigner Jo McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Both Iceland and Japan continue to whale in the face of
domestic and international opposition, even though there is no
scientific, economic or environmental justification for it," she
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the Greenpeace ship Esperanza will sail to the
Southern Ocean, from Auckland, in order to put themselves between
the grenade-tipped harpoons and the whales, to stop individual
whales being killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a press conference on board the ship, at Princes
Wharf West, at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday. Speakers will be Junichi
Sato, Greenpeace Japan Whales campaigner and Karli Thomas,
expedition leader (and the only New Zealander on board).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exp. contact date:&lt;/b&gt; 2007-02-20 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today mourned the loss of one of New Zealand's great activists with the death of Green Party co-leader, Rod Donald.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Rod's unique and often flamboyant approach to campaigning has
been an inspiration to environmental and social justice activists
both here and abroad" said Greenpeace Aotearoa's Executive Director
Bunny McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One of Rod's wonderful legacies will be the way he skilfully
wove social justice and environmental issues together, recognising
the inextricable connection between people and planet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rod had the vision to not only highlight the problems facing the
planet but also provide solutions. This not only saw Rod fighting
to stave off the economic ravages of international free trade but
complemented this by campaigning for an independent and
economically strong Aotearoa with his Buy Kiwi Made initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Rod's passing we are saddened by the fall of mighty Kauri,
we can only be thankful that Rod's actions and campaigning over the
years have inspired so many New Zealanders to continue his
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts are with his partner and 3 daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

	David Lange put New Zealand on the international stage with his nuclear free legislation, making us the first country in the world to go nuclear free. As one of the country’s great leaders, he stood up to the might of nuclear weapons states like the USA, the UK and France and gave us the courage and independent thinking that is a part of New Zealand's identity today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Under David Lange, the New Zealand Government uncovered the
French's involvement in the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. He
pushed hard for New Zealand justice amidst huge international
pressure. The compensation he obtained from the French Government
after the Rainbow Warrior attack still funds peace and disarmament
groups across the country today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Lange once said the only thing worse than being attacked
by nuclear weapons is being defended by them. That disarmament is
still a live issue in the world is a testament to his foresight in
standing up to nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His vision of a nuclear free world has stood the test of time
over the last 20 years. it's enshrined in our nuclear free status.
Greenpeace looks forward to New Zealand continuing his legacy and
leading the world in the struggle for a nuclear free future.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><category></category><breadcrumb><value>Home</value><value>Press</value><value>Greenpeace launches Clean Energy Guide</value></breadcrumb><tag></tag><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/press/greenpeace-launches-clean-ener/</url><language>en</language><title>Greenpeace launches Clean Energy Guide</title><date>2005-11-01 00:00:00</date><text>
	Greenpeace today launched New Zealand's first 'Clean Energy Guide' that ranks electricity companies according to their current and future impact on the climate, on a simple thermometer-shaped fridge magnet.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Consumers have been in the dark for years about where their
electricity comes from. Now the Clean Energy Guide gives clear,
concise information for consumers to help them make the switch to
clean renewable energy and protect the climate. By switching you
send a strong message to energy companies that Kiwis do not want to
buy - or promote - dirty electricity," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace looked at how our providers currently generate
electricity, their future generation plans and their policies for
the future regarding renewable energy and fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each company was then ranked according to its impact on the
climate  - now and in the future. A greater emphasis was placed on
future plans and future policy commitments on energy sources. The
worst climate offenders are in the red at the top of the
thermometer - because of their contribution to global warming - and
the cleanest electricity providers are at the bottom in the green
(1). The ranking is based only on climate impacts and not on other
environmental issues, nor is it an endorsement of any company
(2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are at an energy crossroads in New Zealand. We have
important choices to make about which path we take: renewable,
sustainable energy to tackle climate change - or dirty, fossil
fuel-powered energy, which will heat up the planet.  As a result of
our investigations, we've found that New Zealand's number one
climate offender is Mercury Energy, owned by Mighty River Power,
followed swiftly by Genesis (Energy Online) and Contact (Empower),"
said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has a fantastic wind resource. Companies at the top
of the climate offenders list in the red, like Mercury Energy and
its parent Mighty River Power should be investing in clean,
renewable energy instead of dirty old, greenhouse-gas polluting
coal," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent independent poll conducted by TNS for Greenpeace in
October 2005, 70% of people surveyed would prefer to purchase
electricity that comes from clean, renewable generation sources
such as wind or hydro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some areas consumers may save money by making the clean
energy switch. In others it could cost as little as a cup of coffee
a month (3). 66% of people surveyed also said they would be willing
to pay more for clean, renewable electricity. Of these, almost
three quarters (74%) were prepared to pay an extra $11 or more per
month, while over 10% were prepared to pay an additional $90 or
more per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Electricity companies should take their customers' preference
for clean energy into account and stop investing in outdated, dirty
fossil fuels like coal and instead invest in renewable energy like
wind and solar," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace volunteers, together with local Whangarei residents,
launched the guide in Whangarei today - home to Marsden B - New
Zealand's first proposed coal fired power station in 25 years (4).
They ran a renewable powered "switching booth" in central Whangarei
mall where people could make the clean energy switch online. They
also erected Billboards along state highway one saying 'Marsden B
Gone, Switch off Mercury'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every household in the greater Whangarei district can expect a
copy of the 'Clean Energy Guide' to arrive in their letterbox over
the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Electricity companies were put into the following three
categories. The worst climate offenders are in the red at the top
of the thermometer and the cleanest electricity providers are at
the bottom in the green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Companies: Currently burn coal, oil or gas for electricity -
or plan to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercury (MRP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis &amp;amp; Energy Online&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact &amp;amp; Empower&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bay of Plenty Electricity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange Companies: Only use renewable energy sources for
electricity, but have no policy to only invest in renewable sources
in the future. (For the purposes of ranking "no policy to only
invest in renewable sources in the future" also includes companies
that have no stated policy on future generation options, or that
refused to answer the question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King Country Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trustpower&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Companies: Only use renewable energy sources for
electricity and have a policy to only invest in renewable sources
in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meridian Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are allocated scores on the basis of existing
generation and proposed generation and their policy on future
energy development. A stronger weighting is placed on planned
generation as these developments will determine our energy future.
A greater penalty has been given to coal as this produces the most
carbon dioxide of all the fossil fuels, therefore contributing the
most to climate change. Positive emphasis is also placed on
companies that have committed to only using renewable energy
sources in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) This ranking reflects the opinion of Greenpeace and is
intended to give Greenpeace supporters and the public an indication
of the relative impact of different electricity companies on the
climate according to their use, planned use and policy commitments
on different energy sources. The ranking assesses companies on
their relative impact on climate change only.  It does not assess
companies on other environmental issues, nor is it an endorsement
of any company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Based on an average Auckland household using prices from the
Ministry of Economic Development price schedule and Statistic New
Zealand's estimate of average yearly household usage at 8,000 kWh.
Note exact price differences may vary depending on location and
current supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Mighty River Power (who own Mercury Energy) is planning the
first major coal-fired power station in the country for over 25
years, at Marsden B near Whangarei. The proposal attracted a
nationwide outcry and a record number of submissions to the
Regional Council (over 3,000), of which over 95% were opposed.
Despite this, Mighty River Power was granted resource consents in
September 2005 to proceed with the station. In October 2005
Greenpeace lodged an appeal against this decision in the
Environment Court.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace report 'People Poisoned Daily' will be launched in Parliament today. The report brings together 30 years of painstaking research, activism and human suffering caused by the extensive use of Dow chemicals in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report reveals Dow agrosciences poisoned not only the people
of Paritutu but has left a legacy of chemical poisoning throughout
New Zealand. The chemicals 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D which together create
Agent Orange were sprayed so extensively on farmlands and
plantation forests throughout the country that their chemical
fingerprints are still found in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government needs to hold this corporate polluter
accountable," said Mere Takoko Greenpeace toxics campaigner. From
1949 Dow has doused New Zealand in over 20 million litres of
poisons. These chemicals were used until 1987 even though Dow knew
in 1965 that they were harmful to people." (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, successive governments have undertaken a number of
different studies in Paritutu. In almost all of these occasions,
key pieces of data have been omitted or studies have been done too
late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dow has poisoned our nation, the government needs to act now,
dont let these people wait another day, havent they waited long
enough?" Concluded Ms Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GREENPEACE DEMANDS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. That the Government acknowledge dioxin poisoning by
developing specialist health care centres and social services for
people poisoned by dioxins and that this process should occur in
cooperation and consultation with stakeholder communities,
organisations and Iwi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. That the Dow Chemical Company set up a national fund to
compensate workers, individuals and families poisoned by 245-T and
24-D and that it discontinue its distribution of 24-D and other
products which manufacture dioxins including its high temperature
waste incinerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) In 1965 Bionetics Research Laboratory in the US reported
that 245-T and possibly 24-D were teratogens or toxins that caused
congenital deformities. This report was suppressed until 1969.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 1965, a memo from Ivon Watkins Dows parent company, the Dow
Chemical Company, states in reference to dioxin: "This material is
exceptionally toxic. It has tremendous potential for producing
chloracne and systemic injury." That same year another Dow document
dated March 10, 1965 states: "This material presents a definite
hazard which would require all the precautions...to prevent
injury..." and "In my opinion their products should not be sold
until animal tests show these products to be free of a significant

            Greenpeace action against Japanese whaling in Southern Ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the expedition, which will be the eighth one to the
Southern Ocean, the campaign will focus on engaging with the 69% of
people in Japan who do not support whaling (1) in the Sanctuary, by
generating a global crew to campaign together through a new website
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/whales"&gt;www.greenpeace.org.nz/whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Last year our campaign forced corporations out of the whaling
business, now the Japanese government is spending tax payers money
on a redundant industry that the majority of the voters in my
country don't even agree with," said Junichi Sato, whale project
leader from Greenpeace Japan, speaking from Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want to work with the two-thirds majority at home who share
our view, so a clear message is sent from the people of Japan to
their own government to get out of whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition to whaling is often characterised by the Japanese
government as being anti-Japan, The Greenpeace campaign will send a
positive message that we love Japan, but not whaling, to make it
clear that while there is global opposition to whaling, there is
respect and understanding of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese government is not the only one that we will be
challenging to stop whaling," said Esperanza expedition leader and
New Zealander, Karli Thomas. "Too many governments have talked
about protecting the whales without taking action.  They need to
ensure that they gain enough support inside the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) (2) to begin the process of reforming it,
so it becomes an organisation that works for the whales and not for
the whalers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza is on the last leg of a global expedition -
"Defending Our Oceans", which exposed all the major threats to the
oceans and began in November 2005 by sailing to the Southern Ocean.
By putting themselves between the harpoon and the whales, activists
stopped 82 whales from being killed.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace increased pressure on the kiwi icon of fast food chicken today by releasing a poll showing that the majority of KFC customers would prefer to eat Non-GE fed chicken and would be prepared to pay more for it.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The poll was released after two weeks of legal threats by KFC
against news website Scoop for running Greenpeace banners linking
to a spoof KFC website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poll, commissioned by Greenpeace in support of their
campaign against GE soy, was conducted by research group Colmar
Brunton in early October. It showed that an overwhelming 80% of KFC
customers wouldn't mind paying an extra 2 cents for chicken fed on
Non-genetically engineered soy. Greenpeace financial analysis shows
that it only costs two cents more per chicken to use GE free soy
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When told of the potential environmental harms from growing GE
soy (1), 65% of all chicken eaters and 61% of KFC customers said
they would prefer to eat non-GE fed chicken. "Its a conclusive
result that puts paid to KFC assertions that their customers are
indifferent to GE in the food chain (2) and also shows that people
are willing to pay the tiny extra cost for GE free soy even if KFC
is not," says Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KFCs supplier Inghams, who have a history of feeding their
chickens on GE soy from the US, have recently imported non-GE soy
from Brazil but neither company is committed to this continuing.
Greenpeace opposes GE crops because of the environmental risks and
is campaigning for KFC to commit to using only non-GE fed
chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoop threatened&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within days of Greenpeace launching a spoof KFC website
(www.kfc.org.nz), KFC lawyers made threats against the Scoop news
site (www.scoop.co.nz) for posting a Greenpeace advertising banner
linking to the spoof KFC web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is telling that KFC's lawyers have written to Scoop three
times but haven't contacted Greenpeace directly at all," says Abel.
"Rather than get into a public debate with Greenpeace they choose
to try and shut down comment. Its a classic example of a SLAPP
(3)," says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spoof site contains alternative definitions of KFC submitted
by the public which KFC allege are defamatory. But Greenpeace says
the spoof KFC website represents a key form of humorous public
comment and honest criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"KFC are spending millions on re-branding themselves as 'Kiwi
For Chicken,' but when we suggest KFC means 'Kiwi For Cheapskates'
and invite other kiwis to voice a point of view they try to shut us
down," says Abel. "In a society that values free speech people
should be able to voice those opinions," says Abel. "It is very
concerning that KFC should wish to silence that critical comment
and we will defend to the hilt the right of the public to freely
express their views on corporations such as KFC."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has attracted hundreds of e-mails from the public and
generated over one thousand messages to KFC. Greenpeace will
continue to run its campaign across the country which includes
colourful and good humoured store protests by chicken suit clad
activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"KFC should really take heed of the poll results, listen to
their customers around the country and act for the good of the
environment by committing to non-GE fed chicken," says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) GE soy growing has led to more chemical use, lower yields,
new weed problems and contamination of conventional crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The Timaru Herald reported in August that KFC General
Manager Rod de Vries cited "300,000-plus customers" was evidence
that KFC's use of GE chicken was not creating public disquiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) are
a common corporate tactic for silencing criticism. The idea is that
simply the threat of potentially expensive legal action is enough
to shut-up public comment or protest. Very few such legal threats
ever make it to court but they often do succeed in silencing people
or under-resourced organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Deep sea life will not get the protection it needs from the United Nations, despite calls from thousands of scientists, millions of environmentalists and numerous countries attending todays United Nations General Assembly debate, say New Zealands leading environmental and conservation organisations (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, the worlds governments have missed the opportunity
to take one of the most significant steps to protect the rich life
of the oceans, by refusing to impose a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling. The resolution, due to be agreed by the General
Assembly later today, explicitly acknowledges the threat posed to
deep sea ecosystems by bottom trawling - but does not call for
collective or decisive action by the international community to
prevent further damage. It only calls on countries either
individually or through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations
(RFMOs) to take action and establishes a working group to "study
issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine
biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a review in two years time. The DSCC, through its
Greenpeace representative, was invited to address the UNGA on the
issue a huge acknowledgement of the work the coalition has done on
bottom trawling (2). The New Zealand Governments statement to the
Assembly today supported a strong call by Samoa (on behalf of the
Pacific Island States) for "necessary action" on bottom trawling in
the region. Ambassador Don McKay indicated that New Zealand wanted
to bring the issue back next year to address progress, emphasising
the need to look at areas where action wasn t sufficient. He also
reiterated New Zealands intention to start negotiating with
Australia on a RFMO for the Tasman. "It is heartening to see the
New Zealand government noting the urgency of this issue and moving
toward being able to reclaim its mantle as an international leader
on oceans management," said Cindy Baxter, Campaign Manager of
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However, an RFMO in the Tasman is a clear example of how the UN
resolution only singles out specific areas of the high seas for
protection, leaving the door open for a weak, piecemeal approach to
this global problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is something theyve been about for more than 10 years,
while the plunder has continued unheeded. RFMOs only account for
some of the high seas, not all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry Weeber of Forest &amp;amp; Bird said: "Overall, it is clear
that the interests of the few bottom trawling nations have won out
over science and common sense, We cannot afford to wait for two
years to review what we know is a practice which has to be stopped
now before its too late for high seas biodiversity." Cath Wallace
of ECO said: "Two years before a review is far too long for this
urgent issue the Government needs to take its action further. In
these next two years we are bound to see a bottom trawling frenzy
as the industry has now seen the writing on the wall."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Greenpeace, ECO and Forest &amp;amp; Bird are part of the New
Zealand chapter of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition - an
international alliance representing millions of people in countries
around the world, which is calling for a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Karen Sack from Greenpeace addressed the Assembly: "The
organisations on whose behalf this statement is being made, believe
that there is enough knowledge for states to take immediate action
to ensure a vibrant, sustainable and equitable future for all of
our oceans. Dont let short-term needs sacrifice long-term
viability," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Renewable energy, combined with efficiencies from the 'smart use' of energy, can deliver half of the world's energy needs by 2050, according to one of the most comprehensive plans for future sustainable energy provision, launched today. A report focusing on New Zealand energy needs and how they can be met will be released in February.

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            For the same investment, wind generates 5 times the jobs and 2.3 times the power as a nuclear reactor.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global report: 'Energy [R]evolution: A sustainable World
Energy Outlook', produced by the European Renewable Energy Council
(EREC) and Greenpeace International, provides a practical blueprint
for how to cut global CO2 emissions by almost 50% within the next
43 years, whilst providing a secure and affordable energy supply
and, critically, maintaining steady worldwide economic
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan states that renewable energies have the potential to
deliver nearly 70% of global electricity supply and 65% of global
heat supply by 2050 - not only in OECD countries, but also in
developing countries such as China, India and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Energy Revolution scenario comes as the world is crying out
for a roadmap for tackling the dilemma of how to provide the power
we all need, without fuelling climate change," said Sven Teske
energy expert of Greenpeace International. "We have shown that the
world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve
the efficiencies needed and we can do all this whilst enjoying
global economic growth and phasing out damaging and dangerous
sources such as coal and nuclear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind and solar markets are doubling in size every three years
and internationally are already worth US$ 38 billion, their growth
path follows the trends set by the internet and mobile phones.
Renewable energy can and will have to play a leading role in the
world's energy future. There is no technical but a political
barrier to make this shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Renewable energies are competitive, if governments phase-out
subsidies for fossil and nuclear fuels and introduce the
`polluter-pays principle`. We urge politicians to ban those
subsidies by 2010," said Teske.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the report also highlights the short time window for
making the key decisions in energy infrastructure. Within the next
decade, many of the existing power plants in the OECD countries
will come to the end of their technical lifetime and will need to
be replaced, whilst developing countries such as China, India and
Brazil are rapidly building up new energy infrastructure to service
their growing economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report was developed in conjunction with specialists from
the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace
Centre (DLR) and more than 30 scientists and engineers from
universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry around
the world. It provides the first comprehensive global energy
concept which gives a detailed analysis of how to restructure the
global energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand was involved in the modelling of this
report, specifically working on a roadmap for how New Zealand can
significantly reduce CO2 emissions over the next 50 years. The New
Zealand energy roadmap will be released in February prior to the
close of submissions on the Governments proposed energy
strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate chaos is on the increase, we all must act to cut global
emissions to avoid total climate meltdown," said Vanessa Atkinson,
Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner. "New Zealand, with an
abundance of clean renewable energy, has a responsibility to
increase investment into clean technologies like wind and solar,
significantly increase energy efficiency and conservation and phase
out polluting power sources like coal."&lt;/p&gt;

Exploitation of the large energy efficiency potential will reduce primary energy demand from the current 435,000 PJ/a (Peta Joules per year) to 422,000 PJ/a by 2050. Under the 'business as usual' scenario there would be an increase to 810,000 PJ/a, and a quadrupling of electricity costs. This dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for developing a significant share of renewable energy sources, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. The report was commissioned by Greenpeace and EREC from the Department of Systems Analysis and Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). &lt;br&gt;
2. The report develops a global sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential for renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all sectors of the renewable energy industry around the world, and forms the basis of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. &lt;br&gt;
3. The energy supply scenarios adopted in this report, which both extend beyond and enhance projections by the International Energy Agency, have been calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model. This has then been further developed by the Ecofys consultancy to take into account the future potential for energy efficiency measures. &lt;br&gt;
4. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a development pathway which transforms the present situation into a sustainable energy supply through the following mechanisms: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploitation of the large energy efficiency potential will reduce primary energy demand from the current 435,000 PJ/a (Peta Joules per year) to 422,000 PJ/a by 2050. Under the reference scenario there would be an increase to 810,000 PJ/a. This dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP) also improves the supply system's energy conversion efficiency, increasingly using natural gas and biomass. In the long term, decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources limits the further expansion of CHP.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy utilisation. By 2050, around 70% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources, including large hydro. An installed capacity of 7,100 GW will produce 21,400 Terawatt hours per year (TWh/a) of electricity in 2050.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will increase to 65% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Before biofuels can play a substantial role in the transport sector, the existing large efficiency potentials have to be exploited. In this study, biomass is primarily committed to stationary applications; the use of biofuels for transport is limited by the availability of sustainably grown biomass.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;By 2050, half of primary energy demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.&lt;/li&gt;

	Select reporting of the Treasury's statements on the carbon charge have distorted its recommendations by saying Treasury advocate that the charge be dropped, but the report actually supports a strengthening of the carbon charge.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Treasury has put up some of the soundest arguments for
strengthening the charge," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson.  "The most obvious being the publication of a
graph entitled 'New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions are rising
rapidly,' which is the situation under the current
zero-carbon-charge environment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However, one media outlet reported that Treasury recommend the
government 'Dump its plans for a carbon charge' - this is far from
accurate or balanced reading of the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury report clearly states that price-based measures,
like a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme would drive
structural change in the economy towards practices with low carbon
emissions. Far from a rejection of the carbon charge, the report
suggests strengthening it to apply "to as many greenhouse gas
emitters as possible and with few or no exemptions" (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the Treasury offered two strategic options. The first
strategic option was a relaxing of the policy but the second was
clearly a strengthening of the policy. The report states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The second option would be for the Government to accept that
more stringent climate change targets are inevitable in the long
term, and that sustainable policies should be established to allow
New Zealand to move towards these targets at least cost."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury report explicitly states that the carbon charge
tilts the playing field in favour of renewable energy generation
(2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the Finance Minister has stated that any proposed
income or company tax reductions could only occur if the carbon
charge went ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace strongly supports a stronger carbon charge as
suggested. Such a charge should be increased and applied to as many
as possible with no or few exceptions. It is worth noting that
emissions trading is not contradictory to the carbon charge,"
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Treasury report states that an optimum policy should
include consideration of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Increased reliance on price-based measures - either through
emissions trading or a reconfigured carbon tax, applying to as many
greenhouse emitters as possible, and with no or few exemptions. 
The effect of such price-based measures will be to bring about
structural change in the economy towards activities with lower
carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, it is likely that it will be most efficient
for New Zealand to adopt some form of emissions trading."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) All quotes used from the Treasury Briefing to the Incoming

	Parliament: The groups here today represent Dioxin Investigation Action Group, SWAP Sawmill Workers Against Poisons, Vietnam Vets. Te Waka Kai Ora and by proxy all peoples of Aotearoa/NZ.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This report shows that the entire country has been contaminated
by dioxin, from 245T and 24D (the constituents of agent orange) on
our land, our whenua and in our foodchain. No informed consent was
given by communities or the environment to be poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report contains evidence that this contamination is a
contributing factor to statistically high levels of a broad range
of diseases that are related to dioxins. This sits alongside our
knowledge of the impact of a range of other chemicals including as
PCP, DDT and PCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These chemicals are now universally banned due to their ability
to track through the food chain and accumulate in high levels in
those in the top of the food chain such as us and dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demand that the Government acknowledge the seriousness of
this issue and investigate and take appropriate action to help
those people affected and clean up the environment. This assessment
must be capable of answering the serious concerns and questions
that the community has about dioxins. This assessment must have the
trust of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical acceptance of these issues has now become mainstream,
as indicated by the Ministry of Health issuing a more rigorous
tolerable daily intake levels (TDI) for dioxin in 2002. Though even
this, is protecting the liability of a few rather than the health
of us all. Politicians have lagged behind in accepting the
implications of these modern scientific findings and addressing
issues .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The life of every New Zealander is too important for politicians
to hide behind limp excuses and lame denials. The first hurdle in
dealing with this is the recognize and acknowledge this has
occurred. This report makes denial of the issue impossible. We need
the Government to acknowledge the universal contamination of
Aoteaora/NZ by dioxins and take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statement made by Dioxin Investigation Action Group (DIAG),
Sawmill Workers Against Poisons (SWAP), Te Waka Kai Ora, Vietnam
Vets and Greenpeace Aotearoa/NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ends.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace ship MV Esperanza began an expedition to the North Atlantic from Killibegs, Ireland on the evening of Monday 11th October.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The expedition is part of a global campaign for a United Nations
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling - the most destructive
fishing practice on the high seas. From now until the United
Nations General Assembly meeting in November, Greenpeace will find
and expose high seas bottom trawl fleets across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High seas bottom trawling has been condemned by scientists for
destroying deep sea life before much has even been discovered and
named by science. 95% of bottom trawling fleets come from just 11
countries - with EU fleets responsible for 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand Timber Importers Association (NZTIA) won the right to expel The LumberBank - a member importing illegally logged timber from Papua New Guinea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The LumberBank, a subsidiary of Malaysian timber giant Rimbunan
Hijau, failed at the High Court to overturn the NZTIA's decision to
cancel their membership. The High Court ruled on Friday 10th to
uphold NZTIA's expulsion of The LumberBank and ordered The
LumberBank to pay costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a huge setback for Rimbunan Hijau's global reputation.
The NZTIA position is a ground-breaking stand for the forests and
the people of PNG. The message is loud and clear - the New Zealand
trade does not want illegal timber," said Greenpeace forests
campaigner Grant Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is extraordinary for a timber trade association to be forced
to expel one of its members. By taking The LumberBank head on, New
Zealand's TIA is leading the way for the trade and governments to
say no to forest criminals and their destruction of the world's
ancient forests," said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NZTIA, whom make up approximately 80% of the timber import
trade, has made a commitment via the NZ Imported Tropical Timber
Group Charter to only import from 'certified sustainably managed
sources'. Key timber retailers who have also signed onto the
Charter, the five of the largest New Zealand timber merchants
Placemakers, Carters, Mitre 10, Bunnings and the Independent Timber
Merchants - have said they will no longer buy timber from The
LumberBank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling gives a big boost to the market for 'good wood' such
as community produced 'Ecotimber' and Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC) certified wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace congratulates the NZTIA on their stand and for their
continued support of sustainable alternatives such as the ecotimber
suppliers in PNG and the Solomon Islands," said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is optimistic that 'ecoforestry' can flourish in
Papua New Guinea now that imports of illegal and destructively
logged timber have been damned by the New Zealand courts and the
NZTIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deafening silence from the New Zealand Government on this
issue is shocking especially after the Australian federal Minister
of Forestry and Conservation Ian MacDonald said last month that
they were going to ban timber imports from forests that are not
sustainably managed within the next six to 12 months", (1)
concluded Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaign activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February a Greenpeace report which exposed the corrupt and
destructive activities of the global Malaysian logging company,
Rimbunan Hijau, was published in the lead up to the summit for life
on earth--the UN meeting of the Convention for Biological Diversity
held in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also during February Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit together with
landowners from Papua New Guinea (PNG) closed Auckland timber
company - The LumberBank Ltd - accusing them of importing timber
from illegal operations in PNG and selling it here in NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace shut down the yard and hung a banner that read "Why
is illegal timber from PNG sold in NZ?". Visiting PNG landowner
representatives delivered a copy of the Greenpeace report, "The
Untouchables: Rimbunan Hijau's world of forest crime and political
patronage" and asked The LumberBank to verify the origin of the
timber in their yard which they refused to do. Three Greenpeace
activists were later arrested after police cut through chains that
were blockading the entrances of The LumberBank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Australia, Senator Macdonald spoke out on Australian
national radio on November 15th 2004: "I would hope we would be
able to work on this and get in place a proper regime which
prohibits imports from forests that are not sustainably managed
within the next 6-12 months."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I do think some of the most important forests in the world are
being destroyed through illegal logging and I do think we have to,
through the world community, stop the destruction of these very
special forests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

	DOW chemical company needs to be held accountable and accept full responsibility for the health effects it has caused to the Vietnam veterans and their children.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report released today by the health select committee shows
more evidence that DOW has created toxic disasters that not only
plague the New Zealand public but have occurred on a global
scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company responsible for the manufacturing of the chemical
Agent Orange, Dow Chemicals, has already paid out US$180 million to
Vietnam veterans in the USA. It is currently under litigation by
the Vietnamese who say that their land and people were so poisoned
by Agent Orange that supplying it to the military amounted to war
crimes by the chemical companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"DOW has caused irreversible damage by the use of the Agent
Orange. The recent Paritutu scandal shows that more and more toxic
disasters are coming to light in New Zealand. It's time the
companies responsible - and government - stop burying their heads
in the sand and sort the problems out," (1) said Greenpeace Toxics
Campaigner Mere Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomes an investigation into our current health
regime, which in its current state provides little acknowledgement
that chemicals such as Agent Orange are the cause of many severe
health effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's abhorrent that it's been over 30 years and still the
Vietnam Vets and the residents of Paritutu are waiting for the
Government and DOW to act. What's it going to take for these
polluting corporates to be held to account? The Government needs to
stop down playing these toxic disasters and sort them out - now -
not another 30 years down the track," said Ms Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Dow-manufactured chemicals 2,4,5 T and 2,4 D were used
as a chemical defoliant and hormonal spray throughout both Vietnam
and New Zealand. New Zealand was the last place in the world to
stop manufacturing 2,4,5-T - at the DOW plant in New Plymouth in
1987.&lt;/p&gt;

	Choosing renewable energy over fossil fuels as an energy source would increase New Zealand's security of energy supply, reduce reliance on fossil fuels like coal and help us meet our international objectives under the Kyoto Protocol, an energy expert told the Marsden B hearing in Whangarei today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ralph Sims, Professor of sustainable Energy and Director of the
Centre for Energy Research at Massey University, appeared at the
hearings giving evidence for Greenpeace in its submissions against
the building of Marsden B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Sims was a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, the coordinating lead author for the chapter on
energy supply for the IPCC's upcoming 4th assessment report. He
represents New Zealand on the International Energy Agency's
Renewable Energy working party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His evidence concluded Greenpeace's main submissions against the
proposed coal-fired power station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He outlined to the hearing the potential impacts of climate
change on New Zealand, warning of increasing insurance costs
associated with higher rainfall and floods, along with droughts and
the negative impacts on New Zealand's agricultural industry. He
said that New Zealand's current greenhouse gas emissions are more
than 22% above Kyoto targets and that Marsden B will add to these
emissions, and warned of the need to switch to renewable
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government Policy Statement on energy has three objectives:
security of supply, affordable prices and minimal environmental
impacts. The Marsden B proposal addresses the first two but not the
third as far as carbon is concerned. Renewable energy project
developers find it more difficult to compete with fossil fuel
projects where the external costs on the environment are excluded,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Sims told the hearing that Marsden B would tend to
make renewable energy sources less competitive because it does not
reflect the environmental costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Sims said that the Marsden B proposal illustrated the
cycle of large scale infrastructure building, where most
electricity users do not directly see or pay for the impact of
major developments on climate change or environmental damage,
leading to the building of more large scale developments. With
lower electricity prices, people and businesses have less incentive
to invest in energy efficiency improvements to reduce energy
costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that as the Kyoto Protocol is strengthened, the cost of
coal will increase with a rise in the cost of carbon. While the
proposed carbon charge is to be levied at $15 per tonne in 2007,
carbon is currently trading at over 22 Euros per tonne and
Professor Sim cited studies projecting costs of carbon of $NZ125/t
CO2 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today launched a new campaign demanding that the icon of fast food chicken, KFC, commit to GE free chicken feed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the first of a wave of planned protests, Greenpeace activists
clad in chicken suits gathered outside the KFC store in Otahuhu
with banners and a giant model 2 cent coin portraying the low cost
of feeding chickens on GE free soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite establishing a non-GE feed policy in 2001(1), KFC
switched their poultry supplier earlier this year to Inghams.
Inghams have been New Zealand's chief importer of genetically
engineered (GE) crops (2), and KFC is by far their biggest
customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to Inghams was reputedly taken in an attempt by KFC to
cut costs on their flagging fried chicken business. But Greenpeace
says KFC's reneging on their non-GE feed commitment is a bad
decision - given the environmental risks of GE crops and the
public's preference for non-GE fed chicken (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams have recently imported shipments of non-GE soy from
Brazil but have no commitment to continuing this, due to their
unwillingness to pay the premium for non-GE soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Any saving KFC think they are making on GE soy feed comes at
the expense of the environment," said GE campaigner Steve Abel. "In
the US and Argentina GE soy crops have lead to increased chemical
use, lower yields, contamination of normal crops and created a raft
of new weed problems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra cost of feeding one whole chicken on non-GE soy is
only around two cents (4). "For KFC, committing to GE-free would be
literally chicken feed," said Mr Abel. "We are directly asking KFC
customers if they mind paying the extra two cents for GE free feed
and inviting them to send a message to KFC telling them not to be
Kiwi For Cheapskates."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a demand from KFC for GE free, Inghams are likely to
return to importing heavily GE contaminated soy meal from the US
next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) "Restaurant Brands (KFC) intends to continue working in
partnership with its suppliers to eliminate, where economically
feasible, any remaining GM material from all ingredients and animal
feed by 1 December 2001" - Jim Collier, Restaurant Brands NZ Chief
Executive's Report, 1 February 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Inghams import around 50,000 tonnes of soy meal annually
predominantly for use as chicken feed. They have consistently
sourced GE contaminated soy from the US since the commercialisation
of GE crops in 1996. Inghams recently sourced their first shipments
of non-GE soy from Brazil but have no commitment to securing an
ongoing supply of non-GE soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Independent research done for Tegel found that 75% of
consumers wanted chickens that had not been fed GE soy meal, NZ
Herald, 29 August 2001. Tegel, New Zealand's largest poultry
company, have had an active non-GE feed policy since 2001 and were
KFC's supplier until July 2004. Tegel import certified non-GE feed
from the US and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has discovered illegal genetically engineered (GE) rice in Carrefour’s store in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in China. Greenpeace demands Carrefour to withdraw and stop selling rice from Hubei, and warns that other retailers are at risk if the Chinese government does not recall the illegal GE rice from the field and food chain.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer, is the latest
victim of the GE contamination nightmare. Since April, Greenpeace
China researchers have uncovered illegal GE rice being grown in
Hubei for more than three years, and it has contaminated the rice
market even in major cities like Guangzhou (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Carrefour must withdraw the contaminated rice to protect its
consumers," said Steven Ma, Greenpeace China campaigner. "We also
urge Carrefour and other retailers to stop selling Hubei rice until
illegal GE rice is recalled from the field and food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June Greenpeace researchers collected samples of rice from
Carrefour's three stores in Wuhan, and the samples tested positive
as GE rice in an independent laboratory in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"China has not authorised commercialisation of GE rice,
therefore any GE rice found in the market is illegal and has not
undergone sufficient safety assessment for environment and health.
Consumers are unknowingly buying untested GE rice from Carrefour,"
said Ma, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is likely to raise concerns that contamination may have
spread to other retailers and even international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns over GE rice are also rising in China. An opinion poll
released by Greenpeace in March, showed that 73% of Chinese
shoppers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, would choose non-GE
rice over GE rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government must take immediate actions. Such contamination
nightmare will continue unless the government recalls the illegal
GE rice," concluded Steven Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials promised an investigation into the scandal but
it appears that no action has been taken. Meanwhile, more GE rice
has been planted in Hubei and the harvest season will begin in late
August. Greenpeace estimates that up to 29 tons of GE rice seeds
have been sold in Hubei this year, and if no recall action is
taken, the seeds could produce up to 14,500 tons of GE rice when
harvested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) In April a Greenpeace research team discovered unapproved GE
rice being sold and grown illegally in Hubei province. An
international laboratory in Germany found 19 samples tested
positive as GE Bt rice - which is genetically engineered to produce
an inbuilt pesticide. In June, Greenpeace found unapproved GE rice
sold in the rice wholesale market in Guangzhou, raising fears that
contamination has spread out of Hubei.&lt;/p&gt;

	Mighty River Power’s proposal to convert Marsden B to a coal-fired power station would not be permitted in other countries such as the US, Japan, Germany and Sweden, a Greenpeace expert witness informed the Northland Regional Council’s hearing on the proposal today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace tabled evidence from a world-renowned environmental
scientist with over 35 years of experience in environmental
assessment of power plants and other facilities, Dr Phyllis Fox. 
Dr Fox's curriculum vitae stretches to 27 pages of work on coal
fired power plants and work on emissions.   She is listed in a
number of international "Who's Who" publications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Marsden evidence ignores many of the problems we have been
struggling for decades to solve retrospectively," she said, and
described a number of techniques that could have been, but have
not, been adopted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox described clouds of sulphuric acid, which impact
residents around coal-fired power plants, causing burning eyes,
headaches and sore throats, even when plants are equipped with
scrubbers, and told of one case in which an entire town in Ohio was
purchased by the operator following health problems from such
sulphuric acid emissions to avoid litigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Giving evidence for Greenpeace today was Dr Greg Miller, an
environmental scientist from Queensland, Australia, who has
practised environmental chemistry for 32 years. He said that the
cost of coal includes the release of greenhouse gas - 2 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and the social and
environmental costs on a regional and local scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Miller evaluated the true economic cost of coal power, and
said "If basic environmental and health-related costs are included
in the cost of electricity generation, then a clean technology such
as wind energy, would become more economically viable."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"This project had a low degree of sustainability in terms of
natural and physical resources and waste production, contaminant
discharges to air, water and land, and availability of renewable
energy resources in New Zealand," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another senior environmental consultant from Queensland, Shelley
Anderson, said that variations in the assumptions used by Mighty
River Power in predicting sulphur dioxide concentrations could
produce ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide that exceed
national standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shelley Anderson told the hearing that "carbon dioxide emissions
could cause acidification of the oceans which could affect marine
lifeh. Mercury and arsenic emissions from Marsden B could
concentrate in fish and shellfish affecting human health."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Duncan Currie, legal counsel to Greenpeace, said "Many adverse
environmental effects, particularly of the discharges to air,
water, and the effects of the carbon dioxide emissions on climate
change, meant that the proposal did not promote the sustainable
management of natural and physical resources under the Resource
Managment Act, so the consents should not be granted."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The application should be rejected as air pollution would
likely breach Air Quality Guidelines, it would allow mercury into
the food chain and the water pollution would significantly impact
marine life," concluded Mr Currie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"No company that is serious about long term sustainability in
environmental, economic or social terms could even consider
proposing a coal-fired power station in this age of climate change
and increased awareness about the effects of chemicals such as
mercury and dioxin on the environment," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also reacted to National's proposed changes to the
Resource Management Act.  Brash's proposal would mean people not
directed affected by a project would be unable to have a say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Marsden B is of national significance and will have global
impacts through climate change, but if Mr Brash were to be elected,
nobody outside Northland, and even no environmental groups, would
be allowed to make any submissions on the project," said
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Further if National removed the environmental legal fund, even
people directly affected by mercury, dioxins, sulphur dioxides and
other pollutants from Marsden B for the next 35 or more years,
would have to fight Mighty River and its huge legal and evidential
team completely on their own," said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand Government took the lead on driftnet fishing and should step forward and do the same with high seas bottom trawling, environmentalists said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand contingent of the Deep Sea Conservation
Coalition (DSCC) comprising ECO, WWF-New Zealand, Forest and Bird
and Greenpeace , placed an advertisement in Wellington newspapers
today (click here to download PDF) calling for the Labour
government to lead a UN moratorium on high seas bottom trawling -
just as it did in 1989 with driftnet fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groups placed the ads as their international counterparts
launched the DSCC in London and as UN discussions on ocean issues
continue this week. The DSCC says that resolutions tabled for
negotiation by the UN General Assembly fell a long way short of the
urgent protection needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cath Wallace, spokesperson of the Environment and Conservation
Organisations of New Zealand (ECO) said: "Scientific evidence shows
that bottom trawling on underwater mountains called seamounts
destroys more biodiversity and adds more threats of extinction to
more species than the driftnets - or Walls of Death - ever did.
Bottom trawling is as destructive of ancient sea-floor communities
as crushing a forest in order to catch the birds. In harvesting,
the habitat is destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Howe of WWF-New Zealand said: "There is a free-for-all
approach on high seas areas. A moratorium will allow time for
identification of areas that need permanent protection, provide an
opportunity for the UN to develop appropriate legal instruments and
allow fishers to find less destructive ways of fishing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry Weeber of Forest and Bird said: "Scientists have been
calling for urgent action to protect these deep sea treasures for
more than two years. It's time New Zealand stepped in and took a
lead over this important international environmental issue".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of countries have deep sea bottom trawl fleets
operating in international waters, the most prolific amongst these
being Spain, other European countries and Russia. New Zealand is
one of only 11 countries that took approximately 95% of the
reported high seas bottom trawl catch in 2001 and have been
promoting and exporting this technology around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace boat to expose bottom trawlers in Atlantic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace announced today in London that it will send its ship,
The Esperanza, out onto the international waters of the North
Atlantic to document the immediate threat posed by bottom
trawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Vanessa Atkinson will be on
board: "In June this year, the Rainbow Warrior found New Zealand
bottom trawlers on international waters of the Tasman Sea catching
small amounts of orange roughy along with large proportions of deep
sea creatures as 'bycatch' which were dumped overboard," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fragile and unique life of the deep sea around the world is
being devastated by bottom trawl nets. The deep sea is the biggest
pool of undiscovered life in the ocean, yet bottom trawling is
devastating these areas, driving species to extinction. A United
Nations moratorium on high seas bottom trawling is the only option
to ensure that these precious areas survive long enough to be
studied and protected for the long term," concluded Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DSCC represents millions of members around the world and is
supported in its concerns by members of both the scientific and
fishing communities.&lt;/p&gt;

	Alien-like species of the deep are being destroyed by EU bottom trawlers despite pledges to protect them. At a press conference in Dublin today dozens of mysterious creatures from the deep ocean, including green-eyed sharks, spider crabs and blob fish, needlessly destroyed by EU fleets bottom trawling on the high seas, were put on display on the Greenpeace ship, MV Esperanza.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the next 48 hours, negotiations at the United Nations over
the future of the high seas reach a critical phase. While earlier
this year the EU called for protection of deep sea life, they are
now reversing their position and actively blocking calls for the
moratorium (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Negotiations over a United Nations moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling have become a case of alien vs. predator. While the
high seas should be a resource for all, they are being destroyed by
a small number of nations who insist on carrying out the most
destructive fishing practice against deep sea life," said Vanessa
Atkinson, Greenpeace Campaigner onboard the MV Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High seas bottom trawling literally ploughs up the ocean floor
in search of fish and the fleets often target seamounts - the least
explored mountains on the planet, that rise more than a 1,000
metres from the ocean floor. Seamounts are teeming with deep-sea
life, some of which is undiscovered by science and much is unique
to individual seamounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria Jose Caballero, Greenpeace campaigner onboard the
"Esperanza", said: "The EU and all governments of the world must
support a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. The UN is
currently meeting to protect deep seas from this kind of
destruction and the EU is inexcusably blocking attempts to stop
bottom trawlers trashing important and unique habitats."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Esperanza" has spent the last three weeks spotlighting and
challenging bottom trawling in the North Atlantic. Seamounts in
this area run from the south of Iceland to the Azores and form the
world's largest mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a member of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition,
an international alliance of organizations, representing millions
of people in countries around the world, which is calling for a
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) In February 2004 during the Irish presidency, an EU proposal
at the Convention of Biological Diversity called upon the United
Nations General Assembly to take urgent short-, medium, and
long-term measures "to eliminate or avoid destructive practices
adversely impacting the marine biological diversity [of vulnerable
deep-sea areas]."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called for some sanity in the debate over New Zealand's potential Kyoto deficit, following the release of new report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers which calculated that it may cost $1.2 billion to meet our Kyoto obligations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is bordering on the ridiculous - the entire debate
following the revelation that New Zealand may not meet it's Kyoto
target has assumed that we will do nothing further to reduce our
greenhouse gas emissions," said Greenpeace climate campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But let's get real - New Zealand must reduce it's emissions
urgently to help avoid dangerous levels of climate change. If we
fail to do that, we will face the double whammy of having to buy
carbon credits as well as paying the costs of increased floods,
droughts and other climate change impacts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Debating how much carbon credits may cost us is like
rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. We need to be
discussing ways to tackle climate change - the biggest threat the
planet faces, by cutting our emissions. This means increasing
renewable energy generation, stopping climate-polluting projects
like Marsden B coal-fired power station, increasing energy
efficiency and improving public transport."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can't afford not to act on climate change. Global insurance
company Swiss Re has estimated that extreme weather events from
climate change will cost &amp;amp;#8356;150 billion every year from
2014. In New Zealand, the $400 million damage from the floods last
year and the devastating costs of droughts are just a taste of
things to come if we don't cut our emissions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Nick Smith's comments that political uncertainty around
the Protocol was worrying for business, he is clearly out of touch
with much of the business community. Members of the business
community around the world are pushing for more action on climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, business leaders from thirteen major UK
and international companies including HSBC, BP and Shell urged the
UK Prime Minister for "urgent action" on climate change, offered to
work in partnership with the Government to strengthen progress on
cutting emissions (1).&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today said it was alarmed to learn that the Department of Conservation has pulled back from its opposition to Marsden B after meetings were quietly held with Mighty River Power.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by the Director-General of Conservation
to the Northland Regional Council, DOC "is of the view that any
adverse affects on its conservation concerns appear to be minor,
subject to stringent resource conditions being imposed as
recommended in the staff reports."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director General had therefore decided not to address the
hearing in support of its submission, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOC had stated in its original submission that the power station
would impact on the recreational use of Bream Bay, may adversely
affect the habitat and biodiversity of affected areas, that
measures to control leaching of contaminants to groundwater are
inadequate, that Mighty River Power had failed to demonstrate that
the water discharges will not adversely affect the coastal water
and marine ecosystems, and that most of the proposal relies on
information that is not currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submission advocated a precautionary approach and stated
that Marsden B should not go ahead. Greenpeace said that DOC's
original concerns had been borne out by evidence during the month
long hearing, but DOC had not been there to hear it. It chose
instead to only listen to Mighty River Power in a private
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What is of grave concern is that DOC is simply taking Mighty
River Power at its word and has consequently withdrawn from the
process before taking other evidence into account. It's like
blindly accepting scientific arguments from tobacco companies that
cigarettes are good for you," says Greenpeace energy campaigner
David Fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By withdrawing from the process, DOC has abdicated its
responsibility to advocate for conservation, and has certainly
failed the community."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power had stated in the recent hearings that it did
not accept the low limits on mercury emissions recommended by the
Northland Regional Council. These were significant emissions which
would adversely affect the marine ecology of the area, and which
could pose a health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We find it incredible that has DOC declared it would not speak
to its submission rather than simply changing it. The department
has not taken Mighty River's objections to the proposed conditions
into account at all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expert evidence brought by Greenpeace to the hearing
included evidence by Dr Phyllis Fox, a coal expert from the USA
whose work spans 30 years, told the hearing that the building of
Marsden B would not be permitted today in countries like the US,
Japan or many others such as Germany or Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, Greg Miller of an independent environmental company in
Australia, said that the contamination of the marine food web by
mercury was likely to significantly increase levels of mercury in
certain fish species and consequently health risks to pregnant
women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Council staff themselves had concluded that the discharges would
be a very high point source for several potentially toxic metals
and dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All of the evidence before the hearing points to serious
contamination of the local area, and something DOC should be
concerned about," said Fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only remaining submission by central government is from the
Ministry of Economic Development, which supports the proposal. This
submission was specifically requested by the NRC (1) which argued
that DOC's opposition would be the only Government response to the
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has written to the Minister of Conservation
expressing its concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	This Sunday at the Saint James Theatre, Auckland will be transformed into an underwater world hosting bands, artists, DJ's and VJ's, all in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More than just a tribute concert, the event will be a sound and
visual experience that both commemorates a sunken warrior and
celebrates the achievements of Greenpeace over the past 20
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Artists from the Axis of Weevils will project images onto
two large screens inside the theatre throughout the night.  Jacqui
Brown will MC the event with DJs and VJ's keeping the crowd moving
through the changeovers.  Stilt and light walkers will move through
the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their only Auckland concert of this visit John Butler Trio
will headline the bill which includes Steriogram, The D4, Che Fu,
Don McGlashan and John Segovia, Opshop and Wellington band
Rhombus.  Don McGlashan is expected to be joined by special guests
on the night to perform the anniversary commemoration song 'Anchor
me'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the art direction of Allan Green, the St James Theatre
will be transformed into living art.  From the moment guests enter
the theatre's smoked glass doors, they will find themselves in
underwater vision.  Through a combination of theatre sets from the
Whale Rider, light, smoke and artistic genius, they will come face
to face with a replica of the original Rainbow Warrior as she can
be found now on the bottom of Matauri Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Multi Media event will also be a celebration of New
Zealand's nuclear free status.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sunday night is more than just a concert; it's a commemoration
and a real celebration of what we kiwis can be so proud of: being
nuclear free," said Campaign Manager Cindy Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	The Rainbow Warrior will depart from Auckland today to travel to Matauri Bay where the original Rainbow Warrior rests to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the bombing that claimed the life of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereria.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Warrior will be escorted out at 2pm from Waitemata Harbour
by a flotilla of boats including two Ports of Auckland tugs and the
Maritime Museum boat the Breeze. Following the bombing of the
Rainbow Warrior in 1985 Ralph Sewell's brigantine the Breeze led
the peace flotilla that sailed to Moruroa to protest against
nuclear testing in the pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple, inspiring and evocative ceremony will be held on the
morning of July 10 in Matauri Bay.  The current Rainbow Warrior
will sail into the Bay accompanied by boats and crew from the peace
flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew, former staff, current staff and invited dignitaries
will be in the bay, where a Maori ceremony (Powhiri), speeches and
prayers will take place in memorial of the bombing of the Rainbow
Warrior, which resulted in the killing of Greenpeace photographer
Fernando Pereira.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three divers will take a wreath (a marble sculpture of a dove
with the New Zealand version of an olive branch, made by sculptor
Louise Purvis) down to the wreck. The dive will be led by Peter
Willcox the skipper of the Rainbow Warrior on the night she was
bombed and back again this year to skipper the new Rainbow Warrior
for the seamounts campaign. This will be the first time that Peter
has dived the Rainbow Warrior since she was sunk at Matauri Bay in
December 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Rainbow Warrior is and always will be, a symbol of peace.
With the bombings in London last night, this weekend's
commemorations have even more resonance," said Cindy Baxter,
Campaign Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

continues to work for and symbolise.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the Greenpeace flagship the Rainbow Warrior, members of the original crew gathered in Matauri Bay, New Zealand, on the second Rainbow Warrior, to pay tribute to a colleague killed and a boat bombed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On July 10, 1985, two explosions on the Warrior rocked Waitemata
Harbour in Auckland, killing photographer Fernando Pereira. They
were planted by the French Government, in an attempt to stifle
Greenpeace's protests against the French nuclear testing programme
in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 years later, in Matauri Bay, original skipper Pete Willcox
dived down 25 metres to the wreck and placed a memorial sculpture
on the bridge, as around 100 people gathered on the boat cast
flowers and greenery on the water. The Rainbow Warrior, carrying
the banner message "NZ: proud to be nuclear free," was joined by
several other vessels in the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crew member and campaigner in 1985, Steve Sawyer, whose birthday
was being celebrated on the night of the bombing, urged world
leaders to stop wasting vast amounts of money and intelligence on
more sophisticated nuclear weapons and to instead engage in urgent
action to promote peace, combat climate change and preserve the
world's forests and oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today we are facing a bigger nuclear threat as an ever
increasing number of states continue their development of nuclear
weapons. No bomb will stop conflict - whether it be in the arsenals
of the nuclear weapons states, on the Rainbow Warrior, on buses and
tube stations in London nor on the streets of Baghdad."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We also face a global crisis as serious and devastating as any
nuclear threat: climate change. We only have a decade or two to
begin in earnest the transformation of our global energy system, or
heat waves, droughts, floods, rising sea-levels and widespread
famine and disease will overwhelm us just as surely as the mushroom
cloud," said Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace France disarmament campaigner Xavier Renou called on
his Government to get rid of its nuclear weapons. "France is
currently using the data gathered from nuclear tests in Moruroa
during the 80's and 90's to upgrade its nuclear weapons systems,
flying in the face of its international commitments to disarm.
Hypocrisy is the real driver of nuclear proliferation," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Abacca Anjan-Maddison of Rongelap Atoll - which was
contaminated by the US nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1953 - read
a message of solidarity from her Government, both for Greenpeace
and the Rainbow Warrior, and for the victims of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, 60 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last voyage of the Rainbow Warrior moved her people from
Rongelap. "Our Government honours the survivors and descendents of
the people of these two cities and we share the sorrow and loss of
the Rainbow Warrior after she transported our community to Majeto
in 1985," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand executive director Margaret Crozier noted
that 20 years later New Zealanders remained firm in their
commitment to being nuclear free - the first country in the world
to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand commemorations will be the first of many around
the world today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Paris, more than 500 activists from 14 countries will come
together to create a rainbow symbol of hope and peace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In Sydney, Greenpeace activists will hold a lantern ceremony at
Maroubra beach.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At 11.48 pm, at the time the first bomb went off, there will be
a two minute silence at the Rainbow Warrior Tribute Concert (2) in
Auckland, in Sydney and in Paris, where a bell will toll - in
remembrance of Fernando Pereira, the London victims of the bombings
on Friday, and for all victims of bombs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, will speak
at a Greenpeace reception in Auckland this evening (3), before the
concert.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Across the Pacific, church services are being held this
morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto and Vancouver, two of the three largest cities in
Canada, have just declared July 10, 2005 to be 'Rainbow Warrior
Day'. As Bruce Cox, Executive Director of Greenpeace Canada, said
on the occasion of the Toronto proclamation: "The City of Toronto
has a proud history of promoting world peace and rejecting nuclear
arms. In proclaiming today 'Rainbow Warrior Day', Mayor David
Miller and the people of Toronto honour the work that Greenpeace
continues to do around the globe and honour the life of Fernando
Pereira who died so tragically during the bombing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today condemned Brash and the National Party’s statement to the fishing industry, that they would drop the carbon tax.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Once again Brash has shown his ignorance of the threat that
climate change poses. Global warming is already impacting fisheries
and marine life as the oceans begin to warm and they become more
acidic due to increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other impacts on ocean ecology includes a change in
phytoplankton at the bottom of the food chain, affecting marine
mammals like whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When will Brash catch up with most of the rest of the world
that climate change is the biggest threat to the planet and our
economy? The carbon tax is a small but positive first step towards
reducing greenhouse pollution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that no less than 17 national academies of science,
including the USA, agree that climate change is happening, that
we're causing it, and that to combat it we must cut our emissions
of greenhouse gases, especial carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If Brash was really concerned about the long term
sustainability of our oceans and economy he'd be taking climate
change seriously and talking of increasing the carbon tax rather
than dropping it. Brash is irresponsibly political point-scoring
and is ignoring the real costs of climate change in New Zealand

	Derek Nicholls, New Zealand captain of the Greenpeace Flagship the Rainbow Warrior, has been arrested in Port Kembla near Sydney after blocking the entry of a shipment of genetically engineered soy meal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Then, less than five hours later, Greenpeace Australia's
activists were back on the job, branding the office tower of
Inghams national headquarters in western Sydney with the message
"YUK GM feed!" next to the company logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest is part of a global campaign that Greenpeace is
running against GE crops - most of which enter the food chain
unannounced as animal feed. "In both Australia and New Zealand
imported soy is the largest source of GE contamination in the food
chain and the biggest single importer and user of GE is Inghams
poultry company." Said GE campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 300,000 tonnes of GE soy sneaks into Australia each year.
"The poultry industry is the backbone of the trade in genetically
engineered soy in Australia and Ingham's are the largest single
user of GE," says Abel. "The same is true in New Zealand with
Inghams importing up to 50,000 tonnes of GE contaminated soy each
year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's biggest poultry company Tegel established a non-GE
soy feed policy in 2001 and continues to import up to 60,000 tonnes
of certified non-GE soy annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand has just begun a campaign for McDonalds,
who use Ingham chicken, to commit to a non-GE feed policy for all
their poultry and animal products. "McDonalds and Inghams should
stop using GE ingredients and feed out of a commitment to customer
preference (1), concerns about potential health impacts and for the
good of the environment," said Abel. "GE soy production in the US
and Argentina has led to increased chemical use, lower yields,
herbicide resistant weeds and contamination of conventional crops."
McDonalds already has a Europe wide policy of excluding GE in food
and poultry feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia's 'Elite Water Police' boarded the Rainbow Warrior
around 11pm, following today's actions against the Rhein and read
out charges to the boat master. The Kerikeri captain of the Rainbow
Warrior replied that he understood the charges but was unwilling to
move the boat from its current mooring adding that if the police
wanted the Warrior moved they would have to do it themselves. The
Warrior held her position in Port Kembla for eight hours. However a
tug dragged her from her position at 12.30am to a holding dock. She
has now been released and is sailing to Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainbow Warrior captain, Derek Nicholls, was charged with
failing to comply with a direction by the harbour master and
entering a pilotage port without taking on a pilot. He has been
bailed to appear in Port Kembla local court in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace trans-Tasman activities are part of a global
stepping-up of the international environmental group's campaign
against the spread of GE crops, which includes ongoing mobilisation
of consumers against GE food. Soy is the most widely grown GE crop.
Over 80% of GE crops are used for animal feed and nearly half the
world's soy is now genetically engineered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is clearly an urgent need to stop GE soy," said Steve
Abel. "At every opportunity, Greenpeace will confront GE soy, be it
along export routes or in the food chain. In Brazil, we are at the
forefront of the battle against GE soy, and in China we are working
to protect the homeland of soy from genetic contamination."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior, currently in Australia,
is due to arrive in New Zealand on May 12 for the New Zealand leg
of its GE Free trans-Tasman tour.&lt;/p&gt;

	In the lead-up to the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, Greenpeace said today that any attempt to undo our nuclear free legislation would see a massive backlash from New Zealanders.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Part of Greenpeace's commemorations for the Rainbow Warrior
Anniversary this weekend will be to celebrate that, 20 years on,
New Zealand is still nuclear free - and very, very proud of it. The
message we're getting from everybody at this time, both our
supporters and the public, is an overwhelming support for our
nuclear free legislation," said Cindy Baxter Greenpeace campaign
manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ball, she said, is currently in the US court. At the moment,
85% of US military vessels are not nuclear powered or armed and
would be able to come into New Zealand ports if the US dropped its
"neither confirm nor deny" policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We weren't intimidated by the French 20 years ago and we won't
be intimidated now - neither by threats from the US nor within New
Zealand. Our nuclear free policy is non-negotiable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace called on the US to show leadership, something that
New Zealand has done by being nuclear free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since our legislation, another 39 countries have become nuclear
free with New Zealand: something we can be proud of," said
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the US is doing the opposite, by kick-starting a
whole new round of development of smaller nuclear weapons. The US
Senate this week approved its new programme of "Bunker Busters" an
earth-penetrating nuclear warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is shocked with the Conservation Minister's approval today of a huge new coal mine at Pike River on the West Coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Labour Government's decision is completely inconsistent
with their commitments to doing something about climate change.
Coal burning emits more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel
and carbon dioxide is the major cause of climate change. This is
not just fiddling while Rome burns, its actively fuelling the
fires", said Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace climate campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Giving the go-ahead for the Pike River coal mine whilst Pacific
Islands like Kiribati begin to go under the sea and New Zealand is
battered with extreme weather events costing the country
multi-millions in clean-up makes no sense at all," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Pike River project will produce 650,000 to a 1.1 million
tonnes of coal which will produce 2.7 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide every year over the two decade life of the mine. This
decision and project is a throw back to the 1970s before we were
aware of climate change and the direct impact that such projects
have on our environment. Surely our government can move on from
1970's thinking!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One million species could become extinct due to climate change,
most by 2050, according to the scientific journal Nature in
January. "Climate change will cause mass extinctions and ecosystem
breakdown so it is as much as conservation issue as it is a broader
environmental issue. The Minister's decision to give the Pike coal
mine the green light is a further step in the wrong direction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Chris Carter as Minister for Conservation and as a participant
on the Ministerial Panel on Climate Change is perfectly placed to
ensure that economic development does not come at the cost of the
climatic systems that support us," continued Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are living in an age of climate change and its impacts must
be factored into all decisions that propose the mining and burning
of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Climate scientists have
calculated that we must leave 75% of all fossil fuels in the
ground, never to be burnt, to avoid dangerous levels of climate
change," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Last week eighteen year old Omanie 'Omax' Sakapeso came all the way to New Zealand from his home in the forests of Papua New Guinea. He came to join Greenpeace in exposing New Zealand's importation of illegally logged timber from forests in his homeland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Now, after taking part in a protest against Auckland timber
importer the LumberBank and meeting with Conservation Minister
Chris Carter in Wellington, Omax is in Kuala Lumpur to address
world leaders at the Convention for Biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the speech he gave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Omanie Sakapeso. I was born in Werio, a village in
the tropical forest of Papua New Guinea. I have four brothers and
two adopted sisters. My clan's name is Kuyele. I grew up in the
forest. My parents used to take me around in the forest when I was
a little boy. We were camping in different areas of the forest,
enjoying food from the forest, and then coming back to our village.
My parents taught me how to search for food according to the
traditional customs of my tribe. They also taught me how to
recognise medicinal plants. I learnt how to survive in the forest
and how to respect the spirits of the forest. For example, if a
woman carries a baby and there is a fallen tree lying on her way,
she has to go around the fallen lying tree instead of climbing over
it. This is a very important custom to protect the baby. We express
our respect for the spirits of the forests in many different ways.
Sometimes, we will cut a big leaf from a tree and spread some
breast milk on it. The leaf with milk is carried to a sacred
mountain or a sacred creek. My people ask the spirits of the forest
to give them food and water. They ask the spirits for help before
hunting. Small children fear the spirits and are not allowed to go
to sacred places without their parents. Today, foreign investors
have destroyed some of these sacred sites with no respect for the
indigenous people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life in the forest is so perfect, that I don't want to lose
it. My ancestors have been living in this forest for centuries,
relying only on the natural resources of the forest: fruits from
trees, sago for staple food, wallaby and cassoaries for meat, water
from the rivers and medical plants to relieve pain and cure
diseases. I want my children and grand-children to be able to live
in the forest if they want to. No foreign company has the right to
decide about how my people should live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father Sakapeso and my uncle John Danaye have always been
very active in fighting for their rights to live in the forest,
ever since the loggers came into their land. They initiated a
courtcase against Rimbunan Hijau (RH) nine years ago. But this
courtcase was delayed again and again and has never taken place. So
we called on Greenpeace to help raise public attention on the fate
of the paradise forest of Papua New Guinea. My people were very
interested to document the destruction of their environment and
made it possible for Greenpeace to enter the concession area and
witness the destruction done by the logging company RH. Greenpeace
has just released a report, telling the world about the destructive
logging practices of RH in my own forest. The government of my land
failed to protect my forest. I now put all my trust and hope into
the international delegates who are meeting this week at the Summit
for Life on Earth, the UN meeting of the Convention on
Biodiversity, in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only 18 years old, but I came all the way to Malaysia, on
behalf of my people, to see that the right decisions are made for
the future generation. Foreign investors have no right to destroy
our forest and impose another lifestyle on us. I came here because
I want to get rid of the destructive logging companies on my land.
This land belongs to me, to my clan and to the coming children of
my people. I have a right to take decisions for the future of my
own land. The politicians and the foreign investors have no right
to decide about my life and the life of my children. I want my
resources to be managed in a sustainable way, as the people in the
forest have done for many many years. My people take everything
they need to live from the forest, without destroying it. If the
loggers continue harvesting the forest as they do now, I will not
have any forest left to live in, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur, 10/02/2004 Omanie Sakapeso, 18&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace NZ welcomes Meridian Energy's announcement on Monday that it will not proceed with Project Aqua.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Stopping another destructive hydro scheme is a fantastic win
for the New Zealand environment," said climate campaigner, Vanessa
Atkinson. "But the Government should not jump out of the frying pan
and into the fire by promoting coal as the alternative. This
knee-jerk reaction only swaps one set of problems with another.
What we need is a considered renewable energy strategy for our
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal produces the most carbon dioxide of any fossil fuel when
burned which contributes to global warming, and needs to be phased
out as an energy source. It is impossible for a 'clean coal' fired
plant to prevent climate pollution," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National, NZ First and Act would have us believe that coal is a
good alternative - but it is totally irresponsible to promote coal.
The Government is still tallying up the bill for recent extreme
weather events in the Manawatu, Wellington and Picton - so far
pitched around $150 to $200 million. The costs of changing our
climate is blatantly obvious, and it is time we seriously
considered addressing climate change when looking at the energy
sector."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only last week, top New Zealand climate scientist Jim Salinger
said global warming means New Zealanders should get used to more
extreme weather events similar to last month's severe storms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol must be as strong as ever.
The proposed carbon tax is an essential dissuasion to curb lazy
decisions that maintain our dependence on dirty fossil fuels. The
impact of recent storms are a wake-up call that there are real
costs to burning coal and other fossil fuels," concluded Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace released 'Winds of Change' last year - a report on
the fantastic wind potential for New Zealand's electricity
generation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Foodstuffs, New Zealand's biggest retailer and producer of the Pam's private label brand of products, is allowing the owner operators of their New World stores to dispense the latest edition of the Greenpeace GE Free Food Guide.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Foodstuffs strengthened their private label GE free policy
position last year by committing to exclude GE ingredients and feed
from their Budget and Pam's products. Now much of the PAMs range is
listed for the first time in the non-GE 'green' section of the
popular GE Free Guide. This makes Foodstuffs the first of the two
major supermarket chains to achieve a 'green' rating for a
considerable portion of their private label brand range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Foodstuffs private label non-GE position is great and the New
World Owners should be commended for making the Guide available to
their customers. It has already proven a very popular information
tool for the public and I'm certain these wee guides will fly out
the door," said Greenpeace GE Campaigner Steve Abel. There have
been 100,000 copies of this latest credit-card sized fold out guide
published and this is the fifth edition of the Greenpeace Guide
since it's first publication in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foodstuffs executive responded positively last month to
Greenpeaces' suggestion that New World stores could dispense the
free guide. Already five New World stores have put their hand up,
including the Green Bay, Remuera and Victoria Park stores in
Auckland and the Whitianga and Taihape stores. The large Henderson
Pak 'n' Save is to offer GE Free Guides on 10 of their 16 counters.
The Body Shop and a number of organic shops throughout the country
will also carry the Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The steady shift away from the use of GE foods continues in
response to customer demand," says Abel. Since the previous edition
was produced in November last year both Arnotts (now green) and
Mainland Products (now orange) have moved from the red
categorisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainland's shift is very significant because it is based on a
new policy that their suppliers not use feeds containing GE crops
in dairy production (1). "Inghams are a major feed supplier to the
dairy industry so this is another blow to their continued use of GE
soy," said Abel. Greenpeace is currently running a campaign for
Inghams and McDonalds to stop sourcing GE soy feed and commit to a
non-GE policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guide is being launched today in time for the arrival of the
Rainbow Warrior to Auckland on 12 May. There will be open days on
the boat on the weekend of 15 and 16 May from 10am - 4pm.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and Papua New Guinea landowners today handed over a photo album graphically illustrating the plight of Papua New Guinea's forest peoples to New Zealand's Conservation Minister.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The album is a 'bon voyage' present to Minister Chris Carter as
he prepares to leave for the Convention on Biological Diversity
meeting in Malaysia next week," says PNG Landowner Representative
Dorothy Tekwie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We hope he takes time to read the stories of the people of
Wawoi Guavi, who oppose the logging by Malaysian company, Rimbunan
Hijau on their land, and get an understanding of the cultural and
ecological importance of the forest we are trying to protect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second photo album was delivered to the office of Prime
Minister Helen Clarke today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are asking the New Zealand Government for a gift in return -
to stop the importation of illegally logged wood, and strengthen
their commitment to the Convention on Biological Diversity so that
these practices are stopped not only in New Zealand but around the
world," said Tekwie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Greenpeace drew attention to the operations
of The LumberBank , asking the company to verify the origin of the
timber in their yard. The LumberBank is owned and supplied by
Rimbunan Hijau.&lt;/p&gt;

	"These GE onions are a stupid idea (1), shoddily proposed (2) for an experiment that won't even answer any important questions, it is both pointless and risky and ERMA will do themselves the final dishonour if they approve it," said Greenpeace GE Campaigner Steve Abel today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"GE onions pose economic, environmental and health risks, are
unwanted and are likely to lead to more herbicide use in
contradiction of their claimed purpose," said Abel on the second
day of oral hearings on Crop and Foods application to grow
genetically engineered onions resistant to Monsanto's Roundup
herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onion geneticist Elvira Dommisse (PhD) will today appear as an
expert witness for Greenpeace in support of their submission
(expected to be heard before midday) that the GE onion trial should
not be approved by ERMA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, during first day hearings, "key points were drawn out
that confirmed the pointlessness of the experiment," said Abel.
"The primary claimed benefit of these GE onions are that they will
reduce herbicide use and will therefore be more sustainable. Yet
the total elimination of synthetic chemicals is already being
achieved in organic onion production in New Zealand - which is
right now attracting huge premiums in export markets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that; the chemical cocktail that conventional onions
are subject to includes insecticide and fungicide sprays which
herbicide resistant GE onions won't even eliminate. "Cap this off
with the fact that the same GE onions are being developed in field
trials in the US already and you have to wonder why Colin Eady and
Crop and Food are even bothering," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If these GE onions represent the cream of Helen Clark's
'science innovation wave' - she'd better start investing more in
the arts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand public don't want GE onions, our three major
onion export markets don't want them (UK, Europe and Japan (3), and
yet Crop and Food want to throw ten more years of good taxpayers
money after bad, its stupid and pointless."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Herbicide resistant crops were designed by chemical
companies as a way of selling more herbicide not less - this is GE
biology 101. The idea that making a plant immune to herbicide will
somehow reduce herbicide use in the medium to long term is
ridiculous. The proof is in the pudding with roundup resistant
crops, such as soy and canola in the Americas, compounding weed
resistance problems and leading farmers to re-instate older more
toxic chemicals such as paraquat and 2,4-D to kill the roundup
resistant weeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) One scientist described the Crop and Food GE application as;
"The worst lot of pseudo-scientific rubbish I have ever read."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) UK (25.61%), Europe (48.87%) and Japan (5.45%) are New
Zealand's biggest export markets for onions with 80% of onion
exports going to these regions in 2002 (NZ Department of
Statistics). These are all markets renowned for their sensitivity
and aversion to GE foods.&lt;/p&gt;

	Just two weeks after the GE free commitment of food giant Goodman Fielder in New Zealand, Aussie biscuit giant Arnott's has made a strong ongoing commitment to sourcing non-GE crop derived ingredients and animal products raised with non-GE feed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The new policy statement, released yesterday, was prompted by
concern at the protest plans of a community action group the
Peoples Moratorium Enforcement Agency (PMEA). PMEA had planned to
begin a public campaign against Arnott's today due to their weak
policy statement earlier this year on the use of GE
ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomed the decision by Arnott's to publicly state
their non-GE policy and NZ GE campaigner Steve Abel acknowledged
the efforts of the PMEA saying it "shows the power of public
action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arnott's were classified in the green sections of both the
Greenpeace Australia and New Zealand GE free food guides until this
year when a poor policy statement led to a re-classification of
Arnott's in the red section of respective food guides. But in a
letter forwarded to Greenpeace, Arnott's made a re-doubled
commitment to sourcing non-GE ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We continue to audit all our suppliers to seek to ensure our
products contain ingredients derived from non-genetically modified
crops. And we have sought, and will continue to seek, assurances
from our suppliers of animal-derived products that they do not use
feed that contains genetically modified material." - Peter West,
General Manager, Arnott's Biscuits, 11-12-03&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arnott's will now move to the orange classification in the GE
Free Food Guide until clarity is sought as to whether Arnott's have
fully achieved a non-GE feed status for their ingredients derived

	Greenpeace is today concerned that the New Zealand Government has been co-opted by the fishing industry into a weak "case by case" approach to deal with the greatest threat to life in the deep sea: bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is despite calls by scientists that the only measure that
will ensure the protection of the deep sea - the biggest pool of
undiscovered marine life on the planet - is an immediate moratorium
on bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Minister of Fisheries has agreed that bottom trawling
causes "considerable damage" to the sea floor and the life it
supports," said Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Carmen Gravatt. "If
New Zealand is to really take a leadership role on this issue our
Government would be leading the way against the indiscriminate
destruction of bottom trawling as they have previously against
deadly driftnets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our Government seems to have swallowed the fishing industry's
self-satisfying ideas hook, line and sinker by stating that
regional agreements will save deep sea life. This is flawed because
it takes a long time to identify the individual bits of the high
seas to protect. It takes many more years to negotiate agreements
to look after those areas. In the meantime, during negotiations,
the plunder continues unhindered."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The unfortunate fact is we don't have the luxury of time. We
need an immediate global solution to the threat of bottom trawling
to deep sea life. The only real option is a UN moratorium in
international waters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups nationally and globally recognise our
oceans are in crisis from overfishing and destructive fishing
techniques. Each day extraordinary damage is being inflicted on the
unknown worlds of the deep sea by bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 1000 scientists from 69 countries, including New Zealand,
called for a United Nations moratorium in an urgent statement
earlier this year. Greenpeace and an international coalition of
environmental groups are supporting this call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawl nets are often weighted across the bottom with
heavy steel or rubber rollers that indiscriminately smash and crush
corals; they swallow everything in their path. It's like
clearfelling an entire forest in order to catch one species of
bird. These sensitive areas need a "time out" so we can work out
the best way to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A moratorium is temporary by definition. Once we know how to
look after the deep sea, fishing could possibly resume if it has
been proved to be sustainable for both the fish targeted and the
rest of the deep sea life," concluded Ms Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace applauds the NZ Governments decision to ratify the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety. The Biosafety Protocol is an historic achievement whereby, for the first time under international law, there is an explicit requirement that countries take precautionary measures to prevent GE organisms from causing harm to biodiversity and human health. Over 100 countries have already ratified the environmental Protocol and it came into force on September 11 2003.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A total of 1200 submissions were received by the Government
mostly in support of the protocol. At least 800 of these were made
via the Greenpeace website. Greenpeace also made a substantive
submission calling on the Government to ratify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a treaty that should be supported by all governments
that care about the protection of the global environment, food
security and the preservation of the worlds genetic resources from
the risks of GE organisms," said Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.
"Its very good news that the Government has chosen to ratify. Once
they do, it is crucial that New Zealand does not take a role in
undermining the protocol in the interests of corporate trade, but
is proactive in strengthening it and ensuring swift implementation
for the good of the worlds environment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand government has historically being part of the
Miami Group - a coalition of exporting nations that have sought to
weaken the Protocol. The Miami Group includes the US, Argentina and
Canada - the world's three biggest GE crop producers.&lt;/p&gt;

	A Greenpeace report exposing the corrupt and destructive activities of the global Malaysian logging company, Rimbunan Hijau, has been published in the lead up to the summit for life on earth--the UN meeting of the Convention for Biological Diversity held in Kuala Lumpur in February.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Rimbunan Hijau (RH) dominates the logging industry in Papua New
Guinea and has interests in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Malaysia,
Vanuatu, Indonesia, New Zealand and Russia, making it one of the
world's largest forest destroyers. Many of these operations are
characterised by documented illegalities and environmental
destruction. It is alleged that RH uses tactics such as political
corruption and abuses of local landowner rights within its
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auckland-based company The LumberBank New Zealand Ltd, owned by
Rimbunan Hijau subsidiary, Ernslaw One, is importing timber from
Rimbunan Hijau's illegal operations in Papua New Guinea. Greenpeace
believes a major part of the 4,600m3 of sawn timber imported into
New Zealand in 2003 is from illegal sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In Papua New Guinea, for example, RH is logging without
landowner consent, in logging concessions that have not been
initiated or allocated properly under the National Forestry Act,
and in contravention of environmental law," said Grant Rosoman of
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is concerned that New Zealand is importing illegal
and destructively logged timber from countries where logging is
undermining good governance and economic stability .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is essential that the New Zealand government moves quickly
to impose import restrictions on illegal wood, and takes a strong
position in international fora such as the Convention on Biological
Diversity and the International Tropical Timber Organisation." Said
Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

	Another of New Zealand’s biggest food companies; Goodman Fielder (1), has joined Australasian food heavyweights Heinz Watties and Unilever in the green (non-GE) section of the Greenpeace GE Free Food Guide. Volunteers dressed as Christmas elves will be on streets nationwide today handing out free copies of the updated pocket sized consumer guide to avoiding genetically engineered (GE) food.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Written statements from Goodman Fielder to Greenpeace outline a
new policy of excluding all GE crop derived ingredients, including
animal feed in their food production. "Goodman Fielder's non-GE
commitment is a great victory for the New Zealand consumer and it
comes just in time for Christmas shopping!" said Greenpeace GE
Campaigner Steve Abel today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodman Fielder brands now in the "green" section include all
their famous bread brands such as Vogels and Country Split, their
margarines including Sunrise and MeadowLea and Amco cooking oils.
Earnest Adams and Bluebird brands remain in the "orange" section as
the company is still in the process of ensuring the non-GE crop
derived status of all ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of Goodman Fielder's non-GE commitment follows
hard on the heels of a similar announcement last month by New
Zealand's largest supermarket chain Foodstuffs who have a strong
non-GE ingredient policy as do their major supermarket competitor
Progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tide against GE crop ingredients in food has carried a
steady stream of food companies from the red (may contain GE) to
the green section of the guide over the last four years. This is
set to continue as food companies increasingly recognise that
consumer opposition to eating GE is not going away."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Goodman Fielder commitment means all the major bread brands
and all the margarines in the supermarket are now 'in the green'
with Unilever (Goodman Fielder's major margarine competitor) and
George Weston (Goodman Fielder's major bread competitor) having
achieved a non-GE status over a year ago," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Christmas elves will be handing out free copies of the new
fourth edition of the guide at locations nationwide including -
Hawkes Bay, Christchurch, Auckland, Dunedin and Tauranga. The guide
can also be downloaded online at www.gefreefood.org.nz where a new
feature enables visitors to create their own shopping list from a
virtual supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Goodman Fielder is described as Australasia's largest food
company with a turnover in New Zealand of $662 million. Goodman
Fielder is the single biggest user and distributor of canola oil in
Australasia. The company's new non-GE commitment can be seen as a
significant blow to the market prospects of GE canola in
Australasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE Free Foods Guide Facts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· This is the fourth edition of the Greenpeace NZ GE Free Food
Guide. The guide has been updated and published annually since
2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· There have been over a quarter of a million (258,000) visits
to the online version of the GE Free Food Guide
(www.gefreefood.org.nz) since December 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· To date at least 100,000 published guides have been
distributed and 100,000 printed versions of this fourth edition
will be distributed over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Greenpeace Australia published their second guide this year
having distributed 500,000 copies of the first edition in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Greenpeace has published GE free food guides or "red and green
lists" all over the world including China, Canada, the UK, Germany,
Thailand and Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

	The claim made by Dow Agrosciences that the dioxin levels detected in Paritutu residents are not high enough to be harmful is plain wrong, Greenpeace said today. The company also has a history of avoiding liability across the globe, including at Bhopal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The report released yesterday by the Ministry of Health
confirms that the levels of dioxins in Paritutu residents are much
greater than the safe tolerable daily intake of dioxins identified
by the World Health Organisation," (1) said Greenpeace toxics
campaigner Mere Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Scientists internationally agree that there is no safe level of
dioxin. But the report confirms that the levels found in the
Paritutu community were way above WHO levels as well as the New
Zealand average. That Dow can say these levels are not harmful is
beyond belief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace points to a Cabinet Paper that was tabled to
government officials in 2001. The paper and accompanying reports
revealed that 1 in 1,000 New Zealanders are affected by
dioxin-related cancers. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The levels in the Ministry of Health report suggest that the
risk of Paritutu residents could be as high as 3 cancers in 100.
Statements made by Dow are contradictory to Cabinet Papers tabled
in 2001," said Mr Gordon Jackman, former Chair of Greenpeace New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Dioxins in New Zealand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a national health disaster that started in 1948, no other
chemical in this country has reached the levels of public exposure
and associated health risks as those revealed in the Ministry of
Health report. By virtue of this fact, New Zealanders could
possibly be the most dioxin-exposed nation in the First World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow-manufactured chemical 2,4,5 T was used as a chemical
defoliant and hormonal spray throughout the country. For example,
from the early 1970s, it was used to spray noxious weeds in forests
such as the Kaingaroa. It was sprayed by hand by Forest Service
workers on a daily basis. Forest workers like other groups exposed
to 2,4,5 T were unaware of the extreme risks associated with the
chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand was the last place in the world to stop
manufacturing 2,4,5-T - at the Dow plant in New Plymouth in
1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The disaster of Paritutu is a microcosm of what can only be
regarded as an act of chemical warfare against New Zealand and New
Zealanders. Today, we must all face up to the grim reality of a
past that contradicts our image of a clean and green nation," said
Mere Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow incinerator still polluting New Plymouth Greenpeace is also
concerned that Dow Agrosciences Ltd is still polluting New
Plymouth. The company was recently exempted from National Air
Standards released in June, and operates one of the last remaining
high-temperature hazardous waste incinerators, pouring dioxins over
the residents of Paritutu. The Taranaki Regional Council allows the
incinerator to pump out New Zealand's highest levels of airborne
dioxin releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Local residents should still be concerned of the high dioxin
emissions that are still being released by the plant's high
temperature waste incinerator," said Ms Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's Bhopal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from its statements that Dow is already running from
claims of liability, despite the clear evidence presented
yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has outlined below the history of Dow's avoidance of
liability worldwide, including compensating the victims of the
world's worst chemical disaster, Bhopal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the face of a national disaster that represents New
Zealand's own Bhopal, once again this company is refusing to accept
liability for the harms it has caused this country. If the
government is honest about accepting its role in this debacle, then
it should make this company pay up," said Ms Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow: denying liability worldwide Internationally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow is considered to be among the world's worst chemical
companies and has been known for its constant refusal to accept
liability for its crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what represents the world's worst industrial disaster, on 3
December 1984, over 20,000 people have died as a result of lethal
gases that leaked by a pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, now
owned by Dow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original company, Union Carbide, finally decided to pay a
woefully inadequate $470 million in compensation to the Indian
government for the victims to pay medical expenses for five years.
The people who were affected by the disaster now live in the shadow
of an ongoing environmental and health catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Union Carbide shed its name by merging with the
multinational Dow Chemical for US$9.3 billion. This made Dow the
largest chemical company in the world. Yet despite buying Union
Carbide's assets - and its liabilities - Dow has refused to accept
moral responsibility for the actions of Union Carbide in Bhopal, or
even to be accountable for the actions of the company it took over,
despite the fact that over 20,000 people in vicinity of the Union
Carbide factory continue to be exposed to toxic chemicals through
groundwater and soil contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow refuses to accept responsibility for the on-going health
problems in Bhopal. Nor has it attempted to deal with the large
stockpiles of dangerous poisons left behind or the toxic legacy
that is still ruining people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been working in Bhopal since 1999 when a team of
Greenpeace scientists worked with Bhopal community groups to
analyse the severity and extent of the contamination on and around
the derelict factory site. The study found substantial and, in some
locations, severe contamination of land and water supplies with
heavy metals and chlorinated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Assessment of the health risk of dioxins: re-evaluation of
the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) WHO Consultation May 25-29 1998,
Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation stressed that the upper range of the TDI of 4
pg TEQ/kg bw should be considered a maximal tolerable intake on a
provisional basis and that the ultimate goal is to reduce human
intake levels below 1 pg TEQ/kg bw/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also recommended that every effort should be
made to limit environmental releases of dioxin and related
compounds to the extent feasible in order to reduce their presence
in the food chains, thereby resulting in continued reductions in
human body burdens. In addition, immediate efforts should be made
to specifically target exposure reductions towards more highly
exposed sub-populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Evaluation of the toxicity of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs:
A health risk appraisal for the New Zealand population A report to
the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment February 2001&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifetime cancer risks vary from a range of about 10 in
10,000 to 15 in 10,000 based on the estimated time-weighted dietary
intake for a male New Zealander, to a range of 28 in 10,000 to 42
in 10,000 based on the ALDE estimate for the New Zealand
population.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace Jaguars leap into action: activists on motorbikes stop bulldozers from destroying forest lands in Salta, Argentina.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Cyberactivists around the world picked up the phone and called
the Argentine embassies in their countries to demand a moratorium
on forest destruction to stop the killing of rare wildlife and
displacement of forest peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaguar actions to save the forest included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 29th: During their latest prowl our jaguars tracked down
five more bulldozers clear cutting and burning the forest. Using
their motorbikes they intercepted the bulldozers and blocked their
path to the forest thus ending today's planned destruction. The
machines have been locked up with chains and 'Blocked by
Greenpeace' is now stamped on all the diggers. Monday's bulldozers
are also still locked up so, all in all, our prowlers have managed
to immobilize eight bulldozers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 28th: The Jaguars have now been at it for more than 72
hours - they have immobilized bulldozers, sparked press attention
in Argentina, and been supported by more than 5000 phone calls to
Argentine embassies the world over. The Argentine embassy in the UK
reported to one caller they'd had 14 calls in a half hour about the
issue: let's keep the pressure up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday July 26th: Nine Greenpeace activists, including five
'jaguars', located bulldozers in Salta, on the border of the Great
Chaco and Yungas forests. They climbed onto the machines and used
chains to lock them. Two days later, these bulldozers are still
immobilized, and other 'jaguars' are on the prowl for more.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace sounded the alarm over a pending agreement by the IWC on a process that could lead to the resumption of commercial whaling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Revised Management Scheme, RMS, put forward by Danish
chairman of the IWC, Henrik Fischer was developed in closed
meetings between Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden and the USA and if adopted could lead to the lifting of the
ban on commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outline in the proposal suggests that if the RMS is agreed,
there could be an automatic lifting of the moratorium with a 5 year
restriction to whaling in coastal waters followed by an expansion
to all waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unhappy compromise was reached to have the RMS ready for
consideration at the next IWC meeting. The RMS would still require
a 3/4 majority vote to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The idea that the moratorium on whaling could be automatically
lifted is absurd," said Greenpeace Campaigner Rebecca Hayden. "The
United States has already rejected this link. We call on Denmark,
Netherlands, Spain and Sweden to do the same."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace completely opposes any return to commercial whaling,
which has always depleted whale populations, and has never been
sustainable. The return to commercial whaling would be devastating
for the world's whale populations. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secret ballots, closed meetings and "vote buying" were the
buzzwords of the 56th IWC meeting. While the rest of the world is
aiming for increased transparency, the IWC is attempting to reduce
transparency, with the closed-door RMS process as a clear
example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruiting of votes by Japan from some of the poorest
countries in the world has turned into an annual activity at the
IWC with the aim of reaching enough votes to overthrow the ban on
commercial whaling. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The hundreds of millions of people who oppose whaling have the
right to know about plans for renewed whaling, not have them
secretively pushed through a backdoor," concluded Hayden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's campaign to oppose commercial whaling has been
underway for nearly thirty years and will continue until the threat
is over. The next meeting of the IWC will be in June 2005, in
Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The annual IWC meeting took place from 19th-22nd of July in
Sorrento, Italy. The IWC was established in 1946 in response to the
over catching of whales and it agreed to a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1982 because of its continuing failure to manage whales
without their populations declining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The pro whaling lobby in the IWC is lead by Japan. Since the
1990s they have used a tactic of buying votes to gain a majority to
overturn the ban on whaling. "We have been putting our efforts to
appeal to every potential nation at all levels and at all possible
venues," Japan's IWC Commissioner explained it to the Japanese
press last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's former vice minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, Hiraoki Kameya, said in June 1999 that it was "essential
to increase the number of nations supportive to Japan ... [and
therefore] necessary to couple effectively the ODA, Overseas
developing aid, and the promotion of IWC membership."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua's former Prime Minister Lester Bird said, "I make no
bones about it ... if we are able to support the Japanese and the
quid pro quo is that they are going to give us some assistance ...
that is part of why we do so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Greenpeace welcomed Prime Minister Helen Clark's comments yesterday that climate change is here to stay (1) and urges the Government to put its concerns into real action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister was commenting on the recent flooding
disaster in the Bay of Plenty which comes only five months after
devastating storms and flooding ravaged the lower North Island in
February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"February's storms cost New Zealand $300 million in repair bills
and the Bay of Plenty floods will cost in the order of tens of
millions. These are the real costs of climate change," said
Greenpeace Climate Campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Helen Clark is right. We are living in an age of climate
change. Now she needs to ensure that the Government takes urgent
steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIWA predicts New Zealand can expect more extreme weather events
like flooding and droughts, wetter conditions in the west, drier in
the east and warmer conditions overall, with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising temperatures are already causing glaciers to melt. New
Zealand's Franz Joseph glacier has retreated 1500 metres since
scientific observations began. Franz Joseph, Fox and other glaciers
are in an overall pattern of retreat. If temperatures rise by 1.5 -
4.5 degrees Celsius, the South Island could lose 1000 glaciers in a
few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But concerns about climate change are not just being raised in
New Zealand. The Prime Minister's comments come just one week after
David King, the British Government's chief scientific advisor,
stated that "climate change is the biggest problem that
civilisation has had to face in 5,000 years" (2). In January he
stated that climate change was a bigger threat than global
terrorism. Last year Europe suffered a crippling drought and
heatwave, taking 35,000 lives and costing 13 billion Euros
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is the main contributor globally to climate
change, mainly from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas for
our energy needs. Climate scientists have calculated that we must
leave 75% of all fossil fuels in the ground, never to be burnt, to
avoid dangerous levels of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we need in New Zealand is a long term sustainable energy
strategy that will allow the rapid uptake of renewable energy
generation like wind. What we don't need is more coal mines such as
Cypress and Pike River, or more coal and oil electricity generation
if New Zealand is going to get serious about tackling climate
change." concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Japan has lost its first vote at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Italy, despite buying off countries to support it, Greenpeace said this morning.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the first vote of the meeting, the Japanese Government's
proposal for secret ballots was rejected by 29 votes against and 24
votes in favour. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A vote against Japan's move to hide its vote-buying means the
IWC maintains transparency and lets the world know who the bought
nations are," said Rebecca Hayden of Greenpeace NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a difficult week lies ahead. The number of countries in
favour of whaling at the IWC is steadily increasing, not because
opponents of whaling world-wide have changed their minds, but
because new members are being recruited with promises of financial
aid. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some of the poorest developing countries in the world are being
used to vote in favour of whaling," said campaigner John Frizell,
of Greenpeace International in Italy. "This is a clear case of
'money talks' and it's happening right in front of us. It is time
we put a stop to this ongoing vote buying, before it is too late."
(3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuvalu, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania and Surinam joined the IWC
this year and all supported the secret ballot vote, and are
expected to vote for a resumption of whaling. The reason for their
interest is openly stated in the Japanese press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's IWC Commissioner explained it to the Japanese press last
month by saying: "We have been putting our efforts to appeal to
every potential nation at all levels and at all possible
venues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of these "appeals" is well documented: Japan's former
vice minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, Hiraoki
Kameya, said in June 1999 that it was "essential to increase the
number of nations supportive to Japan ... [and therefore] necessary
to couple effectively the Overseas Development Assistance and the
promotion of IWC membership."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua's former Prime Minister Lester Bird was even more direct
"I make no bones about it ... if we are able to support the
Japanese and the quid pro quo is that they are going to give us
some assistance ... that is part of why we do so."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The balance at the IWC is so close now that issues may turn on
a single vote" said Frizell. "It is appalling that a conservation
measure supported by hundreds of millions of people around the
world could be swept away by a well financed campaign of vote
buying by a government representing the interests of an outdated
industry."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Voting for secret ballots were: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize,
Benin, China, Dominica, Gabon, Grenada, Guinea, Iceland, Japan,
Korea, Mauritania, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Norway, Palau, Panama,
Russia, St. Kits and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Solomon
Islands, Surinam, Tuvalu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voting against were: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India,
Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Oman, Peru, Portugal, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, UK, USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The annual IWC meeting takes place from 19th-23rd of July in
Sorrento, Italy. The IWC was established in 1946 in response to the
over catching of whales and it agreed to a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1982 because of its continuing failure to manage whales
without their populations declining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The pro whaling lobby in the IWC is led by Japan. Since the
1990s they have used a tactic of buying votes to gain a majority to
overturn the ban on whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today said that despite the Government's commendable attempt to introduce "bottom line" regulations to manage the country's air quality, New Zealanders are still at risk to pollutants such as dioxin. Greenpeace is concerned that the new Air Quality Standards exempt industries that burn waste at high temperatures such as metal plants and cement kilns. It is also particularly concerned that it also exempts the nation's three existing hazardous waste incinerators.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"There is a clear need to set stricter standards to regulate
these key polluters," said Greenpeace toxics campaigner Mere
Takoko. "Hazardous waste incinerators foul our air, land and water.
They make it tougher for kids with asthma to breathe, fill our
lungs and bodies with toxic chemicals, and poison the food we
eat."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three incinerators in question are situated at Auckland and
Christchurch airports, and the Dow facility in New Plymouth.
Research shows emissions from these plants include dioxins, mercury
and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). New Zealand is expected to
ratify the Stockholm Convention which outlaws these pollutants and
obliges governments to eliminate their release into air, soil and
water media. Industries are also required to prevent their
formation in combustion processes by employing "best available
techniques" such as steam sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These pollutants are among the most toxic substances, and they
don't just go away when facilities pump them into the air.
Emissions settle on our waters, on our crops and on our gardens.
They persist in the environment and bio-accumulate in food chains,"
said Ms Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxin is a human carcinogen and at very low levels has been
linked to immune system and reproductive defects. Like other
unwanted chemicals dioxin has been traced to emissions from
facilities such as the US-owned Dow AgroSciences chemical plant at
Paritutu, New Plymouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The toxic incineration industry should not have exemptions to
poison the Paritutu community. Our environment has been polluted,
our quality of life worsened, our properties devalued and our
health compromised," said New Plymouth based researcher Andrew
Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the government acknowledges that dioxins cause serious
health problems. A Ministry for Environment report published in
1998 found that soil samples taken from a property neighbouring the
plant had the highest levels of dioxins recorded in New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The new standards add insult to injury in a community like
Paritutu where people have already suffered from historical
exposure to dioxins. Paritutu residents are not expendable, and the
Government and local councils now have national and international
obligations to curtail their toxic emissions," said Mr Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activists on their second day at their rooftop occupation camp on the Marsden B power station in Ruakaka. They are protesting against Mighty River Power's proposal to convert the plant into a coal fired powerstation that would pump up to 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. This would nearly double New Zealand's carbon dioxide emissions from coal.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            Greenpeace activist Raoni Hammer lowers himself to the ground before being arrested by police following a nine day occupation of the Marsden B powerstation at Ruakaka, Northland Thursday February 24. Hammer and 3 others climbed onto the roof of the main powerstation building to protest plans to re-commision the mothballed plant using coal as an enegy source. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After scaling the 50m high structure, the four activists dropped
a giant yellow banner reading "SAVE THE CLIMATE, STOP COAL" and
featuring the image of a burning Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their demand: that the Government stop Mighty River Power's
proposal to convert Marsden B from oil to a coal-fired power
station, because of the millions of tonnes of climate-changing
carbon dioxide that it will produce in its lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From atop the mothballed power station, activist Kate Lowe said,
"This would be the first coal-fired power station in New Zealand in
25 years - at a time when Kyoto has just come into force. Marsden B
is a dirty, polluting power project, a climate killer and will
leave a toxic legacy. If the Government is serious about Kyoto then
it should stop this project now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power has sought resource consent to discharge a
raft of persistent and toxic substances to air, water and land.
Marsden B would annually release up to 2.17 million tonnes of CO2.
The resulting climate and toxic pollution directly undermines New
Zealand's national and international commitments under the Kyoto
Protocol and the Stockholm Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Last year the Government removed the right of local councils to
fully assess climate change impacts when considering such projects.
This power station is of national significance because it would
establish coal as a legitimate energy source - which it is not.
This is why central government must step in and stop it," says
Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand urgently needs a sustainable energy strategy that
gives national direction to the way we generate electricity by
encouraging renewable technology such as wind farms, and stopping
polluting power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sources such as coal," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We must urgently act to stop catastrophic climate change and
that must begin with not building any more coal burning power
stations. If we make use of Kyoto correctly, today should herald
the age of renewable energy and the end of coal," concluded
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, an international group of scientists warned that we
have only ten years to avert catastrophic climate change by
reducing emissions - otherwise we may reach the point of no
return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a signatory to the formal 'call in' letter sent to

	Local residents, local Iwi, Greenpeace NZ and other national environmental groups opposed to the Marsden B coal power project have formally called on the Minister for the Environment, Ms Marian Hobbs, to "call-in" Mighty River Power's proposed recommission of the old power station near Whangarei as a coal burner.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a submission to the Government, the groups (1) say that the
application is of national significance and that allowing the new
320MW coal station would be counter to the government's own polices
and international obligations which commit New Zealand to reducing
climate pollutants and toxic emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might River Power have sought resource consent to discharge a
raft of persistent and toxic substances to air, water and land and
Marsden B would annually release up to 2 million tonnes of CO2 -
the worst greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This coal station is a bad idea on all fronts," said Laurence
Berry, spokesman for the residents. "It's bad for our health, bad
for the local environment and bad for the global environment too.
There is a strong and growing local opposition - the people are
outraged and the more they find out the more they don't want
Marsden B to go ahead," says Berry. "We have so much wind resource
in Northland - why don't we utilise it?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is also firmly opposed to the Marsden B which, if
built, would be New Zealand's first major coal-fired power station
in nearly 25 years. "Climate change is the number one threat to the
integrity of life on our planet and burning coal is one of the
biggest causes. With scientists warning that we may only have ten
years to stop catastrophic climate change Marsden B represents a
big step backwards," said Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.
"Climate change is a major issue of national significance, and
Mighty River's proposal for this reason alone should be called
in."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power's plans to burn 700-830,000 tonnes of coal
annually at the Marsden B power station has stirred strong
opposition from across the country. The call in request is also
supported by Forest and Bird, The Bream Head Restoration Trust and
ECO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core concerns outlined in Call in request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this matter has aroused widespread public concern,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;burning coal fuels global warming and climate change - Marsden
B will release to the atmosphere up to 2.17 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide per annum, meaning it will rival the Huntly power
station in its emission rates,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the application underlines the need for a national sustainable
energy generation strategy. Approval of the proposal will undermine
New Zealand moving towards renewable energy generation
projects,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;poisonous discharges and emissions of persistent and toxic
substances and heavy metals, including mercury, cadmium, arsenic,
sulphur dioxide and dioxins will contaminate the sea and
surrounding environments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the effects are relevant to the global environment and to New
Zealand's national and international obligations; namely greenhouse
gases and persistent organic pollutants (POPs);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;storage of ash waste close to the facility is not
environmentally secure. There are no considerations for removal of
the ash or proposed clean-up in the case of accidents,
discontinuation or closing of the plant,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Marsden B violates the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in
relation to pollution of air, land and water, including kai
moana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Chicken suit clad activists are to compete in a Christmas Games event outside New Zealand’s biggest fast food chicken company Restaurant Brands (KFC) in Penrose, Auckland today (1). Events will include the organic egg and spoon race and the three drumstick (or three legged) race.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Refereed by Santa Claus the Games are a demonstration of the
superior fitness of chickens fed on a GE free diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is staging the event as part of a campaign for KFC to
commit to a policy of only using chicken fed on a diet of non-GE
soy, a choice that would avoid the environmental harms caused by GE
soy growing (2). Gift packages of GE free chocolate, organic soy
beans and a two cent coin will be offered to Restaurant Brands
staff - who will be invited to watch the games. The two cent coin
demonstrates the nominal extra cost of feeding a whole chicken on
GE free soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit of fun for Christmas," said Greenpeace Campaigner
Steve Abel. "But the known environmental harms caused by GE soy
growing are a serious issue that KFC can have considerable power to
address in New Zealand. As the biggest NZ customer of Aussie
chicken company Inghams, a demand by KFC for non-GE fed chicken
would need to be heeded."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poll commissioned by Greenpeace on 15 November and conducted
by research group Colmar Brunton showed that the majority of KFC
customers would prefer to eat Non-GE fed chicken and an
overwhelming 80% of KFC customers wouldn't mind paying an extra 2
cents for chicken fed on Non-genetically engineered soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When told of the potential environmental harms from growing GE
soy, 65% of all chicken eaters and 61% of KFC customers said they
would prefer to eat non-GE fed chicken. "It's a conclusive result
that puts paid to KFC assertions that their customers are
indifferent to GE in the food chain and also shows that people are
willing to pay the tiny extra cost for GE free soy - even if KFC is
not," says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KFC's supplier Inghams, who have a history of feeding their
chickens on GE soy from the US, have recently imported non-GE soy
from Brazil but neither company is committed to this continuing.
The Games cap off a week of KFC store protests from Waihi on Sunday
to the opening of KFC's new Hamilton store yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

	An unprecedented coalition of 13 national organizations representing over 350,000 members have written to Prime Minister Helen Clark urging her to reject anti-environment changes to the Resource Management Act.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The 13 national environmental, recreational and community
organisations warned that proposals to introduce a national
interest clause and fast-track major projects were reminiscent of
Sir Robert Muldoon's National Development Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This kind of environmental coalition has not been seen since
the campaign that saved Lake Manapouri. Politicians should take
note. The public of New Zealand will not accept Think Big II,"
Forest and Bird's Conservation Manager Kevin Hackwell said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A recent Growth and Innovation Board Survey showed New
Zealanders don't want growth to compromise their quality of life or
the environment. This letter reflects the aspirations of New
Zealanders," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter to Helen Clark questioned whether there was any
evidence, other than anecdote, to justify the proposed changes. It
noted that the current boom in construction suggests that the RMA
is not slowing the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Ministry for the Environment, 49,000 resource
consent applications were made last year and fewer than 300 were
declined. In addition, research by the OECD shows that compliance
costs under the RMA are modest by international standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals singled out for criticism included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amending Part II (the purpose and principles of the RMA) to
include a reference to the "national [development] interest" and
adding social and/or economic objectives&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;reducing the scope of Environment Court appeals;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;introducing increased and unnecessary formality into Council
hearings;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;introducing costs at Council level and reinstating security for
costs at Environment Court level;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;limiting participation in resource consent processes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;substituting industry standards for environmental standards set
by plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizations proposed a range of suggestions for improving
the operation of the RMA including producing national standards and
national policy statements and providing resources to local
councils to better meet their responsibilities under the Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Resource Management Act has never had the chance to strut
its stuff. Major high-level sections of the Act have never been
implemented. After 13 years we only have one national policy and no
national environmental standards. That's a disgrace," said Fish and
Game's Director Bryce Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's no wonder regional councils have struggled to do their job
in a consistent and effective manner. No one routinely assesses
their performance against the purpose and principles of the
Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Reducing public participation in RMA processes would make it
much more difficult for people to protect their recreational
activities against impacts from unwanted developments," said
Federated Mountain Clubs President John Wilson. "The RMA is meant
to enable people to provide for their social and cultural wellbeing
and their health. That is what recreation is all about."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of the Earth New Zealand Co-director Bob Tait said that
if the amendments went through, then the long-standing and
nationally important role of watchdog groups would be stifled. "We
are deeply disturbed by these proposed changes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Taylor, Chairman of the Environmental Defence Society, a
group consisting mostly of resource management professionals, said
that he is especially concerned that any further weakening of the
RMA would "remove any remaining constraints on already rampant
coastal subdivision and development and destroy the qualities that
make New Zealand special."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Business and government need to accept that protecting our
environment is essential to our economic welfare. Our two biggest
income earners - tourism and agriculture - rely on our clean green
brand. Lowering our environmental standards would cut right into
our bottom-line performance as an exporting nation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations represented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fish and Game Council of New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Environment and Conservation Organisations of New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;National Council of Women of New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;

	Greenpeace calls on the New Zealand Government to take urgent action and introduce import restrictions on illegal timber after EU Environment Ministers took a firm stand this week.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government has failed to act on illegal timber
imports, even after Greenpeace exposed illegal timber imports from
Papua New Guinea earlier this year." Said Greenpeace forests
campaigner Grant Rosoman. "The Government should follow the EU's
call for acting "without delay" by adopting timber import
controls."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Environment Ministers have called for legislation to prevent
the trade in illegal timber. They requested that the European
Commission act "without delay", recalling their earlier demand to
review options for such a law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Illegal logging is a global catastrophe - it fuels civil wars,
undermines regional security, involves human rights abuses, causes
biodiversity loss, and contributes to deforestation and climate
change. It is totally unacceptable that New Zealand should continue
to be involved in the illegal timber trade," said Mr Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003 New Zealand imported over 10,000 m3 of tropical timber
worth $12 million along with $150 million worth of wooden
furniture. Two of the major source countries are PNG and Indonesia.
The Indonesian government has acknowledged that 80% of logging is
illegal. In PNG a World Bank/PNG Government forestry review team
found breaches to the forestry regulations by most logging
operations. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Labour made a commitment in its last two manifestos to cleaning
up timber imports, but the New Zealand Government has continually
failed to take action. It is particularly unfair for local forestry
as they are required to be legal and meet all the requirements of
the Forests Act," said Mr Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour Party 2002 manifesto states that "Labour will: Work
towards ensuring that only sustainably produced timber is imported
into New Zealand. To this end, we will continue to work with timber
importers and environmental groups."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand and the EU made commitments at the UN Convention of
Biodiversity in February 2004, to halt the loss of biodiversity by
2010. "Effective legislation and procurement policies are the only
way to stop the destruction caused by illegal logging." Concluded
Mr Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

	A report released by the Ministry of Health today has confirmed that Dow is one of the largest historical polluters in New Zealand, says Greenpeace. Dioxin levels detected in Paritutu residents are up to fivefold our nation-wide levels which are second only to South Vietnam.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is a damning indictment of 30 years of neglect," said
Greenpeace toxics campaigner Mere Takoko. "We will be supporting
the call made by the Paritutu Dioxins Investigation Network for an
independent inquiry into the environmental and health abuse of
Paritutu residents committed by Dow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also noted that the Ministry of Health's consultation
and delivery of a study on the blood serum levels of Paritutu was a
fiasco. The media knew about the visit by the Ministry to New
Plymouth before the people whose blood was tested. "We wonder who
the Government is more concerned about: New Zealanders or Dow?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ramifications of this issue spread far beyond Paritutu.
This company has affected many groups such as railway workers,
forestry workers and farmers," said Andrew Gibbs Researcher for the
Paritutu Dioxin Investigation Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what has been described by residents as the "second Vietnam,"
the company now faces undeniable charges of corporate crimes that
compare with the scale of the South Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dow's parent company has been linked to human rights and
environmental abuses throughout the world. They are currently under
litigation for the Bhopal disaster, - here 3000 people were killed
during the world's largest chemical spill. They are also under
litigation by the Vietnam Veterans in America and the Vietnamese,"
said Mere Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government is driven by its financial interest of
protecting its possible liability. Given that the Government was,
in 1969, subsidising 116 Dow products, it has reason to be
worried."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Tests results provided to Greenpeace by McDonalds this week confirm that Aussie poultry giant Inghams has successfully sourced non-genetically engineered soy meal from Brazil (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A ship discharged the feed meal at the Port of Tauranga in July.
"This is good news for the environment and for Inghams customers
who have been demanding that Inghams stop using GE feed in their
poultry production. However Inghams are refusing to commit to
continuing the import of non-GE soy," said Greenpeace GE campaigner
Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In fact we believe that Inghams are likely to return to a GE
contaminated soy supply from the US as soon as this December, which
is not good enough" said Abel. "Inghams are not willing to pay the
small premium for certified non-GE soy from the US, so Greenpeace
continues to call on the public to demand an ongoing non-GE
commitment from Inghams," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's biggest chicken company Tegel have sourced non-GE
soy meal from the US since 2001 and are also intending to import
non-GE soy from Brazil (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams first non-GE shipment followed a change in their policy
statement (3) and a statement by McDonalds New Zealand in May
requesting that Inghams seek non-GE feed for their chicken (4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But New Zealand's biggest chicken user, KFC, broke their 2001
commitment to sell non-GE fed chicken when they switched suppliers
from Tegel to Inghams in July this year (5). "KFC will be held
accountable to its customers over this broken commitment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in Australia two Greenpeace New Zealand activists, Vanessa
Atkinson and Anthony Downs, are appearing before a Melbourne court
over a protest against the cargo ship Despina in 2002. The Despina
was blockaded while carrying GE soy into the Port of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Based on and within the limit of the tests carried out the
soybean meal loaded into the vessels hold is 99.9% Non-GMO Purity -
SGS DO Brasil LTDA, Sao Paulo, June 07 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Independent research done for Tegel found that 75% of
consumers wanted chickens that had not been fed GE soy meal, NZ
Herald, 29 August 2001. Tegel, New Zealand's largest poultry
company, have had an active non-GE feed policy since 2001. Tegel
import certified non-GE feed from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Inghams Policy Statement: "We purchase non-GM soy when it is
available in good quality and at a competitive price. However, we
do not believe there are sufficient supplies of non-GM soy
available on world markets that are of suitable quality."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) "McDonalds is aware of concerns over the use of GM in animal
feed and has therefore requested its suppliers to identify sources
of non-GM soya in animal feed. This has been achieved by its
chicken suppliers." - McDonalds New Zealand, 19 May 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Restaurant Brands (KFC) stated in their 2001 Annual report
that "Restaurant Brands intends to continue working in partnership
with its suppliers to eliminate, where economically feasible, any
remaining GM material from its ingredients and animal feed by 1
December 2001."&lt;/p&gt;

	The charges against Rainbow Warrior captain, Derek Nicholls, were today dismissed by the magistrate due to Nicholls good character.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At a hearing at Port Kembla courthouse south of Sydney, 53 year
old Nicholls was dismissed of the charge of "failing to comply with
directions by a harbour master". On April 26, The Rainbow Warrior
blocked Port Kembla harbour, preventing cargo ship The Rhein from
exiting. The Rhein was bound for Melbourne, where it was to deliver
its cargo of genetically engineered soy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholls, of Kerikeri, NZ, said it would have been his first
conviction in almost ten years as skipper on Greenpeace vessels. In
a statement outside Port Kembla courthouse Nicholls said, "Our
blockade was successful in highlighting a very important issue. As
a father, I'm concerned about the impacts of genetically engineered
food on the health and safety of my children and of future
generations".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has discovered that as much as 300,000 tonnes of GE
soy enters the Australian food chain unlabelled each year, with
Inghams and other members of the poultry industry, prime traders in
the imported product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent market research commissioned by Greenpeace found that 61%
of consumers would be less likely to buy foods from animals fed
genetically modified feed, while 92% of consumers want these
products labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is about to set sail for Fiji, on a three
month tour promoting sustainable fishing in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace labelled Mighty River Powers sponsorship of todays "Balloons over the Waikato"(1) event as blatant greenwashing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Whilst Mighty River Power are happily promoting their renewable
energy developments and trying to win friends in Waikato
communities (2) they are pushing polluting coal power on other
communities, despite widespread public opposition," said Greenpeace
climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River Power are full of hot air. Their proposed Marsden
B coal fired power station in Northland clearly shows theyre all
talk and no action when it comes to sustainability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If they really wanted to show their commitment to New Zealand
communities they would develop only clean renewable energy like
wind and leave coal in the dark ages where it belongs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Mighty River Powers promotion of the event they held
a colouring competition with the first prize a tethered ride in a
hot air balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As part of our commitment to fight climate change by promoting
clean, renewable energy we have decided to launch our own
colouring-in competition to show Mighty River Power that New
Zealand doesnt want greenhouse gas polluting coal technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Colour it and you could stop it! colouring in
form will be advertised next week in the Northern Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entries close on April 29th with the prize winners drawn on the
2nd of May the same day the Greenpeace activists go to court in
Northland to face charges after their nine day occupation of
Marsden B in February this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two winners will win an exciting mystery Greenpeace prize
with runners up receiving Tshirts, posters and stickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on Mighty River Power to stop Marsden B in
favour of developing clean renewable energy sources such as wind
and for the Government to create a national sustainable energy
strategy to create a clean renewable energy future for New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) An international hot-air ballooning event held in the

&lt;p&gt;(2) In a Mighty River Power media release 1 April 2005, General
Manager External Affairs Neil Williams stated "Mighty River Power
has a strong commitment to the greater Waikato region with our
hydro and geothermal plants located here and we are delighted to be
able to bring the balloons to these communities."&lt;/p&gt;

	A ship carrying high level radioactive waste is expected to be going through the Tasman as early as this weekend, Greenpeace warned today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Sandpiper's lethal cargo consists of five casks
holding 124 canisters of deadly glassified nuclear waste. It
departed from Cherbourg, France, on February 17, and is expected to
travel through the Tasman between Australia and New Zealand as
early as this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This waste is the most radioactive material ever produced and,
if released into the environment, would be around for thousands of
years. The release of even a small fraction of this cargo from
either an accident or a deliberate attack could lead to an
environmental and public health catastrophe," said Cindy Baxter,
Greenpeace Campaign Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waste is a by-product from plutonium reprocessing at La
Hague, France, using Japanese irradiated nuclear fuel. It is being
transported through the Tasman by British Nuclear Fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry is touting nuclear power as the answer to
climate change, but the reality is that the safety, security, and
proliferation costs of high level waste are enormous compared with
clean, renewable energy such as wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear power is no solution to climate change. It swaps one
environmental nightmare for another. Nuclear power produces spent
fuel, which contains nuclear weapons usable plutonium and high
level radioactive waste such as this. Not only is it a huge risk to
the environment but it's also a security risk through such
shipments and from the plutonium it produces."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while financial costs for nuclear power continue to
increase, costs for renewable energy are falling rapidly. In the
last ten years, the cost per kilowatt hour of wind energy fell by
50% and solar from photovoltaics by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy is a total non-starter in New Zealand. Aside from
the unresolved issue of how to deal with the highly toxic waste it
produces, New Zealand has neither the huge and costly
infrastructure nor the skill-base to handle nuclear energy.
Moreover, the size of nuclear reactors would be too big for our
electricity system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has alerted the New Zealand Government and Pacific
Island countries to this shipment. Pacific Island countries have
repeatedly called for a stop to such shipments, yet no country
along the route has been told about the Pacific Sandpiper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Japan currently has a plutonium stockpile of more than
38,000kg of plutonium. As little as 5kg of this would be sufficient
for one nuclear weapon. Both Areva of France and British Nuclear
Fuels are trying to secure new plutonium fuel (MOX) contracts with
Japanese clients which would lead to many tens of plutonium
transports over the next 20 years, most likely to transit the
Tasman Sea and South Pacific. Greenpeace is campaigning for
comprehensive fissile material treaty that would prohibit all
production of weapons usable material - plutonium and highly
enriched uranium.&lt;/p&gt;

	150 joined a protest march against DOW including local residents, Vietnam Veterans, Sawmill Workers Against Poisons, Greenpeace and Paritutu Dioxin Investigation Network.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The march was led by Vietnam vets and residents holding a banner
which read 'DOW Poisoning People Daily'. People came from all areas
of the North Island to protest against DOWs refusal to set up a
nationwide fund to compensate workers, individuals and families
poisoned by 2,4,5-T and 24-D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The march finished at DOWs headquarters where speeches were
heard from local Vietnam Veterans then a moving ceremony was held
to commemorate the victims of dioxin poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Paritutu resident and World War II Veteran, Ray Kennedy,
was wheeled to the front gates. Followed by a convoy of other
residents, he laid a wreath in memory to people throughout New
Zealand whose lives have impacted and have lost loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The March highlights Dow's avoidance of liability and the
unwillingness of the Government to seek recompense as promised from
Dow. This leaves the emotional, physical and financial burden on
the people of Aotearoa," said Andrew Gibbs, Paritutu Dioxin
Investigation Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam veterans reinforced that Dow lied to the public by
concealing internal information that showed that as early as 1965,
Dow knew dioxin had tremendous potential to cause systemic
toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most people remain blissfully unaware of the 50's, 60's and
70's exposure to dangerous levels of Agent Orange type dioxins.
This exposure occurred due to food-chain contamination caused by
the widespread use of Agent Orange defoliants, 245-T and 24-D."
Concluded Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;

	www.Yes2Wind.co.nz , a website to support and promote the use of wind power in New Zealand has been launched by Greenpeace, and endorsed and supported by national environmental groups: the Environment and Conservation Organisation of New Zealand (ECO), the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society and WWF New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmentalists say the technology can boost jobs and
tourism while fighting climate change - the world's biggest
environmental problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are many concerns and worries about wind power. This
website is designed to answer those questions and give the many New
Zealanders who want to support a windfarm the information they need
to do so," said Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace Campaign Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A EECA poll in July 2004 showed 82% of New Zealand respondents
approved or strongly approved of wind power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is based on a very successful site run by a similar
group of environmentalists in the UK ( http://www.yes2wind.com ),
where the wind energy industry is growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website has detailed information for how people can support
local windfarm applications and gives practical advice on how
people can get more involved in promoting windfarms in their
area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides detailed answers to some of the myths around wind
technology. One example is around the noise made by wind turbines.
In Scotland, a MORI poll showed that 12% of people objected to a
wind farm near their homes before the windfarm was built. However,
after they were built, that figure shrank to just 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new website has a map showing areas where current windfarms
are and also where new sites are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes2wind outlines how windfarms must be a key part of New
Zealand's efforts to tackle climate change, and can increase
investment, create jobs and attract tourists, as well as reducing
air pollution. This technology has the potential to greatly reduce
New Zealand's dependence on fossil fuels like coal and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand can meet its current energy needs with wind three
times over. It's time we turned our back on polluting power and
embrace clean, renewable energy sources. We urge anyone who wants
to get involved in fighting for our environment to say 'Yes' to
wind," said Cindy Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

	Sawmill workers from Whakatane met with four Government Ministers today to demand Government action on their health issues associated with PCP poisoning.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Sawmill Workers Against Poisons 'SWAP' organisation brought
40 dioxin-poisoned people with them from the Bay of Plenty.  These
people have a range of severe illnesses as a result of their
exposure to PCP in the Whakatane sawmill. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives attended a closed door meeting with Associate
Minister of Health Pete Hodgson, Minister for ACC Ruth Dyson,
Minister for the Environment Marian Hobbs and Minster of Maori
Affairs Parekura Horomia, to call for progress on their ACC and
general health issues, as well as for a requirement to clean up
contaminated sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their meeting took place at the end of the "People Poisoned
Daily" tour, organised by Greenpeace, which has seen meetings
around the North Island in the last week to address health issues
from New Zealand's historic use of highly toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A historical event took place today, the Government has
recognised the relationship between the chemicals that we used and
our ill health," said Joe Harawira, Chairman of SWAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is willing to continue dialogue with the sawmill
workers because they recognise that there is a problem, but there
are legal barriers to changing the current ACC Act, which in its
present state doesn't recognise historic claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Their excuse was 'this is the law and we can't do anything
about it'.  There is the law and there are the lawmakers.  Let us
not allow our law makers to hide behind the law.  This is a
deliberate process to stop the timber workers from getting
justice," said Rachel Dargaville, spouse of a former sawmill
worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group is also asking the Government to set up specialised
clinics to properly care for people suffering from chemical related
illnesses and to put resources into educating both the public and
medical practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On health matters, they're still hiding behind the old lies the
tobacco companies used which required every victim to prove exactly
how they were poisoned, when the proof of safety should be on the
polluters," said independent scientist Gordon Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The doctors won't recognise the symptoms. I have had life
threatening experiences; respiratory problems, skin problems,
headaches. The bloody illness totally demobilised me," said
Harawira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"From an environmental point of view, we have an indication that
the Government is moving very slowly to develop new clean up
standards for contaminated sites.  This may be too late for many
sites and many people, and we have no confidence that even new
standards will help the land and the people." Concluded
Harawira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today more residents of Paritutu received the results of their
blood tests, showing the levels of dioxins in their blood to be
much higher than the New Zealand average.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Just like the Paritutu residents and the Vietnam Veterans,
anyone who has been exposed to these chemicals, either in the
workplace or through living close to industrial sites should have a
right to free and adequate health care for themselves, their
families and future generations. These highly persistent, highly
toxic chemicals leave a deadly legacy in our bodies, in our genes
and in the lands and waterways," said Greenpeace campaigner Mere
Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also taking part in the People Poisoned Daily Tour were Vietnam
veterans, Greenpeace and Paritutu Dioxin Investigation Group.
Greenpeace's Mere Takoko attended the meeting with the Ministers
and tabled the Hohou Te Rongo (People Poisoned Daily) Declaration
on behalf of the various groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) From the 1950s through to the late 1980s pentachlorophenol
(PCP) was widely used in the New Zealand timber industry, and
almost all freshly sawn timber treated to prevent sapstain fungi
that grows on the timber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Conservation estimates almost 600 sites in New
Zealand are contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organic chemical can be released into the atmosphere from
treated wood and transported to surface water and soils. It is also
released into the atmosphere from factory waste disposal, entering
the soil as a result of spills, disposal at hazardous waste sites
and its use as a pesticide. The compound can be present in fish or
other food species and its levels are monitored by the USA Food and
Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are exposed to PCPs through contaminated drinking water,
the inhalation of contaminated air and through the handling of
treated timber, textiles, leather and paper products. PCP is
completely and rapidly absorbed by the digestive tract where it
enters the bloodstream, and accumulates in highest concentrations
in the liver, kidneys and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	It is extremely concerning that the Government does not consider a near-doubling of our C02 emissions from coal-fired power stations an issue of national significance. However, we will stand alongside the public and fight Mighty River Power all the way to ensure that Marsden B doesn´t happen.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thermal generation is the single biggest cause of an increase in
New Zealand C02 emissions in the last year. Huntly has increased
its C02 emissions by over 400% since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is currently at 22% above our 1990 levels of C02
emissions. How on earth does the Government think we're going to
meet our Kyoto commitments and get to zero by 2012 if it takes no
action to stop projects like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also of concern that the Government is using its proposed
carbon tax as an excuse to allow a power plant to emit millions of
tonnes of carbon dioxide. If a State Owned Enterprise can simply
pay the carbon charge and still go ahead with the country´s first
coal-fired power station in 25 years, this raises major concerns
over the effectiveness of the tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we support the carbon tax, it was not designed to be used
in this way. It was designed to reduce our emissions, not increase
them. The wind industry says that wind could be producing 1000 MW
of electricity by 2010. But the Government´s short-term, crisis
management of our electricity supply means that it looks to big,
dirty power projects like Marsden B as a resolution, putting clean
energy projects like wind on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this age of the certainty of climate change, the Government
must take this matter in hand and define a national sustainable
energy strategy which places wind and other renewable energy
projects at the forefront of our energy solutions - and says no to
coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also an insult to the communities of Whangarei and
Northland that the Government doesn't consider further increases in
sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and dioxins a
matter of national significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our climbers are still on the roof of Marsden B. We will be
discussing this latest development with the three activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statement from Steve Abel, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today the Hohou te Rongo - People Poisoned Daily Speaking Tour will be holding the first of five public meetings to address the issue of communities impacted by toxic chemicals.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, together with the Sawmill Workers Against Poisons
(SWAP), Vietnam Veterans of Aotearoa, Paritutu Dioxin Investigation
Action Group and Te Waka Kai Ora (Maori organics group) have
organised the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whakatane is one of many communities that have felt first hand
the impacts from industries dumping of toxic chemicals," said Joe
Harawira, chairman of SWAP. "From the use of dioxin-laced
Pentachlorophenol (PCP) during the timber treatment process, (1) to
the issues of poisoning of our waterways and dumping of
contaminated soil into various sites around both Whakatane and New
Zealand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour's focus will be on dioxin poisoning. Urgent action is
needed to stop the dumping of lethal toxic waste, produced daily by
industries throughout the country. Dioxins are banned by
international laws, but industries are still pumping them into our
air, water and soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tonight is an opportunity for the local community to hear first
hand stories from different groups whose lives have been affected
by poisons and what both the Government and industry should be
doing to address these serious issues," said Harawira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groups will then workshop with local residents about the
issues that affect them and discuss solutions at both a regional
and a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For too long successive governments have allowed the rights of
companies to supersede our rights to a clean and healthy
environment.  It's time for the current Government to stand up and
make these companies accountable for the lives they have destroyed
through the use of their toxic chemicals," said Mere Takoko,
Greenpeace toxics campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many groups involved with tour will sign onto the Hohou te
Rongo declaration which will then be tabled to key MPs in
Wellington on the 10th March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Sawmiller and timber workers were exposed to very risky
levels of dioxin contaminated Pentachlorophenol (PCP) during the
normal course of their work.  PCP was used to treat pine and other
kinds of timber at sawmills around the country from the 1950s until
the 1980s when its use was finally banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCPs are highly toxic and cause a range of health issues to the
workers who were exposed to the chemicals. To date, the Government
has not acknowledged the suffering caused to them or their
families. Contaminated sites still pose an ongoing risk to present
and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today's announcement from Genesis Energy that it's putting on hold its plans to build two coal-fired power stations at Huntly should be taken on board by Mighty River Power with Marsden B, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Genesis cited the lack of available technology for carbon
capture and sequestration as one of the two reasons for putting
coal on hold.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unlike Mighty River Power, Genesis clearly acknowledges the
global warming implications of building a new coal-fired power
station and has opted instead for the cheaper and cleaner
alternatives:  wind and gas," said Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace
campaign manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In total contrast, Mighty River Power refuses to deal with C02
at all and, with Marsden B, is planning to almost double New
Zealand's C02 emissions from coal-fired power stations ," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument that C02 can be captured and buried underground has
been a mantra for the coal industry in its push for coal as an
energy source in New Zealand. However, this technology is decades
away and hugely costly, especially compared with wind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is good to see a State Owned Enterprise talking some energy
sense here in New Zealand," said Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on Mighty River Power to take a leaf out of the
Genesis book, and keep - and grow - its expertise in clean,
renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the huge resource dollars going into carbon capture
and sequestration, and looking for more coal should be ploughed
into renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise has been refused entry to St Kitts, where it was due to arrive two days ago, ahead of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting that will begin on Friday. No official reason has been given to the environmental organisation, despite repeated requests.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            o1201062 - 12th January 2006 - Southern Ocean

Two minke whales flee in front of the harpooner of the Yushin Maru No.2 catcher ship.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artic Sunrise, which was one of two ships that confronted
the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean at the beginning
of the year, was due to be part of Greenpeace's lobbying work at
the meeting, which could see the Japanese led pro-whaling countries
seize control of the IWC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealander, Phil Lloyd who was bosun onboard the Esperanza
during last summer's Southern Ocean whale hunt, is now onboard the
Artic Sunrise near St Kitts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are shocked that St Kitts has banned the Arctic Sunrise and
can only assume that the government of Japan has convinced the St
Kitts authorities to prevent us from entering in the hope that our
criticism of whaling will be silenced," said Phil Lloyd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The St Kitts meeting of the IWC could see the reversal of many
years of whale protection and conservation, with strong indications
that the Japanese government will have bought out enough votes to
take control of the Commission. In that event it is anticipated
that Greenpeace will be ejected from the meeting, after having had
its observer status revoked, secret ballots will be introduced and
the Japanese "scientific" whaling programme will be endorsed by the
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a majority of votes is taken by Japan and other pro-whaling
nations, other moves are likely such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shutting down the conservation committee (this would remove the
focus of the IWC on conservation of cetaceans).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;endorsing "scientific whaling" (previously the IWC has resolved
not to support "scientific whaling").&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;kicking Greenpeace out of the IWC due to fabricated allegations
that the Arctic Sunrise rammed a whaling ship in January (currently
Greenpeace has 'observer status').&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;removing all discussion on the protection of small cetaceans
(so the IWC will no longer discuss responsibility for dolphins and
porpoises). This is the thin edge of the wedge.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;choosing the next chair of the IWC.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;moving to secret voting. This will reduce the transparency and
accountability of countries who's votes have been 'bought', and
make it easier to get a 75% vote majority to resume commercial
whaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The future of the whales hangs in the balance and the refusal
of the Artic Sunrise to enter St Kitts is yet another ominous sign
that whales are for sale at the IWC and criticism is to be
silenced," said Jo McVeagh, whales campaigner for Greenpeace
NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute the IWC meeting opens (overnight Friday NZ time)
things are likely to move fast. By Saturday morning the meeting, IF
it gets the pro-whaling majority we fear, could have already moved
to secret voting, ejected Greenpeace and dumped some hard-won
conservation measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; Recent History of Arctic Sunrise and in Southern Ocean and St Kitts Voting Record

* A notice refusing us entry was sent to the ships agent on June 9 from the Saint Christopher and Nevis Ministry of National Security, Justice, Immigration and Labour.

* Over the 73 days, from November 20th 2005, 57 crew from over 20 countries onboard the Greenpeace ships MY Esperanza and MY Arctic Sunrise travelled 14,500 nautical miles, spent 28 days in contact with the whaling fleet, including 12 days when no whales where killed. Sadly, and despite saving a great many whales by blocking the harpooners shot, they witnessed the brutal death of at least 123 minke whales.

* St. Kitts and Nevis joined the IWC on June 24, 1992 and 5 days later a Commissioner representing St. Kitts and Nevis attended an IWC meeting in Glasgow, Scotland. The Commissioner was absent whenever votes were taken, so St. Kitts cast no votes. After the 1992 meeting, St Kitts and Nevis remained a member, paying fees of around £14,000 a year but did not attend meetings. By 1995, it fell behind in its payments and lost the right to vote, eventually running up a debt to the IWC of about £50,000. In 1998 St. Kitts attended its second IWC meeting, held in Muscat, Oman, but, because of its debt, was not allowed to vote. However it did co-sponsor a resolution to accept the resumption of commercial whaling by Japan. By the time of the 1999 IWC meeting St Kitts' debts had been paid off and it has enjoyed full voting rights ever since. Since 1999, St Kitts has cast 88 votes; 82 have been identical to Japan's and on the votes Japan refused to participate in St. Kitts also refused. On a few occasions St. Kitts has voted when Japan abstained and vice versa. St. Kitts has never cast a vote against Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

	Thoko Makhanya, an African woman who is an advocate for poor farmers (1), will visit New Zealand this week to appeal to the NZ Government to improve its weak position on global rules for trade in genetically engineered organisms and "Terminator" technology.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ms Makhanya is here from the African Centre for Biosafety, at
Greenpeace's invitation, asking that New Zealand support strong
rules for documenting GE shipments through the Biosafety Protocol. 
She is also calling on government to cease its support of lifting
the ban on sterile seed or "terminator" technology due to the 1.4
billion people (mostly poor) who depend on farm saved seed for food
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am appealing to your Government to back a strong Biosafety
Protocol and support Africans having the same rights and
protections that you demand for your own borders - that is the
right to know and the right to say no to imports of GE," said Thoko
Makhanya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand was seen to act like the "stalking horse" for the
world's biggest GE crop exporter - the USA (a non-signatory to the
protocol) -when NZ delegates blocked consensus on strong rules for
documenting GE shipments at the Biosafety Protocol meetings in
Montreal last year. Out of 119 nations, only New Zealand and Brazil
(a major GE crop exporter) objected, holding the consensus based
meeting to ransom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other governments and development and environment NGOs expressed
dismay at New Zealand's part in stopping a decision being made on
the import rules. The outcome was described as "very disappointing"
by the European delegate and "shameful" by a number of NGOs
present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both issues are core sustainable development matters currently
before the New Zealand Cabinet prior to the international UN
meeting in Brazil of the Biosafety Protocol and Convention on
Biodiversity.  These important environmental treaties cover issues
of global food security and safety, biosecurity, environmental
protection and the basic right of farmers to save seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a clear case of a double standard for New Zealand to be
proposing wording on a global documentation system for GE imports
which is weaker than our own import laws," said Greenpeace
Campaigner Steve Abel, who will attend the Biosafety Protocol
meeting in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) Thoko is a human rights practitioner from the African Centre for Biosafety working with rural poor farming communities.  She is a former nurse and is involved in lobby and advocacy work in South Africa. She has knowledge of how GE crops affect farmers in the poorest regions. She is highly respected woman in South Africa and within the province she works.

(2) "Terminator" or sterility technology is a highly proprietary form of GE that was developed by the seed/agrochemical industry in the US specifically to prevent farmers from saving and re-planting harvested seed. "Terminator" undermines farmer's basic right to save seed and is a particular threat to the world's poorest farmer's, global food security and food sovereignty due to the 1.4 billion people depend on saved seed for food.  There has been a global de-facto moratorium on field trials of "Terminator" in place for six years, but the GE industry is pushing for an end to the ban.  New Zealand alone supported Canada's call to lift the moratorium in Montreal last year (2005).&lt;/p&gt;

Due to relentless campaigning by lots of different people, Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal fired power station proposal was abandoned in March 2007.

Today a trio of Greenpeace divers took to the sea to highlight the underwater area that Mighty River Power's plans to discharge its pollution. Meanwhile the trio of protesters who ascended the proposed Marsden B coal fired power station early last Wednesday, remain there on what is now the 8th day of occupation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace diver Phil Woollam says, "Mighty River's Power coal
plant will not be clean. Along with the millions of tonnes of
carbon dioxide emissions to air, the plant will flush sulphur
dioxide and numerous other toxins such as mercury directly into
Bream Bay. The toxins will increase across every level of the food
chain out here".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This week we've seen Mighty River Power claiming that it would
have the 'cleanest-burning coal-fired power station in
Australasia.' But the coal industry's definition of "clean"
wouldn't be found in any dictionary. There is no such thing as
clean coal," said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"After being caught by pollution control devices, pollutants
still have to be disposed of somewhere. In the case of Marsden B
they will either be flushed into the sea or dumped at the toxic ash
site. From where they will eventually leach into the ground water,"
says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power's (MRP) proposed toxic ash dump would cover
50 hectares (equivalent to 68 football fields) and be right
adjacent to Ruakaka township. Toxins such as mercury will also be
discharged via the wastewater outflow into Bream Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's sulphur dioxide (SOX) emissions from thermal
electricity generation increased from 2,067 tonnes in 1990 to
12,417 tonnes in 2003: a massive 500% increase. Mighty River
Power's plans would increase that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor does MRP's resource consent application match its rhetoric.
The company's own application refuses to specify limits on SOX
emissions and will not even commit it to specific sulphur
quantities in the coal it will burn. Cheaper high sulphur coal will
mean that more sulphur dioxide is emitted. Even in its own deeply
flawed application, Mighty River Power estimates that its
emissions, when combined with the NZRC refinery's own emissions,
take the emissions up to 85% of air quality standards, leaving very
little room for error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulphur dioxide is not the only problem with the plant. The
company has no plans at all to remove nitrogen oxides (N0X) from
its stacks. N0X helps cause acid rain and low-level ozone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, when a US company, American Electric Power, tried to
install twin technologies to remove both chemicals in a small town
in the USA, it failed and local people reported burning eyes,
throats and lungs. Eventually, the company spent $20 million and
moved the entire town out. The following year the S0X emissions
increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace are demanding that the Government call in and stop
Marsden B because, as New Zealand's first major coal fired power
station proposal in 25 years, Marsden B is of national and
international significance to the environmental and New Zealand's
renewable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow (Thursday 24 February) is the last day for submissions
on Mighty River Power's plan to burning coal at Marsden B.&lt;/p&gt;

	As activists on the roof of Marsden-B began the third day of their occupation, local people, with a Greenpeace ground team, wearing 'TOXIC WASTE PATROL' patches, marked out the 50 hectare perimeter of Marsden B's proposed toxic coal ash pile with yellow sign-posts and hazard tape.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If the project goes ahead, the company plans to dump sludge from
treatment ponds and ash at the Ruakaka ash site, leaving a 14m high
toxic ash dump adjacent to the sea which would leach persistent
toxins into the environment for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal produces a whole array of pollutants which either
become gases or remain in the ash. Along with the climate-changing
greenhouse gas CO2, Marsden B would produce toxic heavy metals like
arsenic, cadmium, mercury and highly poisonous dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mighty River Power plans to use seawater to capture some of
these pollutants from the ash - but has no plans to treat this
water before discharging it straight back into Bream Bay. For this
reason the company has applied to discharge the following
substances into Bream Bay each year: 8,760 kg of arsenic; 4,208 kg
of lead, 262 kg of cadmium and 192.7 kg of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This area would contain perhaps the most blatant of the toxic
legacies from Marsden B," said Greenpeace campaigner Steve
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River Power's plans to contain the toxic releases into
this beautiful environment are, quite frankly, pathetic. Thousands
of tonnes of toxic ash and waste would be trucked and dumped right
beside the Ruakaka township every week for 25 years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When Mighty River Power walks away from Marsden B in 25 years
time they will wash their hands of the toxins they have poured onto
the land air and water. In this way the real costs of burning coal
are paid for by the locals, the environment and future
generations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has signed the Stockholm Convention - an
international agreement that promises we will reduce the creation
of "persistant organic pollutants" - including dioxins. Creating a
toxic coal ash dump for Marsden B would directly undermine our
commitments under this agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is alongside our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to
combat climate change. Global warming will also increase sea level
rises and make the ash pile more susceptible to a fluctuating water
table and extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed ash dumpsite is also subject to a Treaty of
Waitangi claim by Patuharakeke hapu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the Government take responsibility
for this toxic, climate-changing coal project and halt it as part
of establishing a sustainable energy strategy for New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

Due to relentless campaigning by lots of different people, Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal fired power station proposal was abandoned in March 2007.

Today is the fifth day of the Greenpeace occupation of Marsden B. At midday, around 500 people marched and gathered on the beach beneath the dormant power station in protest at Mighty River Power's plans to convert it to coal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace-organised "Stop Marsden B-each Day Out" drew
strong local support from Ruakaka and Whangarei residents, along
with people from as far away as the Bay of Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They represented the local hapu, play centres, the fire service
and schools. Young and old, with hand-made banners, gathered at the
gates of the power station, and marched to Bream Bay beach chanting
'No to coal' and 'Yes to wind.'  There, they stood side by side to
spell out two human messages in the sand:  NO COAL and STOP MARSDEN
B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now five days since Greenpeace activists scaled Marsden B
early on Wednesday morning and set up their occupation. The three
remaining activists are resolute in their determination to stay
until the Government acts to stop Marsden B.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Being up here to support the extraordinary local opposition
against this environmentally insane idea is a real privilege.
Seeing everyone below us today strengthens our resolve to stay here
until the Government or Mighty River Power stop Marsden B," said
Wellington activist Kate Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This sort of public turnout must break the Government's
resounding silence on Marsden B," said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve
Abel.  "Instead of pretending there's nothing happening, the
Government needs to take the matter in hand by stopping Marsden B
coal and establishing New Zealand's energy future as clean,
sustainable and renewable."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            ON Valentines day Greenpeace activists presented RFMO meeting  delegates at Te Papa in Wellington with a rose and a poem each. The poem: Roses are red, The High Seas are blue, Implement strong interim measures and The world will love you.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four days will see 150 delegates from 28 countries
discuss how to manage the international waters of the South Pacific
Ocean and Tasman Sea. Greenpeace is calling for the meeting to
agree to a temporary ban on bottom trawling whilst the discussions
pan out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have faith in this meeting's ability to do the right thing.
The delegates can show their devotion to the amazing creatures in
the deep sea by placing a temporary ban on bottom trawling in this
area. The public will love them for it," said Carmen Gravatt,
Greenpeace oceans campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Valentines poem attached to a red rose reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Roses are red,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;The high seas are blue,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Implement strong interim measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;And the world will love you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Volumes of scientific evidence, Greenpeace's documentation and
Ministry of Fisheries images all show that the damage in the deep
sea from bottom trawling is extensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A temporary ban on bottom trawling in the areas under
discussion is essential. If we wait for years until the talks are
resolved, habitats and species deserving protection could be gone
forever", concluded Ms Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today urged the public and all political parties to support Sue Kedgley's "Consumer right to know" labelling bill.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Labelling of where food comes from and what went into making it
is the beginning of the most basic consumer information on food,"
says Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel.  "Such information will help
the public do right by the environment because it gives people a
clear choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, buying local food is an excellent way to reduce the
amount of carbon dioxide emissions that are caused by transporting
food. Without country of origin labelling consumers don't know if
their tomatoes or ham has come from the other side of the world or
just up the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing carbon dioxide is crucial to stopping catastrophic
climate change impacts - the biggest environmental problem facing
the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise avoiding GE crop derived foods means avoiding the
excess use of herbicide and the potential risks to the environment
and health associated with GE crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For six years Greenpeace has produced a GE Free Food Guide in
an attempt to fill the gap left by New Zealand's inadequate GE food
labelling laws," says Abel. This bill would bring GE labelling into
line with European standards and give consumers what they should
have had the right to know all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper labelling of GE also gives due credit to the majority of
food companies that have already eliminated GE derived ingredients
and forces the GE industry to stand by it's products instead of
sneaking it into our food without a label.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today questioned the Government's take on what its policy on Terminator technology actually means.
&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/image/2006/12/corn-grenade.jpg" title=""&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content no-title"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Corn grenade: the winning image from the Greenpeace Seeds of Trouble competition
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sterile seed technology is the central point in discussions
at an international meeting in Brazil today, and New Zealand, with
Canada and Australia, is again under the international spotlight
for supporting an anti-environmental position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government has gotten half way on its position by
recognising the dangers this technology poses to 1.4 billion of the
world's poorest people who depend on saved seed for survival. But
it doesn't understand the dangers inherent in opening up the
present de-facto moratorium (1) to a "case by case" basis," said
Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace New Zealand's Campaign Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said the Government was totally confusing scientific
arguments with what was essentially a social and development issue.
Such a position goes against New Zealand's goals of poverty
elimination and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Field trials will not determine the acceptability of this
sterile seed technology. If it works 100% then it will be a threat
to the 1.4 billion people around the world who rely on saved seed
for next year's crop. If it doesn't work and it's not 100% sterile,
then it's a contamination threat which, once released into the
environment, cannot be stopped."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Possums? Scientific nonsense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace said that the Environment Minister David Benson-Pope
had used an unfortunate example to illustrate his [incorrect] point
that the technology in question could be used in the future - for
example to eradicate possums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This statement illustrates a fundamental lack of understanding
of basic scientific principles. This is a technology developed for
crops, not animals. This ridiculous statement has had scientists in
Brazil, New Zealand - and beyond - howling with laughter," said
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, the prospect of New Zealand tampering with marsupial
genes would send the Australian Government into a frenzy of
biosecurity regulation against New Zealand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Possums might be a pest in New Zealand, but to our closest
neighbours they are a protected species," concluded Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Industry the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final argument against New Zealand's position is that the
multinational agricultural industry cannot be trusted - and New
Zealand should already be aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a global regime, this industry is likely to target
countries with weak legislation to set up Terminator crop trials -
or do it illegally. Two recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seed companies already have a record of deliberately
contaminating crops and working outside government regulations.
Only this week, biotech multinational Syngenta was fined around
$700,000 by the Brazilian Government for conducting illegal field
trials of GE soy in a buffer zone around the Iguacu Falls World
Heritage Site in Brazil. The field trials were discovered by
Greenpeace and reported to the Brazilian Government.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Already, such technologies are ready to apply the "case by
case" basis that NZ is talking about. Peruvian farmers are very
concerned about Syngenta's patent (US Patent 6,700,039) because it
describes a GURTS technology that could be used to prevent the
sprouting of potatoes, unless they are treated with chemicals
supplied by the patent owner. Local farmers would be prevented from
saving and reusing terminator type seeds and storage organs such as
potato tubers, thus increasing corporate control over the global
food system. Indigenous people fear that it would destroy the
sharing of seeds, a centuries-old tradition, and with it their
cultural and social way of life. Potatoes originate in Peru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Today Greenpeace released 185 images taken on board bottom trawlers by fisheries observers. The images were obtained from the Ministry of Fisheries under the Official Information Act.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The photos were snapped over the 2004 and 2005 fishing years ?
the same period that the debate over bottom trawling has been
raging and the industry has been downplaying the destructive
impacts on deep-sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damning photos show a wide diversity of deep-sea life that
is being dragged up from the deep-sea floor including bizarre
crabs, strange octopus, ancient Gorgonian corals and CITES-listed
endangered black coral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These photos are embarrassing for the fishing industry and the
Government who have failed to support progressive moves to protect
deep-sea life from bottom trawling in international waters at the
United Nations," said oceans campaigner Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the New Zealand, Australian and Chilean Governments
host an international fisheries meeting at Te Papa. The meeting
will draw over 150 delegates from over 25 countries to discuss
setting up a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) that
would manage the international waters of the Tasman Sea and South
Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are few rules in international waters and bottom
trawlers have exploited the situation for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A temporary ban on bottom trawling in the areas under
discussion is essential. History has shown us that bottom trawling
companies are ruthless. If we wait for years until the talks are
resolved, habitats and species deserving protection could be gone
forever", said Ms Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observer photos add further weight to evidence collected
over the past two years by Rainbow Warrior expeditions into the
international waters of the Tasman Sea. Both trips exposed New
Zealand fishing companies destroying life in the deep sea to catch
orange roughy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fishing industry has betrayed the public by portraying
bottom trawling as having a minimal effect. These images expose
what the bottom trawling industry has used weasel words to deny:
that every year bottom trawling is causing extensive damage to
fragile and ancient life on the sea floor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although 185 photos sounds a lot, the sample is small, because
less than 5% of New Zealand-flagged deep sea bottom trawlers have
observers on board and not all these observers take photos.
However, they offer persistent and undeniable proof of bottom
trawling's devastating impacts", concluded Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deep sea hosts the largest pool of undiscovered life on
Earth. Because so many species are only found in localised areas,
scientists are warning that species can be wiped out by bottom
trawling before they've even been named.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace applauds the initiative of the 'Save Happy Valley' campaign to begin an occupation of the proposed Happy Valley coal mine site on Saturday, as part of their campaign to stop the project.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Coal is a health and environmental villain from mine to sky. It
destroys biodiversity and waterways at the mine, when burnt
releases toxins such as mercury and dioxin which pose a serious
threat to human health and it contributes to climate change - the
most serious threat facing the planet today." said Greenpeace
Campaign Manager Cindy Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the recent news from NASA that 2005 was the hottest year
on record and scientists are warning us that we have only 10 years
to avoid climate catastrophe, it is clear that dirty old coal has
no future, either taken from the Happy Valley mine or burnt at the
proposed Marsden B power station."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is widespread concern about climate change and it is
inspiring to see community members at the forefront of the battle
to protect the climate, by taking direct action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers can also help protect the climate by making the switch
to a clean, renewable electricity provider using Greenpeace's Clean
Energy Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand needs to address climate change and protect our
environment by developing a long term strategy encouraging
renewable technology such as wind farms, stopping climate-polluting
power sources such as Marsden B and increasing energy efficiency,"
concluded Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three Greenpeace activists have been arrested after police cut through chains that were blockading the entrances of Auckland based timber company The LumberBank.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit together with landowners from
Papua New Guinea (PNG) closed The LumberBank for over four hours
today accusing them of importing timber from illegal operations in
PNG and selling it here in NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We asked the LumberBank to allow a public inspection of their
timber yard and for them to provide proof that their timber was
legally sourced from PNG", said PNG Landowner Representative
Dorothy Tekwie. "They refused our request, and we suspect it's
because they cannot provide that proof."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders have a right to know that timber they buy to
improve their homes is not fuelling the destruction of our forest
homes and livelihoods," said Tekwie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All we ask is that the New Zealand Government live up to their
own 2002 election promise(1) and immediately place import
restrictions on illegal timber coming into this country. This is
just one example of the global trade in illegal timber from the
Asia/Pacific region," said Tekwie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Logan Petley, Michael McTernan and Jenny Mulcock are
in the Auckland District Court.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dropping the carbon tax shows a remarkable absence of
leadership across Parliament on the most catastrophic problem
facing the planet," said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel today.
"Greenpeace always maintained that the carbon tax was not hefty
enough - but the response should have been to increase it, not drop
it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Government has dropped the last meaningful policy from its
package of action on climate change.  Basically, Dunne and Peters
said, 'jump' and Labour said 'how high?' "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is already hitting hard and is expected to get a
lot worse if we do nothing. Scientists last week released a new
study showing more polar bears may be drowning due to the shrinking
ice cap - they face extinction within the century (2); farmers in
New Zealand are being hammered by droughts, storm damage and floods
and people are losing their homes here and abroad in extreme
weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon charges - putting a cost on emissions of the key gas
which causes climate change: carbon dioxide - are an inspired
idea.  They mean taxing something we want less of - pollution, and
encouraging what we want more of - clean and efficient industry and
transport.  The carbon charge would particularly make the dirtiest
industries, like the coal industry, pay a little for the pollution
they produce.  That's only fair because right now that pollution
costs us all - in health costs and in the environmental, social and
economic impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those economic signals are essential for getting business to
clean up its act - which is why the dirtiest and least efficient
industries are so against carbon tax," said Abel.  Meanwhile the
international insurance industry, such as Swiss Re, supports carbon
taxes as a way forward (3) and the International Energy Agency has
recently criticised Australia for not putting a price on carbon
(4). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a carbon charge, the Marsden B proposal - the
first major coal-fired power station in the country for over 25
years, could go ahead with absolutely no consideration of climate
change at any stage (5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenpeace calls on the Government to immediately: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enact meaningful legislation to bring down emissions now,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Amend the RMA to make it clear that councils must take climate
change into account when considering high C02 emission projects
like coal-fired power stations,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Call an immediate halt to Marsden B at the very least until
some other method of considering climate effects of this project is
in place,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Urgently develop a sustainable energy strategy for New Zealand
which will see a phase out of fossil fuels and transition to a 100%
renewable energy electricity sector.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Carry out a full cost analysis of the impacts of climate change
on New Zealand including environmental, economic and social.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

of renewable energy enables a reduction in the discharge into air
of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

	The international fisheries meeting in Wellington today ended disappointingly with states failing to take any action to protect life in the deep sea from the destruction caused by high seas bottom trawling.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are warning that species are being pushed to
extinction by high seas bottom trawling before they've even been
named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Environment groups and thousands of people from around the
world called on states to take urgent action and issue a temporary
ban on bottom trawling in the international waters of the South
Pacific while negotiations are under way," said Cath Wallace of the
Environment and Conservation Organisations of NZ (ECO) "Instead
they have chosen to sit on their hands and sacrifice deep-sea life
while talks continue for many years."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The failure to implement a temporary ban again shows that
Regional Fisheries Management Organisations are unable to deal with
the destruction of life in the deep sea. Clearly the solution is a
global moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters
through the UN," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace oceans
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation International, Sue Miller Taei, Pacific Islands
marine manager, said "We welcome the initiative of many Pacific
Island States including Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu, and France in
respect of its territories to push for interim protection of
deep-sea life from bottom trawling. Vanuatu summed up the meeting
well by saying that the real issues was being hidden under the
carpet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly fishing nations blocked the Pacific proposal for
an immediate temporary ban on bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorraine Hitch from WWF said that it was also disappointing that
governments appeared to be already going down the track of a
sectoral fisheries management approach which has so spectacularly
failed the world's oceans to date, rather than adopting a
CCAMLR-like ecosystem based management approach to this new
regional governance arrangement for the South Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given the lack of action this week, New Zealand's position of
not supporting a moratorium in RFMOs under negotiation surely
becomes untenable. Just as much deep-sea life is being wiped out
today as last week. There is still no protection in place and
nothing in the way of specific measures has been adopted to protect
the environment", said Cath Wallace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This cycle of talk and no action was seen clearly this week,
when the European Commission told a United Nations meeting in New
York that the evidence of actual destruction of ecosystems is
overwhelming, that there is clearly felt sense of urgency and that
action must be taken, whereas in the meeting in Wellington, the EU
suggested no specific measures for an interim ban on bottom
trawling on the high seas. The next meeting is scheduled for over 8
months away. In the meantime, ancient deep water corals are being
smashed."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today criticised the decision of ERMA to approve Crop and Foods GE onions. This is an experiment that ERMA themselves concede has little environmental or economic benefit and is a waste of research funding (1) yet they have given it the go ahead, said Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel. Crop and Food are now entitled to spend ten years of taxpayers money on developing a GE onion that nobody here or in our major markets wants (2).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The main argument for these onions is that they will reduce
herbicide use but the most comprehensive data just released shows
that these sorts of GE crops have increased herbicide use by over
22 million kilos in the US (3), said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information further undermines the continuing claims by
Crop and Food that Roundup Ready GE onions will reduce herbicide
use and calls into question Crop and Foods scientific honesty given
their failure to acknowledge this independent evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These GE onions, like all GE crops, are such a marginal prospect
that it makes a particular mockery of the research funding
decisions of Crown Research Institutes such as Crop and Food and
the assessment process of ERMA. Why should the NZ taxpayer be
supporting the development of a GE food crop that our export
markets dont want (3) and 80 per cent of New Zealanders dont want
growing here either? (4) said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crop and Food should re-invest the GE onion money into improving
and expanding our already successful and burgeoning organic onion
industry in New Zealand. This industry has eliminated synthetic
herbicide use and is getting significant premiums on onion exports
to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abel concluded however that; GE onions are highly unlikely to
ever see commercial production in New Zealand. I suspect the
experiment will die a death from lack of relevance and funding and
so prove to have been a waste of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace opposes the release of GE organisms because of
potential irreversible risks to the environment and food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The uncertainty about the long term environmental benefits
of herbicide-tolerance technology invites the conclusion that this
is not soundly based use of research funding. This decision under
the HSNO Act should thus not be seen as an endorsement of the
decision to fund this research, Pg 27, 2.6.5.16. The Committee
concludes that this research is uncertain in terms of its potential
to yield economic or environmental benefits, relative to other
possible research, Pg 27, 2.6.5.17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) UK (25.61%), Europe (48.87%) and Japan (5.45%) are New
Zealands biggest export markets for onions with 80% of onion
exports going to these regions in 2002 (NZ Department of
Statistics). These are all markets renowned for their sensitivity
and aversion to GE foods.&lt;/p&gt;

	At the opening of a major international conference today on deep sea fisheries, major conservation organizations including IUCN-The World Conservation Organization, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Greenpeace called for immediate protection of seamounts, cold water corals and other vulnerable deep sea habitats from damaging deep seabed trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Concern for high seas biodiversity and the sustainability of
deep sea fisheries has been growing in recent years as scientists
and conservationists have begun to learn more about vulnerable deep
sea environments. Recent scientific exploration of seamounts and
cold water coral reefs indicate that they can be hotspots of marine
biodiversity. As many as fifty percent of the species observed
during recent seamount cruises have been new to science,
representing unique species of which little is known. Deep-sea
species such as corals and sponges typically are slow-growing and
long-lived, which makes them particularly sensitive to disturbance.
Fish inhabiting these deep sea ecosystems can live for up to 150
years and sometimes reach reproductive maturity at 30 years of age,
characteristics making them especially vulnerable to overfishing. A
WWF report released last week concluded that overfishing of deep
sea Orange Roughy has led to severe stock declines all around the
world, accompanied by dramatic impacts on deep sea ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seabed trawling is the primary threat to deep sea environments,
due to the destructive nature of the technique. The nets completely
destroy bottom habitats like cold water coral reefs - some of which
are thousands of years old - in a single trawl. A preliminary study
commissioned by IUCN, NRDC, WWF, and Conservation International has
found that high seas bottom trawling is limited to a small number
of vessels and countries and the amount and value of the catch is
less than 1% of global marine capture fisheries production.
Moreover, the assessment found that bottom trawling on the high
seas is almost completely unregulated. Only a handful of
international Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs)
have authority to regulate bottom fishing, and few if any have
restricted the practice to protect sensitive ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year at both the Tenth Deep-Sea Biology Symposium
in Coos Bay, Oregon in August, and the Second International
Symposium on Deep Sea Corals in Erlangen, Germany in September,
more than 100 scientists signed a Statement of Concern to the
United Nations General Assembly regarding the risks to seamounts,
cold-water corals and other vulnerable ecosystems of the deep sea.
Among other recommendations, they urged the UN General Assembly to
adopt an immediate moratorium on bottom trawl fishing on the high
seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Seamounts, deep sea corals and other deep ocean features
represent a treasure trove of biodiversity that belongs to all
nations," said Lisa Speer, Senior Policy Analyst with the New York
based Natural Resources Defense Council. "International action to
protect them from the devastating impacts of bottom trawling is
urgently needed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bottom trawling for orange roughy on seamounts around the world
has decimated Orange Roughy populations," said Simon Cripps,
director of WWF's Endangered Seas Programme. "If we don't take
immediate measures to regulate and better manage the fisheries,
Orange roughy will become commercially extinct."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that bottom trawl fisheries on the high seas are
largely unregulated represents an important gap in the governance
of the world's oceans, said Kristina Gjerde, high seas policy
advisor to IUCN's Global Marine Programme." A moratorium on high
seas bottom trawling to protect seamounts and other vulnerable
habitats would provide time to develop an enforceable legal
regime".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It appears that high seas bottom trawl fishing constitutes at
present only about 0.2 percent of global marine fisheries capture
production, and approximately 0.5% of the estimated value of the
global marine fish catch in 2001" said Matthew Gianni, independent
consultant and author of the WWF, NRDC, IUCN and CI-commissioned
report(1) on High Seas Bottom Fisheries. "A moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling would not have a widespread economic impact nor
significantly affect fish supplies, prices or food security."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The deep sea is rapidly being plundered," said, Carmen Gravatt.
Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace in New Zealand. "The shift towards
deep sea fish is only another attempt to temporarily escape the
global depletion of fish stocks. The last unknown wilderness should
not be sacrificed for short term economic profit."&lt;/p&gt;

	Today the federal police in Belem, Brazil concluded the enquiry into the death of Greenpeace activist Emily Craddock in the Amazon. The files will now be delivered to the Federal judge who will rule on the cause of death in the New Year, however the police have stated that they are satisfied that her death was not suspicious.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Arrangements are now being made to fly Emily's body home to
England. The crew of the Greenpeace ship, the MV Arctic Sunrise,
which was campaigning against illegal logging in the Amazon, will
also being going home today. The ship and replacement crew will
remain in Belem until resupplied with fuel and food and then also
depart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily's family and Greenpeace have released the following
tribute to their much loved daughter and friend, and dedicated the
recent Amazon tour in her memory. The family now ask that their
privacy will be respected, and that they are left in peace to deal
with their grief at this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Craddock, father&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerd Leipold, Executive Director,Greenpeace International&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRIBUTE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily Claire Craddock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.01.1976 - 12.12.2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily was born in a blizzard, on January 19th 1976. Never one to
play with dolls or do anything she considered silly, she was
something of a challenge to her teachers at Hampstead Hill School,
St Mary's Convent and St Christopher's in Letchworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At four years old, when she caught her mother pouring boiling
water on a column of ants (as her mother preferred them in the
garden, not the kitchen), she protested furiously - her blue eyes
blazing under that blonde mop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of nine she became a Greenpeace supporter and was
actively campaigning by the time she was ten, producing a school
project on how cutting down trees in the Amazon caused famine in
Africa and floods in North India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our eco-warrior never lacked for courage. At fifteen she took
herself off -alone - to go and work on the Turtle Protection
Project on the Island of Zakynthos. While the local Greek people
would rather put the profit of hotel building ahead of the
preservation of the nesting habit, Emily helped change their views.
Those turtles and their nesting grounds are now protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily loved sports of all kinds, skiing in stunning mountains,
scuba diving within that wonderful water-world, and she was
passionate about football, outstripping her trainer brothers in
skill and eventually playing for Tottenham Ladies. It was a passion
she shared with her beloved Dad and the pair was a familiar sight
in the west stand at White Hart Lane. Her sporting prowess was
matched by her intellect. Aware of the power of politicians and
appalled by war, her dissertation for her politics degree, at
Loughborough University, was on the major actors in the Arab-
Israeli conflict. The late King Hussein helped her with her
research. He kindly remembered how, in Indonesia, this blonde child
had introduced herself to tell him his bodyguards' trousers were
too long and made them look undignified, then asked him for a
dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Emily first worked for the Lottery's Charity
Fund helping charitable organisations achieve the necessary funding
for their work. She then worked as a teacher and continued to do so
when on leave, sharing her love of this beautiful world with many
children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily had an extraordinary ability to communicate with people of
all ages and walks in life. She was still in regular, caring
contact with her postman Harry, ten years after his retirement. Ems
seemed to make an almost instant but lasting bond at a genuine and
memorable level with those people she met. She loved animals, could
calm the most frightened horses, but considered it wrong to train
her dog Georgie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, when Emily was in Australia visiting her brother, she
saw Greenpeace's ship, the Arctic Sunrise, docked in Fremantle for
repairs after clashes with a Japanese whaler. To be taken
seriously, she cut off her long blonde hair (which she had made
into wigs for kiddies undergoing chemotherapy), marched up the
gangplank and asked for a job - any job. She was THRILLED to have a
job at last with Greenpeace - as a garbologist, sorting the
rubbish! Whenever and wherever her Greenpeace ship docked, she
would go ashore with her football and soon have a game going with
the local people - her own personal form of communication with
people of all languages. She was regularly seen in the last two
months in the Amazon raising a game with the local children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, her family and many friends followed
her via the internet - relieved that by the time Greenpeace actions
were posted, the greatest danger was over. She studied hard to
learn about the essential equipment on board to eventually become
Radio Operator, where she was the smooth voice on the other end of
the line calling her fellow campaigners us home after along day
chained to an anchor or investigations in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She never missed a chance to brighten others lives. "How are
you?" someone would ask her over the line. "All the better for
hearing your lovely voice," she would reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are cherished photos of her with Russian children after
planting trees in a vast concrete estate, in her protective
chemical suit, and with the people of Papua, New Guinea and many
more. Everyone held their breath during the whaling campaigns and
when she sat in a small dingy in the path of an American missile
being tested and during all the bold, courageous campaigns in her
four years with Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was passionate about Greenpeace, so happy to be a part of
this organisation which shared her beliefs, was bold enough to go
out there and protest; fight for our world and those who cannot
fight for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily was a bright, shiny person who brought love and happiness
into anyone's life that she touched. Passionate, strong and
determined, with a healthy and well-developed sense of natural
justice, and a desire to stand-up for those who have no voice, or
cannot defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily died in the most beautiful place on Earth that she had
ever seen, and in her years of sailing the world with Greenpeace,
she saw much. She wrote of the Amazon in a crew web diary in
November of this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you imbibe all the beauty here you cannot help but pray to
Gaia or God to protect this area. This is to me how the Amazon
should be, lots of trees overhanging the river and heaving with
bounty. Not the deforested naked grasslands we have been seeing too
much of during this trip. We need to ensure that this way of life
is passed on for more generations to come."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of us who remain, and all of us who were touched by
Emily's life, her words are emblematic of the love and hope she
inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of Emily's weblogs and writings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are in the Amazon wow! There are so many trees to hug I
don't know how I am going to do any radio work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon tour, November 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we sail past plumes of smoke rising from the jungle I feel
like we are witnessing the funeral of another hectare of trees in a
land that can not afford to lose any more to illegal logging. There
are a one hundred and seventy Indian nationalities and one thousand
species of birds that we know of living here. The illegal logging,
the soya plantations, cattle ranching and road building are making
them all slowly but steadily homeless. I don't want to show my
future grandchildren pictures of how wonderful the Amazon was. I
want them to be able to see it with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon tour weblog, November 10 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this evening we received a call on the VHF radio to say
that an empty logging barge was on its way to our ship and it had
fifteen angry loggers on board. My heart fell in to my shoes. We
have had extensive security training on board and I trust all the
crew around me to take sensible decisions, yet the not knowing is
terrifying. An armed attack against our ship is a distinct
possibility. We are highly unpopular and this is not a place where
disagreements are solved by a meeting around a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon tour weblog, November 27 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give people some hope for their children, for these children
have the widest smiles I have ever seen. There are injustices all
over the world every day but you have the chance to be part of the
team working here for better futures for the people of Pra through
the extractive reserve - Resex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a letter to the government, become a cyber activist or just
promise yourself to be an informed eco-consumer of Forest
Stewardship Council timber. If you cannot get FSC wood where you
are then get on the case! You might think it is not worth it, that
your small voice does not matter, but I tell you that Mora and
family will appreciate it when they can retain their livelihood and
keep the lungs of the world breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today commended Foodstuffs (Pams) on the announcement of their new non-GE policy. This non-GE commitment by the owners of the Pams and Budget brands is great news for New Zealand consumers, said Greenpeace GE Campaigner Steve Abel.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It shows the strength of the public demand for non-GE food and
makes a mockery of the Governments faith in GE crops being a
money-spinner, said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows that moratorium or no-moratorium the consumer
driven tide continues to run against GE crops. Non-GE commitments
by major industry players such as Foodstuffs make the prospects for
GE crops ever more marginal. If people wont buy GE and food
companies wont sell it, then whos going to grow it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodstuffs announced today that they are seeking commitments
from their suppliers that all ingredients are sourced from non-GE
crops including feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOODSTUFFS PRESS RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest grocery retailer seeks GE-free assurances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodstuffs, the largest and the only fully New Zealand-owned
grocery retailer, is taking action to ensure that all of its
private label products, which includes the icon Pam's brand, do not
contain GE ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are seeking confirmation from our suppliers that all
ingredients used in the manufacture of our private label brands are
sourced from non GE crops," says Foodstuffs NZ Managing Director
Tony Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This also includes the assurance that non GE feed ingredients
are used in relation to animal products," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are aware that most of our private label suppliers already
comply and we can give assurances of the non-GE status of the
majority of our private label products including bread, chicken,
biscuits and margarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However we are seeking written confirmation from all suppliers
so that we can categorically state that our house brands are
manufactured using non-GE ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If that confirmation is not forthcoming, then the company will
look for alternative sources of supply," says Mr Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says the move formalises Foodstuffs' position on sourcing
non-GE products for its house brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are aware there are a number of New Zealanders who would
prefer eating non-GE foods and we want to make sure that our
customers have that choice."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today condemned the decision to give Solid Energy's Cypress coal mine the go ahead, on the west coast.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Cypress coal mine is yet another nail in the coffin for the
climate. How many extreme weather events like Feburary's storms do
we need until decision makers realise that our climate can't
tolerate a continued reliance of fossil fuels like coal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February's storms cost New Zealand over $265 million. Last
year's European heat wave and drought cost 35,000 lives and 13
billion pounds worldwide. These are the real costs of climate
change but our decision makers seem to conveniently forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government can not on the one hand acknowledge that climate
change is a real problem and then on the other allow more coal
mines like Cypress and to continue to allow energy decisions to be
made totally disconnected from their climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an energy strategy for New Zealand that will lead to a
sustainable energy system, but not at the expense of the climate or
the rest of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace joined King Neptune and his deep sea court in Wellington today as he issued a trespass notice to bottom trawlers at the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council (SeaFIC) (1) board meeting.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;SeaFIC is funded by the fishing industry and lobbies for
policies advantageous to the industry (2). Three members of the
SeaFIC board represent major bottom trawl companies - Sanford,
Sealord and Talleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists dressed as deep sea creatures attended King
Neptune's court outside the venue of the SeaFIC board meeting. The
evidence placed before King Neptune was an ice chest with bycatch
recovered by the Rainbow Warrior on its recent expedition into the
Tasman Sea. The mythical lord of the ocean, King Neptune expressed
his frustration at the damage being done to his deep sea kingdom by
bottom trawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Enough is enough," the marine noble proclaimed. "The ancient
coral forests of the deep sea are being destroyed for the sake of a
few fish. Your scientists have hardly begun to discover the
mysterious life of my deep sea kingdom but the bottom trawlers are
continuing to destroy it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If your land-lubber Governments won't put a stop to this
senseless destruction then I will. I hereby issue a trespass notice
to SeaFIC. Tell your bottom trawlers to keep out of my ocean,"
thundered a defiant King Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SeaFIC representatives have been outspoken in their opposition
to a United Nations moratorium on high seas bottom trawling. Over
1000 marine scientists and an international coalition of
environmental groups, including Greenpeace are supporting the
moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace oceans campaigner Carmen Gravatt said, "This
moratorium would allow time to assess what is in the deep sea, sort
out where and how fishing could occur sustainably and put in place
legally binding agreements to protect the deep sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"SeaFIC represents all the fishing industry in New Zealand, but
the destruction of the few bottom trawl companies and organisations
in SeaFIC makes all the fishing industry look bad. SeaFIC should
act responsibly for sustainable fisheries and support the call for
a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling," concluded Ms
Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) SeaFIC is an organisation funded by a levy on member fishing
companies. Its role is to support commercial stakeholders and
promote the seafood industry. Much of what SeaFIC does concerns
influencing government policies that impact the industry at both
the national and international stage such as bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior has arrived in Wellington Harbour with evidence of the destructive impacts of bottom trawl fishing on the high seas.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We've been in the Tasman Sea witnessing first hand the
destruction of deep sea life through bottom trawling. Now we're
here in Wellington to show the Government that urgent action is
needed to protect the unique and fragile environment of the deep
sea", said Greenpeace oceans campaigner Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be void of life, scientists now estimate between
500,000 to 100,000,000 species live in the deep sea. Many of these
species are situated around seamounts - underwater mountains.
Scientists consider bottom trawling to be the greatest threat to
deep sea life. Greenpeace and a coalition of international
environmental groups have joined an urgent call by over 1000
scientists for an immediate moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the Rainbow Warrior crew found black coral - and
endangered CITES listed species - that had been broken off by a
trawl net, brought to the surface and discarded by a bottom trawler
in the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have documented the destruction caused by bottom trawlers,
including New Zealand vessels on the high seas. Bottom trawling is
a global problem and it needs a global solution. A United Nations
moratorium is the only option that will ensure the immediate
protection of deep sea life, " concluded Ms Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the Fisheries Minister's comments last week
acknowledging that bottom trawling does "considerable damage" to
the marine environment. The Government has already closed 19
seamounts in New Zealand waters to bottom trawling. Our own NIWA
scientists also confirm that bottom trawling is a highly damaging
practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moratorium will allow time for deep sea life to be assessed
and for legally binding protection and fisheries management
measures to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only a short time until negotiations start on final
recommendations for action to the United Nations general assembly,
tie is running out for the New Zealand Government to make up their
minds about how they want to respond to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

	A report by NIWA released yesterday warned that 90% of Westport could be inundated in up to one metre of water during a one in a hundred year flood. Greenpeace warns this could be the tip of the iceberg for the West Coast town.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"NIWA's report estimates that large scale flooding of the
Orawaiti and Buller Rivers will occur once every hundred years",
said climate change campaigner, Annette Cotter. "We have heard
similar predictions for our eastern hydro lakes - that droughts
would reduce their electricity generation during one in one hundred
'dry years'. But the hydro lakes have had three of these dry years
in the past ten."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change means that we will face more and more extreme
weather events, and weather patterns will change considerably. For
New Zealand, this means greater rainfall and flooding on the West
Coast."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Other predictions are more intense and frequent droughts on the
eastern side of the country. We must take climate change seriously
because it is going to effect us economically, socially and
environmentally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change is the most serious problem the world faces now
and into the future. Even big business is concerned, with the
insurance industry in particular addressing whether they will
insure against increasingly devastating weather events. If they
refuse cover, individuals will carry the cost burden when these
floods and droughts occur," said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is mostly caused by burning fossil fuels such as
coal, oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent global need to address the effects of global
warming. Currently a global Climate Change Conference (COP9) is
being held in Milan, Italy. This international meeting is
discussing implementation measures of the Kyoto Protocol - the
international treaty designed to reduce the amount of climate
changing gases each country produces.&lt;/p&gt;

            o2212155 - 22 December 2005 - SOUTHERN OCEAN -

Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza and her inflatables , try to hinder the shooting and eventual  transfer of a minke whale by the Yushin Maru No.2 catcher ship. After two and a half hours of running the gauntlet between the harpoon and the whale the activists witnessed the eventual kill of the whale. Greenpeace is using every peaceful means available means to bring the hunt to an early end and make it the last time the Sanctuary is breached by the whalers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships - Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise - are
attempting to halt the slaughter of minke and fin whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand whales campaigner Pia Mancia said that
the images coming out of the Southern Ocean were sobering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The people of the world thought that they put an end to whaling
when an international ban was put in place in 1984, yet here we are
in the 21st century with commercial whaling being carried out on
New Zealand's doorstep."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time the Greenpeace ship Esperanza - with two New
Zealanders on board - stopped the crews loading dead whales on to
the factory ship Nisshin Maru by blocking the stern ramp, but
withdrew after one of the catcher ships, the Kyo Maru Number One,
attempted to push her out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight inflatable boats with crew from the two Greenpeace ships -
Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise - carried banners calling for an end
to whaling, and Yuko Hirono from Greenpeace's Japanese office made
a radio call to the whaling ships to leave the whale sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that the Greenpeace ships would continue their
campaign to thwart the Japanese fleet in its whaling activities and
to expose its activities to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They say that this is scientific whaling, but scientists say
this work is not needed, and the meat from the 1000 whales that
will be killed will end up on the shelves of Japanese
supermarkets," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is commercial whaling, and it's got to stop. If we can't
even save the whales, what hope is there for the planet?"&lt;/p&gt;

	United Nations Meeting: The destruction of the deep seas will continue to accelerate after New Zealand officials failed to oppose Iceland, Japan, and other countries that blocked proposals for protection of the High Seas at a United Nations meeting on oceans in New York.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Text from joint chairs of the UN meeting put forward a slate of
measures to protect ocean life from the devastating impacts of
bottom trawling. The move reflected widespread scientific and
environmental concern at the impacts of this fishing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite scientific evidence that bottom trawling is responsible
for large-scale destruction of deep-sea biodiversity, several
delegations from fishing countries blocked moves to prohibit high
seas bottom trawling under pressure from fisheries ministries in
their countries. Iceland and Japan were particularly vocal in
opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure was replaced with a weak recommendation that nations
'consider' an interim prohibition. The New Zealand delegation
worked to slow progress and to ensure that a strong recommendation
for the urgently needed moratorium on high seas bottom trawling did
not come out of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An international alliance of conservation organizations,
including Greenpeace NZ, the national coalition ECO, and Forest and
Bird, has called on governments to impose a moratorium on high seas
bottom trawling until deep-sea life and the sustainability of high
seas bottom fishing have been assessed and legally binding regimes
set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The international community and New Zealand had a real
opportunity to act and they failed," said Greenpeace oceans
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson. "We need immediate action to save the
deep sea from being bulldozed by fishing vessels from a handful of
countries including New Zealand".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO chair, Cath Wallace said "It is extremely disappointing that
New Zealand is not on the side of the environment - the Government
seems to put the very short term interests of a handful of wealthy
fishing companies ahead of the interests of the planet's health and
the long term future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The reason the New Zealand fishing companies are going to the
high seas is that they have already done so much damage to the deep
sea fish stocks and their habitat in New Zealand waters," said
Barry Weeber, Forest and Bird's Senior Researcher. "The destruction
of the deep sea life on the high seas by bottom trawling is a
global problem and it needs a global solution".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions occurred during sessions of the United Nations
Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea
(UNICPOLOS), which annually makes recommendations to the UN General
Assembly for action to protect the world's oceans. The General
Assembly will consider the UNICPOLOS recommendations in November
2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the UNICPOLOS meetings governments from virtually
every region of the world expressed support for a prohibition on
bottom trawling. Particularly strong calls for action to halt
bottom trawling were made by the Norway, Thailand, Costa Rica, the
Republic of Palau, and Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists and more than 1,000 scientists from around the
world are concerned bottom trawlers are increasingly targeting fish
near seamounts, cold water corals and other vulnerable deep sea
habitats in unprotected international waters (2). Scientists say
these largely unexplored habitats are extremely rich in
biodiversity and could be the largest remaining pool of
undiscovered marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is currently in the Tasman Sea documenting
the destruction of deep sea life by bottom trawling. Yesterday,
endangered black coral, a CITES listed species, was dragged up and
a New Zealand bottom trawler hauled onboard a large rock. "This
proves that bottom trawlers including New Zealand fishers do hit
the sea floor damaging the unique and vulnerable life of the deep
sea," concluded Ms Atkinson. Deep sea shark and kina species have
also been caught in the trawl nets.&lt;/p&gt;

	As United Nations delegates (1) stand on the brink of deciding what recommendations are to go to the UN General Assembly on how to protect high seas life, the Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior has documented evidence of the destruction of a CITES listed species through deep sea bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The endangered black coral, a CITES listed species for over 20
years (2), was dragged up from the floor of the Tasman Sea last
night by one of several bottom-trawling vessels operating on the
high seas. Black coral is also protected in adjacent New Zealand
waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is yet further evidence that an immediate moratorium on
high seas bottom trawling is needed to protect the unique
biodiversity of the deep sea", said campaigner Carmen Gravatt from
the Rainbow Warrior. "We are hoping the New Zealand delegation at
the UN will take the opportunity to show some leadership on this as
the meeting finishes their discussions in New York today".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior crew have documented other interesting
species of the deep being discarded as bycatch including deep sea
kina, ghost sharks, and starfish. They also have evidence that will
settle arguments from the fishing industry about bottom
trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Representatives of the bottom trawl industry continue to claim
that bottom trawl nets don't touch the sea bottom - we have solid
evidence this is not true. Yesterday we filmed fishermen wrestling
with a large rock that was brought up in a trawl net on board a New
Zealand bottom trawl vessel. Unless there are mid-water rocks
floating around down there, bottom trawlers - including New Zealand
fishers - do hit the seafloor damaging the unique and vulnerable
life of the deep sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the Minister of Fisheries David Benson-Pope also
acknowledged that bottom trawling did "considerable damage" to deep
sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March this year the Ministry of Fisheries seized New Zealand
bottom trawler, the Seamount Explorer, for allegedly having black
coral in their possession (3). Up to 42 species of black coral
occur in New Zealand waters. Most of these species remain unnamed
and are found in just a few locations - a reminder of still how
little is known about the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) offers important regulatory protection as it is the
foremost international treaty with competency for managing
international trade in species under pressure. Black coral is
listed as an endangered species under Appendix II, the second
highest level of protection. This is reserved for species for which
trade must be controlled to avoid use incompatible with their
survival. This is the same level of international protection given
to Mahogany.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace International senior scientist Pat Costner supports the Ministry for the Environment's (MFE) proposed ban on high temperature hazardous waste incineration but believes it doesn't go far enough.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is a great first step for the NZ Government to take, but
it's just the beginning. Theres a real opportunity for NZ to be at
the forefront of international moves to ban this dangerous and
outdated technology" said Ms Costner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All incineration releases dangerous dioxins. Dioxins cause
cancers, birth defects and endometriosis. The Government must go
further and ban all incineration including phasing out the
dinosaurs that are currently polluting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banning this obsolete technology will go a long way to
protecting the health of New Zealand, now and for future
generations" said Ms Costner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incineration excluded from the proposed ban includes school and
municipal waste, including waste to energy electricity generation.
Greenpeace believes burning school waste and municipal waste must
be quickly phased out and non-toxic alternatives sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 20 years of working on this issue Ms Costner is considered
an international expert on incineration, dioxin sources and
non-incineration technologies for waste disposal and
destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed the Fisheries Minister's acknowledgement that bottom trawling damages deep sea life and that marine biodiversity needs to be protected. However a piece-meal approach to the biggest threat to deep sea life just won't work and anything less than a UN moratorium on high seas bottom trawling will allow the damage to continue.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Minister has not stated how he plans to address this
important issue. He alluded to talks between the New Zealand and
Australian Governments to 'up the levels of biodiversity
protection' (1). Greenpeace is concerned that this is in reference
to ongoing discussions between the two countries to develop joint
conservation measures such as a Marine Protected Area in
international waters in the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While a Marine Protected Area in the Tasman Sea would be an
important step to conserve marine life, it does not protect the
high seas from its biggest threat to deep sea life - bottom
trawling. However a marine protected area in a small part of the
high seas or similar measures is like trying to fix a broken leg
with a bandaid. This is a global problem and we need global action
to address it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Scientists say that bottom trawling is now the single biggest
threat to deep sea life. Greenpeace welcomes the Minister's
comments today and is glad that the New Zealand Government accepts
that bottom trawling is damaging deep sea life," said oceans
campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a welcome addition to the debate which has so far been
dominated by the fishing industry's 'deny everything' approach when
it comes to impacts of bottom trawling on the diverse marine life
of the deep sea. There's more than just fish in the deep sea, like
2,000 year old coral forests, sharks and giant squid," continued Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be void of life, scientists now estimate between
500,000 to 100,000,000 species live in the deep sea. Many of these
species are situated around underwater features like seamounts,
ridges, plateaus and continental slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 1000 scientists from 69 countries, including New Zealand,
called for a United Nations moratorium in an urgent statement
earlier this year. Greenpeace and an international coalition of
environmental groups are supporting this call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moratorium is not a ban. A moratorium is a "time out" for the
deep sea to give time to assess what is there and the
sustainability of high seas bottom fishing and for legally binding
management regimes to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A moratorium is temporary by definition. Once we know how to
look after the deep sea, fishing could resume if it has been proved
to be sustainable for both the fish targeted and the rest of the
deep sea life," continued Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Zealand Government delegation is currently at a United
Nations meeting in New York where a moratorium is being discussed
(2).&lt;/p&gt;

	The launch of Greenpeace's report last week on Malaysian company Rimbunan Hijau's illegal logging operations in PNG, has erupted into a bitter debate in Australia and PNG, with Australia's Forestry Minister and a former PNG Environment Minister acknowledging the truth behind the report.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While timber company Rimbunan Hijau management and industry
officials attempt to deny Greenpeace claims, Australia's forests
minister, Ian McDonald, issued a statement in which he says he
agrees with Greenpeace, "that one of the world's most important
forests is being destroyed by illegal logging in PNG".(1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given the amount of attention and concern the issue of illegal
logging has generated within the Australian Government and the
region, we are astounded by the silence of the New Zealand
Government," said Grant Rosoman Greenpeace Forest Campaigner.
"Considering the amount of timber imported by New Zealand from PNG
we would have expected immediate action by the Government to stop
illegal timber entering New Zealand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand imports timber from a number of countries suffering
from illegal logging including Indonesia and Malaysia(2), but by
far the greatest amount of timber is coming from PNG," said
Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelations of political patronage by logging companies and
their influence over some PNG Forestry officials has been supported
this week by former Environment Minister in Sir Michael Somare's
PNG Government, Mr. Sasa Zibe. Mr Zibe claims that he was sacked
from his portfolio after trying to stand up to a 'network' of
influence within the government and forestry industry.(3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government harps on about increasing stability
and sustainability in PNG and the region, surely halting the
imports of illegal timber into New Zealand would be a step towards
this goal," said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Greenpeace drew attention to the operations of
Auckland based company, The LumberBank, asking them to verify the
origin of the timber in their yard. The LumberBank is owned by
Rimbunan Hijau and imports timber from Rimbunan Hijau's
controversial PNG operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 5th February Greenpeace activists from the Rainbow
Warrior exposed the loading of suspected illegal plywood in
Indonesia. The area, located on the west side of Tanjung Puting
National Park, Kalimantan, is home to a rapidly diminishing
population of orang-utans. Greenpeace is in the region at the
invitation of national non-profit organisations and the Indonesian
Environment Minister to witness environmental problems facing this
highly sensitive and volatile region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Campaigners onboard the Rainbow Warrior on the high seas in the Tasman Sea have now identified five New Zealand fishing vessels active high seas around 350 miles off the coast of New Zealand on the Northwest Challenger Plateau.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 3 vessels identified yesterday the Rainbow
Warrior has found two more, "Recovery II" and the "Tasman Viking"
both owned by CR and DW Boote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New York today, a Greenpeace intervention was made today
during the UN meeting on oceans issues in New York, regarding the
documentation activities that the Rainbow Warrior has been doing on
the high seas in the Tasman Sea. The intervention was made by Karen
Sacks, a policy advisor for Greenpeace International. This
intervention was made before the fifth vessel was identified this
morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN INTERVENTION TEXT: Further to the footage of the Greenpeace
flagship shown earlier, the Rainbow Warrior has been in the
international waters of the Tasman Sea documenting the activities
of high seas bottom trawlers. In the course of the last 24 hours we
have identified four vessels conducting unregulated high seas
bottom trawling in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we speak, the rich biodiversity of the international area is
being destroyed by unregulated fishing. We have witnessed by catch
in the nets of three vessels which include shark and squid
species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is out on the high seas to document activity
so as to clearly illustrate and highlight to the United Nations,
the need for effective and concerted action by the international
community - an immediate moratorium on high seas bottom trawling,
so as to provide a "time out" during which a comprehensive
scientific assessment can be made and effective legally binding
regimes developed to conserve high seas biological diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit together with landowners from Papua New Guinea (PNG) closed Auckland timber company The LumberBank Ltd - today accusing them of importing timber from illegal operations in PNG and selling it here in NZ.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace shut down the yard and hung a banner that read "Why
is illegal timber from PNG sold in NZ?". Visiting PNG landowner
representatives delivered a copy of the Greenpeace report, "The
Untouchables: Rimbunan Hijau's world of forest crime and political
patronage" and asked The LumberBank to verify the origin of the
timber in their yard. The report documents large-scale illegal and
destructive logging activities in PNG by The LumberBank's parent
company and main timber supplier, Malaysian giant, Rimbunan
Hijau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is a huge question mark over the legality of much of the
timber that leaves my country and we suspect that the LumberBank is
trading in timber from Rimbunan Hijau's illegal operations," said
PNG Landowner Representative Dorothy Tekwie. "Our forests and
livelihoods are disappearing at an alarming rate in defiance of our
national laws and often without the informed consent of the local
landowners like myself."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent official inquiry into the PNG forestry sector looked at
Rimbunan Hijau's two largest logging operations and concluded those
logging permits and subsequent extensions were unlawful. It went on
to call "for a full investigation into the affairs of these
companies"(1). Meanwhile some landowner groups are taking up their
own legal case against the Rimbunan Hijau subsidiary, Wawoi Guavi
Timber Company(2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have come to request that New Zealanders stop buying illegal
wood stolen from our lands. If market countries like New Zealand
place restrictions on illegal timber imports, it will help us to
halt illegal logging on our lands" said Tekwie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand imported approximately 4,600 cubic metres of sawn
timber from PNG in 2003, much of this we suspect is from illegal
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urge the New Zealand Government to immediately place import
restrictions on illegal timber coming into New Zealand and adopt a
strong Government timber purchasing policy, said Greenpeace Forests
Campaigner, Grant Rosoman. "The New Zealand Government is also in a
perfect position to protect forests from illegal logging by taking
a strong stand on law enforcement and management of a global
network of protected areas at the meeting of the Convention on
Biological Diversity next week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."&lt;/p&gt;

	A broad international coalition of environmentalists, The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, today called on the United Nations (UN) to suspend the most destructive fishing practice on the high seas. Bottom trawl fishing in international waters may be wiping out hundreds or even thousands of undiscovered species, says the group. The call came as the Rainbow Warrior reached international waters around New Zealand on its campaign to document bottom trawl destruction.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;According to a study released on the opening day of a key UN
meeting, bottom trawlers are increasingly targeting commercially
valuable fish found near underwater mountains, or seamounts, cold
water corals and other vulnerable deep sea habitats in unprotected
areas of international waters. Scientists believe these largely
unexplored habitats are extremely rich in biodiversity and could be
home to the largest remaining pool of undiscovered marine
species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the new report, Matthew Gianni, visited New
Zealand last month, meeting with Ministers, officials and the
industry to discuss the UN moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push to suspend bottom trawling on the high seas comes as
the United Nations Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the
Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS) gathers oceans, environmental and
fisheries officials from around the world, for a series of meetings
in New York during the week of June 7-11. A New Zealand delegation
is participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition is calling on UNICPOLOS
delegates to back a UN General Assembly resolution for a moratorium
on high seas bottom trawling. This halt would need to stay until
deep sea biodiversity and the sustainability of high seas bottom
fishing have been scientifically assessed and legally binding
regimes have been established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bottom trawling is eliminating entire ecosystems and species,
in some cases before we have even learned of their existence," said
Karen Sack, of Greenpeace International. "In the past fifty years,
we've already wiped out 90% of the top predatory fish species. We
are now flirting with a global catastrophe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans campaigner, Carmen Gravatt on
board the Rainbow Warrior expressed her support for the meeting in
New York. "While you continue to negotiate, we will continue to
sail the high seas to expose the needless destruction. I hope our
joint efforts will persuade policy makers to take the steps needed
to protect deep sea life before it is too late," stated Gravatt
during a live link up to the UN meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling plows up the ocean floor, destroying everything
in its path, including fragile corals, sponges and other deep-sea
habitats. Underwater surveys have shown that up to 95% of
deep-water coral reefs on seamounts can be destroyed by bottom
trawl fishing. Video images of impacted areas and new scientific
evidence on the age and slow growth rate of corals demonstrate
ecosystems that are sometimes hundreds or thousands of years old
are usually damaged beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The deep seas are our planet's last frontier," said Matthew
Gianni, the study's author and a former fisherman turned
conservation expert. "The least-explored habitats on Earth aren't
the Andes or the remote tropical rain forests of Asia they're
seamounts, deep sea corals, hydrothermal vents and other deep ocean
features that are teeming with unique and important marine life.
These areas must be protected before they are lost."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gianni report emphasizes that a small group of countries are
destroying the biodiversity of the global oceans commons for
relatively insignificant economic gain. The report identifies
eleven countries-Spain, Russia, Portugal, Norway, Estonia,
Denmark/Faeroe Islands, Japan, Lithuania, Iceland, New Zealand and
Latvia - as taking 95% of the fish caught in bottom trawl fisheries
on the high seas in 2001. Of these, European Union countries
(including Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) took approximately 60%
of the catch. Spain alone accounted for 40% of the overall global
high seas bottom trawl catch in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceans campaigner, Carmen Gravatt, on board the Rainbow Warrior
pointed out that the high seas is the responsibility of everyone,
"It is the duty of ALL nations to conserve the enormous
biodiversity of the deep sea and its wealth of species some of
which are yet to be identified or described. Also, it is the duty
of ALL nations to work together to protect these common
resources."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has called on John Howard, Helen Clark and Pacific leaders - meeting in Auckland today - not to ignore illegal logging and its corrupt trade, when discussing regional security and a vision for the Pacific in the 21st Century.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is meeting to discuss security
in the region whilst member countries are involved in the illegal
trade of the Pacific's ancient forests. The forest sector is a
major driver of political corruption, environmental destruction and
social instability in some Pacific countries. "Whilst the left hand
makes efforts towards good governance, the right hand undermines it
by supporting the industrial logging industry", said Grant Rosoman,
Greenpeace Forests Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The most important forests in the region are being destroyed
despite the opposition of the landowners who own them. This
continues thanks to corruption in Pacific nations and to the
inaction of importing countries like New Zealand and Australia."
Said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace hosted a visit by Papua New Guinean landowners to New
Zealand this February, when they asked the government for tougher
measures to prevent the import and sale of illegal timber from
their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Australia and New Zealand currently import illegal timber
from their Pacific neighbours, in particular, Papua New Guinea.
Prime Ministers Howard and Clark have an opportunity to lead by
example in the Pacific by halting their involvement in this
destructive trade. "If these leaders are serious about true
security in the Pacific they could demonstrate this by stopping the
import of timber produced in violation of the laws of other Pacific
nations", concluded Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace recommends that Pacific leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· develop timber procurement policies that ensure timber
products can be verified as coming from sustainably managed
forests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· immediately place import restrictions on illegal wood; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· link foreign aid to measures that will have a direct impact on
the reform of the forest industry and support community controlled
sustainable economic initiatives such as eco-forestry.&lt;/p&gt;

	At a United Nations (UN) reception in New York on Wednesday night, attended by around 70 UN delegates, we got busy with the photocopier and made sure that the opinions of our supporters were visible from the front door to the buffet table.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Our International Policy Advisor, Karen Sack, gave a rousing
speech as she then presented the 6000 strong petition to the UN
delegates. "They are not scientists, nor specialists," she said of
our cyberactivists, "but they are citizens of every nation
represented here tonight, and they too want their voice heard
inside the UN."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Their messages bring real clarity to this issue, they
understand it is not about food for our tables, it is not about
fishing quotas, they understand it is about needless destruction of
one of the least protected part of our planet and it is wrong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document, containing key quotes and messages of support,
will be given to the co-chairs of the current UN meeting on Oceans
issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also presented a video showing the devastation caused by
bottom trawling and clips beamed straight from our activists on the
Rainbow Warrior as they expose the unregulated fishing taking place
on the high seas off the coast of New Zealand. One UN official saw
the video and said, "You've just reminded me why I'm here".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while there are some warm and fuzzy moments to celebrate,
there is still a lot of work to do. The Rainbow Warrior is
uncovering more damning evidence from the Tasman Sea. Yesterday
Rainbow Warrior crew members completed a James Bond-like night
mission armed with infrared cameras to document yet another bottom
trawler on the high seas. Meanwhile, international and media
pressure is building on governments and the UN to support the
moratorium on bottom trawling. The New Zealand Fisheries Minister
yesterday acknowledged that marine biodiversity does need to be
protected. However he did not state exactly how and we suspect that
he is trying for a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A marine protected area in a small part of the high seas or
similar measures is like trying to fix a broken leg with a bandaid.
This is a global problem and we need global action to address it,"
said our Oceans campaigner Vanessa Atkinson from New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saga continues ...&lt;/p&gt;

	Ronald McDonald entered the Queen Street branch of McDonalds today and handed in his resignation. The dramatic action was taken by the infamous fast food clown in protest at McDonalds use of chicken fed on genetically engineered (GE) soy meal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I'm so upset to learn that stores named after me are using GE
fed chicken," said Ronald. The icon red and yellow character was
encouraging McDonalds customers at the Queen Street store to send
messages demanding that the fast food chain stop using GE chicken
feed and commit to a non-GE poultry, egg and ingredient supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Steve Abel commended Ronald's protest
actions. "It seems like a bit of fun but it's actually a serious
issue," said Abel. Imported GE soy feed is the biggest source of GE
contamination in the New Zealand food chain. McDonalds chicken is
supplied by Australian poultry giant Inghams who bring in around
50,000 tonnes of GE contaminated soy annually (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr McDonald was accompanied by a flock of indignant chickens
wearing bibs with the message "Say NO to McGE - GE fed chicken."
The poultry protesters handed out mock 'happy meal' packs with
crayons, stickers and colour-in postcards for customers to send to
the fast food giant demanding they make the shift to non-GE
feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"McDonalds and Inghams should stop using GE ingredients and feed
out of a commitment to customer preference (2), concerns about
potential health impacts and for the good of the environment," said
Abel. "GE soy production in the US and Argentina has led to
increased chemical use, lower yields, herbicide resistant weeds and
contamination of conventional crops." McDonalds already has a
Europe wide policy of excluding GE in food and poultry feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace New Zealand activity is part of a global
stepping-up of the international environmental group's campaign
against the spread of GE crops, which includes ongoing mobilisation
of consumers against GE food. Soy is the most widely grown GE crop.
Over 80% of GE crops are used for animal feed and nearly half the
world's soy is now genetically engineered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is clearly an urgent need to stop GE soy," said Steve
Abel. "At every opportunity, Greenpeace will confront GE soy, be it
along export routes or in the food chain. In Brazil, we are at the
forefront of the battle against GE soy, and in China we are working
to protect the homeland of soy from genetic contamination."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior, currently in Australia,
is due to arrive in New Zealand on May 12 for the New Zealand leg
of its GE Free trans-Tasman tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Roundup Ready soy DNA content, in relation to the total soy
DNA of this [Inghams] sample, is 85% (+/-10%), AgriQuality, 10 June
2003. Full results can be viewed at:
www.greenpeace.org.nz/campaigns/ge (2) Independent research done
for Tegel found that 75% of consumers wanted chickens that had not
been fed GE soy meal, NZ Herald, 29 August 2001. Tegel, New
Zealand's largest poultry company, have an active non-GE feed
policy and import certified non-GE feed from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please Note: Ingham claim that their next shipment of soy meal
into New Zealand, due in June, is non-GE soy from Brazil. However,
according to Ingham, the shipment is not certified as non-GE so it
could be significantly GE contaminated. Inghams also have no
commitment to sourcing non-GE soy now or into the future. This
unverified shipment cannot legitimately be used to claim a non-GE
policy by Inghams or McDonalds.&lt;/p&gt;

	The role of the New Zealand bottom trawl industry on the high seas will come under close scrutiny in New York, after Greenpeace discovered three New Zealand bottom trawlers fishing on the high seas yesterday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior located the Amaltal Voyager, Westbay, and
Corsair around 350 miles off the coast of New Zealand on the
Northwest Challenger Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Greenpeace activists documented the fishing activities on
the high seas, a Greenpeace delegation began talks at the United
Nations to secure a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.
(1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner, Carmen Gravatt, aboard the Rainbow
Warrior acknowledged the pressure the New Zealand Government would
now be under. "The New Zealand Government has yet to say whether it
will support or oppose a moratorium but they must be feeling the
heat in New York at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unregulated high seas bottom trawling is destroying the rich
biodiversity of the deep sea. These vessels are fishing without
regard for the consequences of their actions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace pointed out that one of the fishing boats fishing on
the high seas was the Amaltal Fishing Company, which is a
shareholder of the Orange Roughy Management Company (ORMC). Early
last week, George Clements, the Chief Executive of the ORMC denied
on a Radio New Zealand interview that any of its members operated
in international waters. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a thousand scientists are supporting the call for a
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling, because of the vast amount
of marine life that is destroyed by this fishing technique. Many
species have not even been described or discovered before they are
fished out, while ancient corals and sponges are decimated, with
little chance of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are only a small number of nations responsible for this
environmental devastation," said Karen Sack, Greenpeace
International Oceans Policy Advisor, at the United Nations. "While
they reap rich rewards, the biodiversity of the least protected
area of this planet is being wiped out. That is why the United
Nations must impose an immediate moratorium on bottom
trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

	Buenos Aires: New visual evidence of the impacts of climate change was released by Greenpeace in Patagonia today. Dramatic new photos of Patagonian glaciers taken by the research team on board the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise show the extent to which climate change has caused the ice to melt this century, when compared to photos of the same glaciers taken in 1928.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt all over the
world. In Patagonia, they are disappearing at a rate of 42 cubic
kilometres every year faster than anywhere else on Earth", said
Greenpeace campaigner Vanessa Atkinson. New Zealand glaciers are
also in an overall pattern of retreat. Climate change is the
trigger and the reason behind the speed at which glaciers are
retreating." Greenpeace has been touring Patagonia and Chile for 4
weeks. The research team's findings confirm that a number of large
glaciers, such as the San Quintin and Upsala glaciers, part of the
Northern and Southern Patagonian ice-fields, have significantly
thinned and have retreated several kilometres in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1995 through 2000 the rate of ice loss from the Patagonian
ice fields has more than doubled, to an equivalent sea level rise
of 0.1 mm (0.004 inches) per year. The sheer volume of melt water
from glaciers is causing the sea levels to rise (1), increasing the
risk of flooding in many of the world's coastal areas. It is also
starting to cause problems for people who depend on the glaciers
for their fresh water supply. This may cause enormous problems in
the future given that a third of the world's population - 2 billion
people rely on rivers fed by Himalayan glaciers alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change is a global problem - not only do we risk losing
the world's glaciers but we are already witnessing increased
frequency and severity of floods (2) and droughts, loss of coral
reefs, sea level rise and a rapid spread of diseases such as
malaria," added Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clean renewable energy is key to addressing climate change,"
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy technologies and industries are poised on the
brink of a revolution all they need is political support. World
leaders are being invited for the first time to attend an
international renewables conference, to be held in Bonn (June 1 to
4, 2004 ). Greenpeace is calling on Helen Clark to attend to this
conference and for world leaders to adopt firm commitments to
provide a minimum to 20 % of global power from clean sources by
2020.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the eve of the 15th anniversary of the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill, which saw 11 million gallons of oil being spilled into a pristine wilderness area in Alaska, Greenpeace demands that US oil giant ExxonMobil comes clean about the true state of Prince William Sound, the site of the spill.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In 1991 ExxonMobil pleaded guilty to breaking several
environmental laws and settled criminal and civil lawsuits of over
1 billion USD (1.69 billion NZ). This was the most extensive
attempt in human history to mitigate the environmental damage
caused by an industrial disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then ExxonMobil, the worlds oldest oil company, has used
its vast financial power and influence to avoid taking
responsibility, but should be held to account. The company has
dragged out the battle over the additional 5 billion USD (8.45
billion NZ) punitive damages awarded against it and has stated that
it intends to see the decision "overturned." [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ExxonMobil dodges responsibility for massive ecological
damage in an Alaskan wilderness, the company is proceeding to use
the courts to press felony charges against 38 Greenpeace volunteers
who entered the companies headquarters in Texas to conduct a
peaceful protest against the companies position on climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, ExxonMobil funded research that claimed the
Sound was well on its way to recovery. But new scientific research,
conducted over the last 14 years, states the opposite. The latest
study, published in SCIENCE magazine [2] concluded that far from
having recovered the Sound area continues to experience problems as
a result of oil remaining from the spill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 500 miles of the coastline covered in oil just within the
Sound area, mortality in the aftermath of the spill was
particularly high, with sea otter, sea bird and harbour seal
populations suffering the most. Contrary to ExxonMobil's research,
oil is still present in the Sound and has remained 'persistently
toxic', resulting in long-term impacts in fish, sea otters and sea
ducks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennis Kelso, Commissioner of Alaska's Department of
Environmental Conservation argues that ExxonMobil's statements
following the spill were "part of a deliberate misinformation
campaign," [3] a position supported by marine scientist Professor
Rick Steiner, who believes that ExxonMobil "has constructed its own
"reality" of the spill - minimal impacts and rapid recovery."
[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil's tactics are well-known, and this is a classic case
of deny, dupe and delay," said Greenpeace Campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson. "Just as it denies the science on climate change, it
denies that oil from the spill is causing damage in the Sound. And
on both issues it is running campaigns to dupe the public into
thinking it is an environmentally and socially responsible
corporation. As long as ExxonMobil continues this way, Greenpeace
will continue to campaign like the volunteers in Texas, to expose
it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobils version of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is a history
of lies, a legacy that the company pursues today in its attempts to
demolish accepted science on climate change. At a time when the
world is suffering the consequences of changing weather, droughts
and floods ExxonMobil argues that more research is needed before
taking action.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today criticised the ongoing failure of Federated Farmers to offer a balance of views on genetic engineering (GE) by their plans to host and promote a pro-GE crop advocate in Ashburton this Friday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mr Gregory Conko is scheduled to speak, along with Dr Richard
Foster, at a number of events in the coming few days including a
Federated Farmers Grains Council meeting in Ashburton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This American fellow Conko is a hard line GE advocate yet he is
being billed by Fed Farmers as someone with a balanced view on
biotechnology," commented Greenpeace GE spokesperson Steve Abel.
"Conko is expert at regurgitating the same sort of pro-GE Public
Relations spin as the worlds biggest GE seed producer Monsanto who,
not surprisingly, feature him on their website," [1] says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conko advocates removing restrictions on GE crop growing and
constantly utters spin, scientific inaccuracies and outright lies
about GE crops, such as; "In the USA...the commercial cultivation
of GM crops has reduced insecticide and herbicide use," "The use of
bioengineering technology for the development of new plant
varieties...has increased crop yields and food production," and
"Genetic modification can offer tremendous benefits for the
environment, for farmers and for consumers - but only if we give it
a chance to prove itself."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the majority of GE acreage yields less than conventional
equivalents according to analysis of United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) figures [2]. Also according to USDA figures, GE
crops have led to a massive increase in herbicide use in the US [3]
and a number of other problems such as superweeds with multiple
herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seven years of GE production many North American farmers
and farmer bodies such as the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) are
strongly opposing the release of GE wheat. The CWB, as the biggest
marketer of wheat and barley in the world, oppose GE wheat exactly
because they see it as harming their industry on the basis of their
experiences with other GE crops. [4] Consumers the world-over are
well aware that GE crops offer them no benefits and continue to
demand GE free foods. GE has been given a huge 'chance´ in the US
and has proved itself an environmental, public, commercial and
agronomic failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would advise that people avoid Mr Conko but those who do find
themselves in earshot of him should be aware that he certainly does
not offer accurate information or represent a balanced view on GE
crops," concluded Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Seeds with Monsanto traits accounted for 91% of the total
global area sown to GE crops in 2002. Monsanto feature a pro-GE
Conko article on their website:&lt;/p&gt;

	For the second day in a row, Greenpeace has disrupted a New Zealand bottom trawler in international waters. Bottom trawling the sea floor is the biggest threat to life in the deep sea, and every trawl does incredible damage.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Using the Rainbow Warrior and inflatable boats, activists
successfully stopped four trawls by the vessel, the Ocean Reward in
the international waters of the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists first used a cable to connect the vessel's
several-tonne trawl doors together, choking off the net and
preventing it from being deployed. Hung from the cables were signs
reading 'End Deep Sea Destruction'. Later, floating barrels reading
'Protect Deep Sea Life' were repeatedly attached to the net,
forcing the vessel to haul the net back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is taking action today because government's are
failing to end the destruction," said Greenpeace oceans campaigner,
Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than four percent of the deep sea is rocky areas such as
seamounts, ridges and plateaus. It is these few areas that hold
some of the largest diversity of species and undiscovered life on
earth. Unfortunately, this also means these areas are also the
prime target for bottom trawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the moment it's a race against time as bottom trawlers wipe
out life in the deep sea before we even know what's down there.
Every trawl we stop could save a coral forest that took hundreds of
years to grow. We urgently need a moratorium on bottom trawling in
international waters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we did our best to stop the destruction by a bottom
trawler today, the only way to protect deep sea life for the future
is for governments to act."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before taking action, the Rainbow Warrior informed the skipper
of the Ocean Reward that Greenpeace were undertaking a peaceful
protest and did not intend to interfere with their navigation,
endanger their crew or damage equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	After two successful days disrupting destructive bottom trawling, the Rainbow Warrior has headed off to find bottom trawlers from other nations, including Australia. The Rainbow Warrior had already steamed away from the Ocean Reward on its mission when Greenpeace received notice that Amaltal was going to apply for an injunction.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The fact that companies like Amaltal are allowed to continue
destroying our global marine heritage and wipe undiscovered species
off the face of the planet, is completely outrageous. This
highlights the urgent need for the international community to take
action to protect deep sea life so that we don't have to," said
Greenpeace campaigner, Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is not the only country involved in bottom trawling
in international waters. We are now taking the Rainbow Warrior
further out into the high seas to look for other vessels to show
the world the range of countries involved in deep sea destruction.
The New Zealand vessel, the Ocean Reward, is fishing in an area
where there is no fisheries management agreements in place and
where we know that New Zealand-flagged vessels have in the past
fished alongside vessel under flags of convenience," said
Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, fishing industry voices attempted to defend the
world's most destructive fishing practise by claiming innocence for
their weighted bottom trawl nets, saying they had little
impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry is being dishonest in its defence of bottom
trawling. Bottom trawling is now considered by marine scientists to
be the biggest threat to deep sea biodiversity and the UN last year
called on States to take urgent action to address the impacts of
destructive fishing such as bottom trawling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January this year the report of the Millennium Project's Task
Force on Environmental Sustainability - a UN Advisory group looking
at how to achieve the Millennium Development Goals - recommends
that "global fisheries authorities must agree to eliminate bottom
trawling on the high seas by 2006 to protect seamounts and other
ecologically sensitive habitats and to eliminate bottom trawling
globally by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the UN is discussing how to manage the world's oceans
at a meeting in New York, and it is at this global level that we
need action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The writing is on the wall, the science is leading the charge
and grabbing at legal tactics will not change the fact that the
days of high seas bottom trawling are numbered", concluded
Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*In fisheries for species such as orange roughy, which aggregate
above seamounts, don't properly deployed bottom trawl nets only
skims just above the seafloor to avoid damaging fishing gear?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This claim is directly refuted by scientific studies that
document high coral bycatch rates in orange roughy fisheries. In
the first year of the orange roughy fishery on the Tasmanian Rise
off New Zealand, observers estimated that 1.6 tons of coral were
caught each hour, with over 10,000 tons of coral estimated to be
caught in just one year. The tendency of schools of orange roughy
to swim downward away from predators and fishing nets also
increases the chance of net contact with the bottom as the net is
further lowered to catch fish. If it were possible to avoid the
bottom, fishermen would have no objection to eliminating rollers,
rockhoppers, "canyon busters", and other gear which is specifically
designed to enable contact with the seabed. But even if it were
possible to completely avoid the bottom, there is no means of
effectively enforcing such a practice on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Seafood Industry Council say Greenpeace have reported New
Zealand bottom trawlers as being "good operators", is this
true?*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SeaFIC has completely taken the quote out of context and
misrepresented our words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Is Greenpeace anti-fishing?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. We want people fishing for their livelihoods in hundreds of
years time. The only way that will happen is if the industry is
environmentally sustainable. But the very nature of bottom trawling
means this is very unlikely. The collapse of the Atlantic Cod
fishery of New Foundland in 1992 was because industrial bottom
trawlers took too many fish and destroyed their habitat. Bottom
trawling is the most destructive method of fishing in the world.
That's why government's need to act to put in place a moratorium on
bottom trawling in international waters, to give scientists time to
study deep sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken action because the world's governments are failing
to end the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Has Amaltal threatened Greenpeace.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The over-reaction from Talley's is just further proof that the
fishing industry know that there are big problems with bottom
trawling. They clearly don't want everyone to see just how
unsustainable bottom trawling is - which is why the Rainbow Warrior
is out here now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about Talley's or the NZ fishing industry, it's
about the destruction wreaked by bottom trawling on deep sea life
and how governments worldwide are failing to protect the unknown
worlds of the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the first day of United Nations' discussions on how to manage the Earth's oceans, Greenpeace has taken action against a vessel using the most destructive fishing method in the world, bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Using the Rainbow Warrior and inflatable boats, Greenpeace
activists disrupted the New Zealand vessel, the Ocean Reward, from
destroying deep-sea life while bottom trawling in international
waters of the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists delayed the vessel from deploying its net by attaching
an inflatable life-raft, despite being shot at with compressed air
guns and sprayed with high pressure fire hoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling nets are dragged along the sea floor. Huge
chains or rollers attached to the front of the nets destroy
everything in the their path, including coral forests, as well as
sponges, worm tubes, mussels, boulder fields, and rocky reefs. Huge
numbers of non-target fish and other deep sea creatures are
unintentionally caught as well. Then they are dumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This type of fishing is considered by scientists to be the
greatest threat to deep sea biodiversity and every trawl does
incredible damage," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace New Zealand
campaigner on board the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A global moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters
is urgently needed to protect life in the deep sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the sixth meeting of the United Nations Informal
Consultation on Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS) gets
underway at the United Nations in New York. The focus of the
meeting is on sustainable fisheries and it is expected that the
demand for a UN moratorium on high seas bottom trawling will be
again be on the table for discussion. There is a growing number of
countries that are moving to support this as the only responsible
action to provide immediate protection for deep sea
biodiversity.(1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Greenpeace documented bottom trawlers hauling up sea
stars, rocks and even endangered black coral, despite fishing
industry claims that their bottom trawling vessels did not touch
the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is taking action against bottom trawling in
international waters because governments have failed to establish a
moratorium to stop the destruction," said Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every trawl we disrupt, we could be saving coral forests that
took hundreds of years to grow."&lt;/p&gt;

	In the lead up to the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, Greenpeace's flagship vessel leaves today for international waters around New Zealand to highlight the destructive impacts of bottom trawling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Bottom trawling is the most destructive fishing practice in the
world," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace Oceans campaigner, at a
press conference on board the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour.
"The deep sea is the largest pool of undiscovered life on Earth.
Bottom trawling these unknown worlds is like blowing up Mars before
we get there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Rainbow Warrior sailed to the Tasman Sea last year, the
crew documented New Zealand and Belizean bottom trawlers hauling in
huge amounts of by-catch, rocks from the sea floor and bottom
dwelling marine life, including endangered black coral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, scientists and environmental groups are
calling for a United Nations moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling. The Rainbow Warrior will head out to international waters
around New Zealand again to underline the lack of government action
in the face of the urgent threat that bottom trawling poses to deep
sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Each day bottom trawling continues, more deep sea life gets
wiped out and the situation becomes more critical," said
Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters is
urgently needed to protect life in the deep sea and New Zealand and
Australian Governments should be joining other states in leading
the global push for one at the UN."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since last year, the New Zealand and Australian Governments
have only made statements about establishing a regional fishing
agreement. But they have been talking about ways to manage the
Tasman Sea for 15 years already and so far failed to come up with
any effective biodiversity protection. By the time they sign any
agreements, it will be too late."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand and Australian Governments are risking their
international reputations and contributing to the destruction of
ancient ecosystems we know little about, for the sake of a few
fish."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Willcox, captain of the first Rainbow Warrior when it was
bombed, will be skippering the ship again during this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The bombing of the first Rainbow Warrior was a terrible
tragedy, but there could not be a better way to commemorate the
event than to continue challenging the big environmental issues of
today such as bottom trawling in international waters," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;

	July 10, 2005 marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of The Rainbow Warrior in Auckland and in recognition a remarkable recording of The Muttonbirds' 'Anchor Me' will be released on July the 4th, with proceeds to Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented recording features vocals from Goldenhorse's
Kirsten Morelle, Che Fu, Anika Moa, Pluto's Milan Borich, Adeaze,
Hinewehi Mohi and Nesian Mystik's David Atai &amp;amp; Donald
McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Anchor Me' composer Don McGlashan said "when Greenpeace asked
to use 'Anchor Me' to mark twenty years since the Rainbow Warrior's
sinking, I was glad to help. Our country's response to the bombing
was brave and steadfast - and it succeeded on many levels. We still
lead the world's resistance to nuclear weapons, and that's
something to be very proud of."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All artists and musicians, in fact everyone involved, donated
their time for free. "We've been overwhelmed by the amount of
support we've received," said Greenpeace Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"An impressive team of people have come together to donate their
time, resources and expertise not only to commemorate the tragic
events of July 10, but also to celebrate New Zealand being nuclear
free and to support the vision of a peaceful and environmentally
sound planet which the Rainbow Warrior continues to work for and
symbolise," says Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greenpeace concert will also take place July 10 in Auckland,
details of which will be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Anchor Me', the Rainbow Warrior commemoration will be serviced
to radio nationwide on June 6. A video for the song is in
production and will be available from June 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to: Don McGlashan, York St, The Lab, Murray
Grindlay, Flying Fish, Publicis Mojo and FMR.&lt;/p&gt;

	Last night's announcement by the Minister for the Environment that the Stockholm Convention on deadly poisons will come into force in May is welcomed by Greenpeace New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"If implemented properly, the Stockholm Convention - which aims
to eliminate poisons that lead to cancers and reproductive
disorders - will have a beneficial impact on our environment and
everybody living in New Zealand", said Greenpeace toxics
campaigner, Mere Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand was notably absent from the first fifty parties to
the Convention however, they intend to ratify before May. While New
Zealand has appropriate bans on many of the 12 Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs), they are yet to put in place a plan for the
elimination of dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace welcomes the New Zealand Government's imminent
ratification of the Stockholm Convention. However the Government
must not sidestep the Convention's ultimate aim of eliminating
dioxins. There is no proven safe level of dioxins", said Ms
Takoko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The entry into force of the Stockholm Convention is a testimony
to decades of pressure by environmental, indigenous and health
organizations to ensure governments and chemical industries address
these deadly chemicals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins are extremely toxic chemicals that persist in our bodies
and the environment for long periods of time. They are known to
cause cancer, birth defects and endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty has the ultimate aim of elimination of 12 of the
worst POPs.&lt;/p&gt;

	As Greenpeace made its submission to the Environment Court today in support of the Awhitu wind farm proposed at Waiuku, it also welcomed a report released today by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority demonstrating the huge wind energy resource waiting to be used in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This report should put an end to the concerted public relations
campaign by the likes of the coal industry that wind could only
play a small role in our electricity system. New Zealand has been
described as the 'Saudi Arabia of wind' and we must now move
forward to fulfil this potential," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With today's technology, 35% of our electricity capacity could
come from wind within ten years. Greenpeace considers this could be
even higher with technological advances" she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wind energy has a huge role to play in our energy future and in
combating climate change. It is already the fastest growing energy
sector in the world. New Zealand must encourage and support wind
farm developments as they are proposed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has joined the appeals made by Genesis and the Energy
Efficiency and Conservation Authority, on a decision by Franklin
District Council to turn down a wind farm application by Genesis in
Waiuku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many groups have also joined the appeals in support of the wind
farm including Auckland Regional Council, Mighty River Power, The
New Zealand Wind Energy Association and the Environmental Defence
Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franklin District Council has now pulled out of the appeal
process, despite being the consent authority who made the decision
originally, saying that "the Council resolved not to oppose
granting of the resource consent".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace joined the appeal as we are very concerned about
climate change - the biggest environmental threat our planet faces.
Wind and other forms of renewable energy are vital in addressing
climate change. We consider this to be a precedent-setting case
which could affect future windfarm developments in New Zealand,
particularly in coastal areas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, through its lawyer Duncan Currie, is due to make its
submission to the Environment Court today.&lt;/p&gt;

	Over 1000 of the world's foremost marine scientists - including New Zealand scientists(1) - released a strong statement today calling on governments and the UN to protect threatened deep sea ecosystems by establishing a moratorium on the most destructive fishing method: Bottom trawling on the High Seas(2).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The statement was released simultaneously at the meeting of the
UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have recently discovered undersea coral forests and
reefs scattered throughout the cold and deep ocean waters of the
world. Some corals resemble "trees" up to 10 meters tall. Hundreds
and sometimes thousands of species live in these cold-water coral
forests and reefs, leading scientists to call them the "rainforests
of the deep." But even before scientists can find them, deep-sea
coral ecosystems are being destroyed by commercial fishing,
especially bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bottom-trawling in the deep-sea is like clear-cutting a
pristine ancient forest. Each trawl destroys everything in its
path. In the interest of catching a few fish, hundreds of species
-some of which have not even been identified - are destroyed," said
Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-sea bottom trawlers are fishing vessels that drag huge nets
with steel weights or heavy rollers along the seafloor to catch
Deep Water fish species. The trawls smash corals and sponges and
rip them from the seafloor. New Zealand has one of the largest
deep-water bottom trawl fishing fleets in the world. The New
Zealand government has recently taken steps to protect 19 areas
within their Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) from bottom trawl
fishing but that move is being challenged by the Orange Roughy
Management Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scientists urge the UN to establish a moratorium on bottom
trawling on the High Seas. They also call on nations and states to
ban bottom trawling to protect deep-sea ecosystems wherever coral
forests and reefs are known to occur within their EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Governments at the Convention on Biological Diversity must pass
a resolution recommending that the United Nations General Assembly
adopt an immediate moratorium on high seas bottom trawling and put
an immediate halt to this destructive activity," said Thilo Maack
of Greenpeace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliations are for identification only, and do not imply
endorsement by the signers' institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As marine scientists and conservation biologists, we are
profoundly concerned that human activities, particularly bottom
trawling, are causing unprecedented damage to the deep-sea coral
and sponge communities on continental plateaus and slopes, and on
seamounts and mid-ocean ridges. Shallow-water coral reefs are
sometimes called "the rainforests of the sea" for their
extraordinary biological diversity, perhaps the highest anywhere on
Earth. However, until quite recently, few people - even marine
scientists - knew that the majority of coral species live in
colder, darker depths, or that some of these form coral reefs and
forests similar to those of shallow waters in appearance, species
richness and importance to fisheries. Lophelia coral reefs in cold
waters of the Northeast Atlantic have over 1,300 species of
invertebrates, and over 850 species of macro- and megafauna were
recently found on seamounts in the Tasman and Coral Seas, as many
as in a shallow-water coral reef. Because seamounts are essentially
undersea islands, many seamount species are endemics -species that
occur nowhere else - and are therefore exceptionally vulnerable to
extinction. Moreover, marine scientists have observed large numbers
of commercially important but increasingly uncommon groupers and
redfish among the sheltering structures of deep-sea coral reefs.
Finally, because of their longevity, some deep-sea corals can serve
as archives of past climate conditions that are important to
understanding global climate change. In short, based on current
knowledge, deep-sea coral and sponge communities appear to be as
important to the biodiversity of the oceans and the sustainability
of fisheries as their analogues in shallow tropical seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years scientists have discovered deep-sea corals
and/or coral reefs in Japan, Tasmania, New Zealand, Alaska,
California, Nova Scotia, Maine, North Carolina, Florida, Colombia,
Brazil, Norway, Sweden, UK, Ireland and Mauritania. Because
research submarines and remotely operated vehicles suitable for
studying the deep sea are few and expensive to operate, scientific
investigation of these remarkable communities is in its very early
stages. But it is increasingly clear that deep-sea corals usually
inhabit places where natural disturbance is rare, and where growth
and reproduction appear to be exceedingly slow. Deep-sea corals and
sponges may live for centuries, making them and the myriad species
that depend on them extremely slow to recover from disturbance.
Unfortunately, just as scientists have begun to understand the
diversity, importance and vulnerability of deep-sea coral forests
and reefs, humans have developed technologies that profoundly
disturb them. There is reason for concern about deep-sea oil and
gas development, deep-sea mining and global warming, but, at
present, the greatest human threat to coral and sponge communities
is commercial fishing, especially bottom trawling. Trawlers are
vessels that drag large, heavily weighted nets across the seafloor
to catch fishes and shrimps. Scientific studies around the world
have shown that trawling is devastating to corals and sponges. As
trawlers become more technologically sophisticated, and as fishes
disappear from shallower areas, trawling is increasingly occurring
at depths exceeding 1,000 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not too late to save most of the world's deep-sea coral
and sponge ecosystems. We commend nations including Australia, New
Zealand, Canada and Norway, which have already taken initial steps
towards protecting some coral and sponge ecosystems under their
jurisdiction. We urge the United Nations and appropriate
international bodies to establish a moratorium on bottom trawling
on the High Seas. Similarly, we urge individual nations and states
to ban bottom trawling to protect deep-sea ecosystems wherever
coral forests and reefs are known to occur within their Exclusive
Economic Zones. We urge them to prohibit roller and rockhopper
trawls and any similar technologies that allow fishermen to trawl
on the rough bottoms where deep-sea coral and sponge communities
are most likely to occur. We urge them to support research and
mapping of vulnerable deep-sea coral and sponge communities. And we
urge them to establish effective, representative networks of marine
protected areas that include deep-sea coral and sponge
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two "fast-spin" green-washing machines and a clothesline of green T-shirts emblazoned 'Coal', 'Mercury', 'Arsenic' and 'Climate Change' greeted the head of Mighty River Power (MRP) as he entered the Sustainability Conference at the Stamford Plaza in Auckland to welcome delegates. A banner reading "Mighty River Power's Greenwash Laundry" clarified the scene.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace protesters and local Ruakaka residents who would be
affected by the proposed Marsden B coal-fired power station that
MRP are pushing as "sustainable", handed out leaflets which mocked
MRP's claims to sustainability to delegates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We think Mighty River Power has sponsored to the wrong
conference," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.
"This is a gathering of industries that are meant to be advancing
their sustainability programmes but MRP is going backwards fast
with their plans to build NZ's first coal fired power station in 25
years."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRP has sought consent to discharge a raft of toxic chemicals
into the environment around Ruakaka and Bream Bay near Whangarei in
the course of running Marsden B on coal. The Northland Regional
Council received an unprecedented 3000+ submissions opposing the
mothballed Mardsden B being refitting as a coal generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coal is not clean and is certainly not sustainable," said
Atkinson. "The fact Marsden B would emit up to two million tonnes
of carbon dioxide per year " which directly contributes to the
worst environmental problem the world faces " climate change " is
enough alone to make mockery of MRP's claims to
sustainability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRP should stick to what it knows with renewables and put their
new generation investments into genuinely sustainable technologies
such as wind. And it should make the same commitment as Meridian to
only using renewable generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRP failed in their standover tactics against Greenpeace
activists on Monday when a Whangarei court threw out the companies
demand for the activists to pay $19,000 for 'security costs' during

	Greenpeace today slammed Mighty River Power for its attempted legal action to slap a huge bill on the four activists who occupied the roof of Marsden B Power station for nine days in February. The judge rejected Mighty River Power's attempt to get the four to pay a massive $19,089.89 for security costs during the occupation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The activists this morning pleaded guilty to, and were convicted
of, charges of unlawful occupation of a building. Trespass charges
against them were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A conviction isn't to be taken lightly.  However, the
conviction for our occupation is nothing compared with what we all
face if Marsden B is fired up with dirty coal, causing climate
change and sending toxic emissions spewing out over this beautiful
landscape," said one of the activists, Malcolm Wren.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River Power  has shown its true colours. The company has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its application and
persuading local people to support burning coal at Marsden B.   But
as soon as someone mounts a protest, Mighty River tries to silence
them by hitting them with a big bill," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the locals and people all around the country have
overwhelmingly opposed Marsden B, as can be seen over 3000
submissions against the project."   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The activists on the roof undertook their occupation to support
the local community.  Mighty River Power's attempt to get $19,000
off these activists is a slap in the face for the local residents
who are fighting against decades of pollution of their
environment.  No doubt opposition will be strengthened by Mighty
River's standover tactics today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has called a community meeting in Whangarei tonight
to work with local people on ways to keep up the fight against
Mighty River Power's plans.   The meeting will be at the Cafler
Suite, Forum North, Whangarei 7-9pm this evening.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace "Say No to Marsden B" colouring competition
winners will also be announced at the start of the 7pm meeting.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace encourages donations to be made to local community
groups like the Ruakaka Action Group, the Marsden B Action
Group.&lt;/p&gt;

	A Nelson woman was among 60 Greenpeace activists who shut down Inghams main feed silo in Newcastle Australia today. Nelson activist, Kaz Riley is dressed in a chicken suit, locked onto the front gate preventing distribution of Inghams genetically engineered (GE) poultry feed. The action in Australia is an escalation of the campaign against Inghams already running in New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace want the poultry and feed company to stop importing
GE soy for animal feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists dressed in chicken suits blocked Inghams main feed
silo, holding flags saying "Feed me GM-free". A banner has been
unfurled on the silo reading, "INGHAM - putting GM in chicken."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Greenpeace New Zealand activists shut down the
Inghams?Harvey Farms feed mill in Hamilton, demanding that the
Aussie-owned poultry and feed company stop importing GE soy for
animal feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inghams soy is the single biggest source of GE contamination in
both the Australian and New Zealand food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is taking this action on behalf of the majority of
Australian and New Zealand consumers who don't want genetically
engineered crops anywhere in the food chain," said GE Campaigner
John Hepburn. "This concern is justified because there has been no
long-term testing of the impact of GE food on people, animals or
the environment. Consumers are taking part in a genetic engineering
experiment against their wishes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been overwhelming public rejection of chicken fed GE
feed in both New Zealand and Australia. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing of Inghams chicken feed imported into
Australia has found that 70% of the soy used is Monsanto's "Roundup
Ready" genetically engineered soy, most likely imported from the
USA. Greenpeace has identified over 300,000 tonnes of GE soy being
imported into Australia each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is conducting a similar activity at the Inghams silo
in Berrima, and a delegation has taken the message to Inghams
corporate headquarters in Liverpool. The Liverpool delegation, led
by Greenpeace Australia/Pacific CEO Peter Mullins, includes
friendly chicken-suited activists who are engaging with Inghams
employees and shoppers in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As Australia's leading chicken producer, Inghams needs to
follow the lead of the dairy industry and publicly committ to using
non-GE soy to feed their stock," said Hepburn. "GE free soy is
readily available on world markets and making the change would cost
less than 1 cent per chicken - it's chicken-feed!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Market research commissioned by Greenpeace Australia/Pacific
found that: - 61% of consumers don't want to eat foods from animals

	The carbon tax, while a welcome baby step, will not stop polluting, coal-fired power projects like Marsden B and our greenhouse gas emissions will still continue to climb, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Scientists warn we only have ten years to act on climate change
and the Government has acknowledged this urgency. Yet they have set
the carbon tax at a level they know will be ineffective and then
capped it there for the next seven years," said Greenpeace climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also today acknowledged that the carbon tax would
not stop coal-fired power stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River Power is utterly undaunted by the threat of a
carbon tax, and is still proceeding with its plans to build New
Zealand's first major coal-fired power station for 25 years. So now
we're looking at an energy future powered by coal with nothing to
stop it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the government stopped local authorities from being able to
consider greenhouse gas emissions (1) it pointed to the carbon tax
to pick up the load and promised other policies to fill the
gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The carbon tax isn't going to cut it and any other strong
policy has yet to materialise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand needs real policies to reduce our reliance on fossil
fuels, which should include a sustainable energy strategy, policies
to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as
national standards on carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Atkinson said Greenpeace looked forward to hearing
announcements in the Budget, which should include tax incentives
for renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as part of the
money raised by the carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Europe's environment ministers indicated that
the necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions by developed
countries must be between 15-30% for 2020 and 60-80% for 2050.
Europe is taking the lead, and once again New Zealand is being left
behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) In March 2004, the Government amended the Resource
Management Act to remove the ability of local authorities to
consider greenhouse gas emissions of projects. The Government said
at the time that climate change was so important it had to be dealt
with at a national level - and promised, amongst other things, a
carbon tax and national standards on carbon dioxide emissions which
have never been mentioned since.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today applauded Meridian Energy's plans for New Zealand's biggest wind farm, proposed near Wellington and called on Mighty River Power to follow suit, dump their plans for Marsden B coal-fired power station and develop only renewable energy sources.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This wind farm would be a fantastic step towards reducing our
greenhouse gas emissions and tackling the world's biggest threat -
climate change," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson. "The scale of this project demonstrates that wind energy
can produce sizeable chunks of our electricity demand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The transition to renewable energy is absolutely vital. With
scientists warning that we only have 10 years to tackle climate
change to avoid wide-scale ecological, economic and social
disaster, we can no longer afford to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"West Wind is the energy project of the future. Dirty old
climate-change causing coal belongs in the past and plans like
Mighty River Power's Marsden B, should be thrown in the trash where
they belong. Perhaps Mighty River Power should take a leaf out of
Meridian's book and commit to only generating electricity from
renewable sources," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having one of the best wind energy resources on the
planet, this country has lagged woefully behind in embracing the
world's fastest growing energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really drive renewable energy development the Government must
create stronger incentives and policies and map out a long term
sustainable energy strategy for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand needs a diverse mix of renewable energy sources,
including large projects such as West Wind, but also smaller
distributed generation located close to demand, together with
energy efficiency and conservation measures to form a truly
sustainable energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace urges everyone who is concerned about climate change
to put in a submission to Wellington Regional Council voicing
support for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ends&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says the attack on environmentalists by Federated Farmers is an attack on all Kiwis who value our clean and green environment. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately we all benefit from a healthy environment; where we
work, live and play. The right to breathe clean air, drink clean
water and eat food that has not been poisoned, are the fundamental
rights of all New Zealanders," said Cindy Baxter, campaign
manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's clean green reputation and our anti-nuclear
stance are amongst the things that make New Zealanders most
proud".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also dismisses Mr Pederson's assertion that increased
agricultural production is needed to feed the world's poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our colleagues in &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-india/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; will be the first
to tell you that there's enough food to feed every person on the
planet, but it's the world's economic and political systems which
cause hunger in impoverished nations. A recent United Nations
report has also identified degrading ecosystems as a contributing
factor to world hunger. Greenpeace is global, we look far beyond
Charlie Pederson's farm gate," pointed out Ms Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time Federated Farmers rethought their approach to climate
change. While Federated Farmers lobbied against sensible climate
change policies, New Zealand's farmers are likely to be the worst
hit by climate change in NZ: more floods, more droughts and new
pests and diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's all very well to rant about private property rights, but
if your property is washed away because more tropical cyclones hit
New Zealand, your property rights aren't much good. We're all in
this together".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Are we, in 40 years time, going to be hearing farmers asking
ordinary taxpayers for expensive bailouts to pay for the damage
from the extreme weather events which a changing climate will bring
us?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pederson also stated that New Zealand shouldn't act on
climate change because of our tiny contribution to the global
problem. "In New Zealand, we are amongst the biggest polluters per
person. How can we stand up and urge the big polluters to act on
this issue if we're not doing anything here?" said Cindy
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace urged Mr Pederson to not look at "yesterday's
science" but "tomorrow's science" with the development of clean,
green technologies that some New Zealand companies are leading the
world in creating.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Greenpeace slammed the first big failure of Marian Hobbs' new Resource Management Act amendments. In the first publicly known example of the RMA's new "limited notification" rules, a giant new Waikato coal mine, Awaroa 4, is being ferreted though the system with severely restricted public scrutiny. This follows an $800 million panicked coal deal in April between SOEs Solid Energy and Genesis Power also with virtually no scrutiny.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The public are being shut out of key decisions," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson. "This massive mine
proposal threatens to pollute streams, a lake and the Waikato River
with significant flow-on effects that will fuel global warming by
releasing over 26 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere. This deserves public scrutiny and should have been
fully publicly notified."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It sustains a deal that will embed burning more dirty fossil
fuels to generate electricity when we actually need a massive
increase in renewable developments such as windfarms and solar
power," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Awaroa 4 mine proposal has been quickly navigated through
the bureaucracy. This is how it has happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal deal is pushed though and signed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* In April, at the height of the energy crisis, an $800 million
coal deal was signed between Solid Energy and Genesis Power for 11
million tonnes of coal to be delivered over 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The $800 million coal deal escaped the usual scrutiny required
by SOEs with government officials stating they 'didn't have enough
time'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Despite the deal having the largest global warming impacts of
any electricity generating proposal in this country's history, no
alternatives were considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Three government ministers applied pressure for the massive
coal deal to be signed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing the coal mine consents through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Under new "limited notification" RMA rules, Environment
Waikato notified only those people and groups that they decided
might be concerned to have input into the mining proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The consent hearing is this Thursday in Huntly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Prior to passing the new 'limited notification' clauses NGO's
wrote to Helen Clark and warned that limited notification would be
abused by shutting out community groups and the public. Now these
predictions are coming true", concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has condemned the huge hole in policies to manage New Zealand's greenhouse gas pollution, after the Environment Court ruled against part of Greenpeace's appeal opposing the re-firing of Marsden B power station on coal, saying that the effects of the station's discharge on climate change could not be considered.

        &lt;p&gt;
            500 Northland residents march in protest against Might River Power's proposal to turn the mothballed Marsden B power station in Ruakaka into a coal fired power station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision points to a gaping hole in New Zealand's policies
to reduce our greenhouse pollution, a hole big enough to drive a
coal-fired power station through - Marsden B," said Greenpeace
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is outrageous if the first New Zealand coal-fired power
station in 25 years could go ahead without any consideration of its
effects on climate change at any stage in the decision making
process, at a time when scientists are ringing alarm bells about
the urgent need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Resource Management Act (RMA) was amended in 2004 to remove
regional councils' ability to directly manage and regulate
greenhouse emissions. However Greenpeace argued that the RMA still
provides for climate change to be considered through the benefits
of renewable energy development in reducing climate change
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace submitted to the Environment Court that Marsden B
will shut out renewable energy sources, which otherwise would have
lowered greenhouse pollution, so climate change does need to be
considered to that extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Court did not agree and held that it was a
national regulatory issue not for regional councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This decision underlines the current state of disarray of New
Zealand's climate policy and the urgent need to sort out our
climate and energy policies. The Government needs to intervene now
and ensure that climate change impacts of a greenhouse
pollution-belching project like Marsden B are considered. To do
otherwise makes a mockery of New Zealand's acknowledgement of the
dire need to address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need policies to lower our emissions, encourage
renewable technology such as wind farms, stop climate-polluting
power sources such as Marsden B, phase out coal and increase energy
efficiency to lead us to a 100% renewable electricity sector,"
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is considering whether or not to appeal this decision
to the High Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marsden B would annually release up to 2.17 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide and present risks to human health and the
environment from mercury, dioxin and sulphur emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; The interim decision of the Environment Court means that parts of Greenpeace's appeal dealing with renewable energy in the context of climate change were struck out.

The court did agree that the effects of climate change on Marsden B (for example sea level rise) could be considered. Other parts of the appeal such as discharges of mercury, dioxins and sulphur dioxide are still to be considered in the overall appeal against Marsden B which is yet to be heard.

History of Marsden B

In September 2005, Mighty River Power, a Government owned power company, was granted a resource consent by the Northland Regional Council to build New Zealand's first major coal fired power station in over 25 years.

In October 2005, Greenpeace and other community groups lodged an appeal to the Environment Court.

In February 2006, Mighty River Power called for proceedings in the overall appeal to be put on hold while it negotiated access to Department of Conservation land. Another hearing date has yet to be set.

Also in February 2006 MRP submitted to the Environment Court that climate change could not be considered in the overall appeal.

On July 11th 2006 the Environment Court made its decision regarding the relevance of climate change to the overall appeal&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace representatives travelled to Huntly today to request that Environment Waikato re-start the RMA submission process on Awaroa 4, a massive new 11 million tonne coal mine proposed by Solid Energy. Disappointingly councillors Helen Lane, Steve Osbourne and Barry O’Connor decided to continue the undemocratic actions of Environment Waikato and continue the hearing without fully re-notifying the public for input.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Environment Waikato deemed that impacts of the enormous proposed
mine could be described as 'minor'. They used new Resource
Management Act 'limited notification' rules to justify informing
only a small pool of groups and individuals. This excluded the
general public and most public-interest groups from having
appropriate input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, Solid Energy's 225 hectare coal mine proposal is not a
'minor' matter," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson. "Solid Energy plans to move 113 million tonnes of earth
in order to mine the 11 million tonnes of coal beneath, and
redivert a stream. The opencast mine will further contaminate Lake
Waahi from polluted water pumped out of the enormous crater, which
would then run into the Waikato River."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believed Environment Waikato made a mistake so we went to
Huntly today to ask that they re-start the submission period. We'd
like to see Environment Waikato allow anyone in the country who has
a view about the Awaroa 4 mining proposal to be treated fairly and
have their evidence and opinions taken into account when they
assess Solid Energy's application."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is obviously not a little local issue but one that has
significance on a national and international scale. Once the 11
million tonnes of coal is mined, it will be crushed into dust and
burnt at the Huntly Power Station. A Greenpeace scientist has
conservatively estimated that this will contribute 26.4 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that will fuel
dangerous global warming," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This proposal is not only relevant to Waikato locals but also
should be of serious concern to everyone in Auckland. It is a
timely reminder that Aucklanders drink what is dumped further up
the Waikato River."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace calls on the Government to heed the recommendations from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and to intervene immediately and stop a proposal for a coal fired burning power station - Marsden B.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In his report 'Electricity, energy and the environment:
Environmental performance assessment 1 July 2004 - 30 June 2005',
tabled in Parliament today, Morgan Williams says "Proposals for new
coal-fired power stations appear to undermine the Government's
attempts to stabilise New Zealand's carbon emissions and that by
supporting the Marsden B proposal the Government appears to place
short-term economic benefit over the country's international
commitments and considerations of environmental sustainability.
Global warming is an issue that must be taken seriously and
meaningful actions must be taken immediately."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomes this commonsense and clear advice from the
Commissioner and hopes the Government listens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Immediate action required of the Government is to stop the
madness that is Marsden B - the first major coal fired power
station in 25 years," says Greenpeace Campaigner, Vanessa
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We reiterate what the Commissioner says is needed from the
Government - developing renewable sources, and promoting local and
distributed generation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need policies to lower our emissions, encourage
renewable technology such as wind farms, stop climate-polluting
power sources such as Marsden B, phase out coal and increase energy
efficiency to lead us to a 100% renewable electricity sector,"
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday 27 July, Greenpeace will be making a submission to
the hearing of the Climate Protection Amendment Bill that repeals
the sections of the Resource Management (Energy and Climate Change)
Amendment Act which prevent the consideration of climate change in
the granting of air discharge consents and the formulation of
regional plans.&lt;/p&gt;

            Clean Energy Guide Stall in Whangarei
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This time we are taking the campaign to a new level and going
to people's homes, starting in Whangarei and Auckland. We will be
talking to them face to face about where their electricity comes
from; how burning fossil fuels for energy generation is
contributing to climate change; and the choice they can make to buy
electricity from a clean renewable energy company." explains
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders have been in the dark for years about where
their electricity comes from and the Clean Energy Guide is a tool
to help consumers choose the cleanest electricity provider in their
area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have relaunched it now due to strong public demand. Even we
had underestimated the public interest in this information - we
distributed over 80,000 guides and ran out in the first week.
Climate and energy issues are key this year with scientists issuing
more and more dire warnings about climate change and the Government
reviewing its climate and energy policies." says Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace ranked companies on how they currently generate
electricity, and what their future generation plans and policies
are regarding developing renewable energy sources or burning fossil
fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greater emphasis was placed on future plans and future policy
commitments on energy sources. The worst climate offenders are in
the red at the top of the thermometer - because of their
contribution to global warming - and the cleanest electricity
providers are at the bottom in the green (1). The ranking is based
on climate impacts and not on other environmental issues, nor is it
an endorsement of any company &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mighty River Power is ranked in red due to its proposal to fire
up Marsden B, New Zealand's first coal fired power station in 25
years.&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; Marsden B would annually release up to 2
million tonnes of carbon dioxide - the worst greenhouse gas. There
is strong local opposition to it in Whangarei which makes it an
obvious place to relaunch the Clean Energy Guide." said Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent independent poll conducted by TNS for Greenpeace in
October 2005, 70% of people surveyed would prefer to purchase
electricity that comes from clean, renewable generation sources
such as wind or hydro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some areas consumers may save money by making the clean
energy switch. In others it could cost as little as a cup of coffee
a month &lt;sup&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt;. 66% of people surveyed also said they would
be willing to pay more for clean, renewable electricity. Of these,
almost three quarters (74%) were prepared to pay an extra $11 or
more per month, while over 10% were prepared to pay an additional
$90 or more per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Electricity companies should take their customers' preference
for clean energy into account and stop investing in outdated, dirty
fossil fuels like coal and instead invest in renewable energy like
wind and solar." says Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergyguide.org/"&gt;www.CleanEnergyGuide.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) Electricity companies were put into the following three categories. The worst climate offenders are in the red at the top of the thermometer and the cleanest electricity providers are at the bottom in the green.The numbers indicate their actual rank.

Red Companies: Currently burn coal, oil or gas for electricity - or plan to do so in the future. Mercury (MRP) Genesis &amp;amp; Energy Online Contact &amp;amp; Empower Bay of Plenty Electricity

Orange Companies: Only use renewable energy sources for electricity, but have no policy to only invest in renewable sources in the future. (For the purposes of ranking "no policy to only invest in renewable sources in the future" also includes companies that have no stated policy on future generation options, or that refused to answer the question). King Country Electricity TrustPower

Green Companies: Only use renewable energy sources for electricity and have a policy to only invest in renewable sources in the future. Meridian Energy

Companies are allocated scores on the basis of existing generation and proposed generation and their policy on future energy development. A stronger weighting is placed on planned generation as these developments will determine our energy future. A greater penalty has been given to coal as this produces the most carbon dioxide of all the fossil fuels, therefore contributing the most to climate change. Positive emphasis is also placed on companies that have committed to only using renewable energy sources in the future.

(2) This ranking reflects the opinion of Greenpeace and is intended to give Greenpeace supporters and the public an indication of the relative impact of different electricity companies on the climate according to their use, planned use and policy commitments on different energy sources. The ranking assesses companies on their relative impact on climate change only. It does not assess companies on other environmental issues, nor is it an endorsement of any company.

(3) Mighty River Power (who own Mercury Energy) is planning the first major coal-fired power station in the country for over 25 years, at Marsden B near Whangarei. The proposal attracted a nationwide outcry and a record number of submissions to the Regional Council (over 3,000), of which over 95% were opposed. Despite this, Mighty River Power was granted resource consents in September 2005 to proceed with the station. In October 2005 Greenpeace lodged an appeal against this decision in the Environment Court. In February 2006, Mighty River Power called for proceedings to be put on hold while it negotiated access to Department of Conservation land. In June 2006, Mighty River Power asked for an extension until 14 July 2006.

	Greenpeace has staged a whale stranding in Mission Bay, Auckland today, to highlight the start of a court case against two Japanese activists.

The activity was timed to coincide with similar activities around the world, directed at the Japanese government and asking for justice for the activists and for whales.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace New Zealand staged a whale stranding in Mission Bay, one of Auckland's most popular beaches, today, to highlight the court case of two activists for their part in exposing corruption in the Japanese whaling industry. The action was part of an international peaceful protest directed at the Japanese government asking for justice for Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki known as the 'Tokyo 2' and justice for the whales. The five metre inflatable minke whale was beached to symbolise their plight. Activists placed Japanese daimyo banners around the whale which read "Free the Tokyo 2 and Put Whaling on Trial". 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May last year, Greenpeace campaigners Junichi Sato and Toru
Suzuki exposed a black market in whale meat run by the crew of the
Japanese whaling ships (1). The following month the pair were
arrested and held in custody for 26 days, with Amnesty
International and 250,000 people from around the world condemning
the political nature of the arrests and charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, many months later, Junichi and Toru (known as the Tokyo 2)
remain under strict bail conditions, unable to work or communicate
freely with their Greenpeace colleagues and awaiting the conclusion
of the trial, which is likely to end in a jail term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A five metre inflatable minke whale was beached at Mission Bay
to symbolise their plight. Activists placed Japanese daimyo banners
around the whale which read Free the Tokyo 2 and Put Whaling on
Trial. Following the activity, Greenpeace executive director Bunny
McDiarmid delivered a letter to the Japanese Ambassador's office,
in Wellington, demanding his interest in the case, support for the
Tokyo 2 and for him to ask the same of his government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzette Jackson, communications manager for Greenpeace New
Zealand: "It's not Greenpeace activists who should be put on trial;
it's the government-backed whaling programme in the Southern Ocean
Whale Sanctuary. We ask for immediate justice for the Tokyo 2 and
an end to the Japanese government's internationally criticised
whaling programme."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junichi and Toru had reported their findings with the intention
of raising awareness about the abuse of taxpayer subsidies, and to
prompt an independent investigation into the programme [2]. They
could face up to ten years in prison if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first formal court hearing in preparation for the actual
trial took place in Aomori, Japan last Friday, 13 February.
Following the hearing - which was closed to media and the public -
lawyers acting on behalf of the two men outlined the intended
defence. Sato and Suzuki are jointly charged with theft and
trespass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Neither activist had any intent of illegal acquisition, which
is one of the elements of the crime of "theft" as defined by
Japanese domestic law", said lead counsel for the defendants,
Yuichi Kaido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, from the perspective of international law, Junichi
and Toru's acts were an exercise of the right to freedom of
expression, which is guaranteed in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)" [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second pre-trial hearing for the two activists is set for 23
March, while the date of commencement of the public trial has not
yet been decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson said Greenpeace was requesting the Japanese government
conduct an independent inquiry into the clandestine operation on
board the factory ship Nisshin Maru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is clear to Greenpeace that the production of products for
private sale, from whales caught under scientific permits, does not
comply with the International Whaling Commission's
requirements".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation

2) An investigation begun by Sato and Suzuki in April 2008 focused on organised whale meat embezzlement conducted by whaling fleet crew from Japan’s so-called “scientific” whaling programme, which is funded by Japanese taxpayers. Following information from an informer who had previously been involved in the whaling programme, Sato and Suzuki discovered firm evidence that cardboard boxes containing whale meat were being secretly shipped to the homes of whaling fleet crew – and then sold for personal profit. Junichi Sato delivered a box of this whale meat to the Tokyo Prosecutors’ Office in May 2008, and filed a report of embezzlement. However, the embezzlement investigation was dropped on 20 June – the same day that both men were arrested and then held for 26 days before being charged with theft and trespass.

3) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Japan in 1979, has the force of law in Japan’s legal system, and prevails over inconsistent domestic laws.  In Article 19, the ICCPR recognises that freedom of expression not only includes the freedom to “impart” information, but also freedom “for everyone” to “seek” and “receive” it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Tokyo Two" - Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru
Suzuki - were arrested and held without charge for 26 days last
year after they intercepted a quantity of whale meat stolen by crew
from the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru. Their trial will take
place in the traditional northern fishing and whaling town of
Aomori in the coming months. They face up to 10 years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aomori communications office, opened yesterday with a
traditional sake barrel ceremony, will be a place where Greenpeace
can talk to the public about Japan's commercial whaling, as well as
other issues like ocean conservation, climate change and genetic
modification. New Zealanders will work at the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner Karli Thomas says that
talking directly to the people of Japan is vital to ending
commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We'll be talking to them about whether taxpayers' money should
continue to be spent on expensive whaling expeditions which produce
science nobody needs, and stockpiles of whale meat that fewer and
fewer people want," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The future of whaling is in their hands. When the Japanese
people decided that whaling is no longer acceptable and that it is
causing more harm than good, they will tell their government
that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public events, including a conference on sustainable fishing,
are planned for the centre for coming months and will focus on
building healthy oceans and marine reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Japan executive director Jun Hoshikawa said that many
Greenpeace sustainability campaigns have special relevance to
Aomori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is one of Japan's most crucial fishery and agriculture
centres, so we're here to listen, to understand, to explain, and to
help take on problematic issues like the impacts of industrial
fishing, which stand in the way of communities like Aomori finding
a more sustainable relationship with the ocean, for the sake of
future generations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says there are many positive aspects, including the important role of renewable energy in the Government's recently announced climate and energy policy programmes. However, there are also some areas of concern which could distract attention away from the main issue - getting our greenhouse gas emissions down.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, the test for the work programme will be
the policies that come out the other side. These policies must
include emission reduction targets, binding measures to get us
there, a price on carbon and greenhouse pollution and a commitment
to move New Zealand to 100% renewable energy in the electricity
sector," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government has indicated that 100% renewable energy in the
non-transport sector could be a goal for New Zealand. Greenpeace
urges the Government to adopt a goal for 100% renewable electricity
sector by 2020 in its final climate policy package."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is also excellent that the Government has acknowledged the
importance of putting a price on greenhouse pollution which is
needed to drive investment in clean technologies to get our
emissions down. We urge this to be a component of the final policy
package," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climate and energy policy programmes also includes
substantial work on preparing for climate impacts " or "adaptation"
to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While adaptation is an important area, we are concerned that
too much emphasis on this could be a distraction from the real
challenge " lowering our greenhouse gas emissions. The focus needs
to be on prevention, not cure," said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Government has also indicated some enthusiasm
for non-binding international agreements on climate change, like
the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate
(AP6). &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyoto is the only internationally legally binding agreement with
targets, timelines and tools to drive emission reductions. We need
to remain focused on Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is important to take time to consult and develop policies to
get our response to climate change right and this has to be done in
a time frame that reflects the urgency of the threat. Scientists
warn we have only 10 years to act. Greenpeace applauds plans for
thorough consultation and it is in everyone's interest to get
behind the programme and engage in developing effective climate
policy," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) The AP6 comprises USA, Australia, Japan, China, India and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace said today’s announcement by Sealord of a proposal to voluntarily stop bottom trawling in some areas of the Indian Ocean is a deceitful smokescreen to divert public and political attention from the need for a total worldwide moratorium on the destructive fishing practice in international waters.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Just as Sealord tried to distance itself from whaling, they are
now trying to wash their hands of the damage they've already done
and continue to bottom trawl in vulnerable areas while 'protecting'
areas they're not interested in", says oceans campaigner Mike
Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Let's not forget that these bottom trawlers are out there, 24
hrs a day, bulldozing life on the deep sea floor. Scientists have
warned that, globally, species are being pushed to extinction
before they are named. These sorts of proposals aimed to prevent
real effective action are really self-appointed consents for
extinction. This is not responsible. This is not sustainable".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And like the industry's February proposal to 'protect' 30% of
New Zealand waters from bottom trawling, you can be sure that the
industry will again be asserting to 'protect' areas that they don't
want to fish anyway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest proposal serves less to protect biodiversity and
more to deflect public criticism of bottom trawling and pre-empt
growing momentum for political action at the UN level for a global
moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN is meeting later this year to decide what bottom trawling
restrictions would be applied in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine vessels were reported to have been fishing in the
southern Indian Ocean between 1999 and 2001. Catches peaked in
2,000. Yet by 2002 only half a dozen vessels were spotted. By then,
populations of orange roughy had been severely depleted or
collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just three years, fishing vessels from eight to sixteen
countries - including Sealord from New Zealand - had severely
depleted Orange Roughy and Alfonsinos populations in the Southern
Indian Ocean and butchered their habitats. Today just four vessels
fish in the areas - two of these are Sealord vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is unlikely the areas proposed for closure in the India
Ocean will represent all the vulnerable areas at risk from bottom
trawling. Some of these areas will be too deep to bottom trawl and
others will have already been destroyed by past fishing, with no
fish left to catch".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Significantly, this industry proposal has not been subject to
an independent scientific evaluation to determine which areas of
seamounts need to be protected. So it is difficult to accept that
the closed areas the industry is voluntarily proposing have been
selected on a scientific or precautionary basis".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry proposal will not provide for legally binding
measures unless individual countries agree to prohibit their
vessels and nationals from fishing in these areas. The proposal
will not ensure that all ecologically vulnerable areas are
protected, nor will it address the problem of unsustainable
fishing, or halt destructive fishing practices anywhere outside the
voluntary protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Governments, including New Zealand and Australia, meeting in
Rome this week to sign the South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement,
should not be fooled by this crude attempt by the fishing industry
to divert them from imposing real measures to the protect deep-sea
biodiversity from bottom trawling. This is only the fishing
industry protecting their own profits", concluded Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

	Early this morning, 11 Greenpeace activists scaled a 150-metre high chimney at the Pątnów power plant in Poland to hang a banner reading "Quit coal, save the climate". 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The action comes one day after the opening of the UN Climate
Negotiations in Poznan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland has plans to build coal-fired power plants and open new
mines, which it is using as a reason to resist the EU climate
package currently being finalised (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This action is just part of a worldwide call for real action
at the UN climate talks," said Greenpeace New Zealand Senior
Climate Campaigner. "Our colleagues in Poland are highlighting one
of the key drivers of climate change - coal. But the other big
driver is of course industrial agriculture, which New Zealand is
contributing to more and more each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every country and every government has a part to play in
helping avoid catastrophic climate change - be developed,
developing, big or small."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pątnów plant (2) runs on lignite, the most CO2 polluting
fuel, from the nearby Konin open cast mine. The Konin mine company
plans to open a new open cast mine in Tomislawice to fuel the
plant, threatening both the climate and the local environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time when we have hopes that the US will join global
efforts to combat climate change, the self-interested positions of
both Poland and Germany are forcing the EU to weaken its climate
package. Now is the time for real leadership from the EU, from
Poland and Germany(3), " said Magdalena Zowsik, climate and energy
campaigner of Greenpeace Poland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is little time left to stop dangerous climate change -
global emissions must peak by 2015 and be reduced by 80-95 percent
by 2050. Otherwise, 3 billion people could suffer increased water
stress, and hundreds of millions face food insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the UN Climate Negotiations in Poznan governments must
agree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    a "climate vision" that will address what the science
requires: global emissions peaking by 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    a draft text on the table to start negotiations in
March&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    a detailed work plan to get this completed by Copenhagen in
December 2009; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    developed countries must agree greenhouse gas emission
reduction targets at the upper end of 25-40 percent, as identified
by the IPCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "New Zealand must agree to adopt binding emission reduction
targets at the Poznan meeting of between 25-40 per cent by 2020,"
said Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Jacek Winiarski - Press officer, Greenpeace Poland

	Greenpeace declared the outcome of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission a failed compromise – one which is too weak to stop the overfishing of the Pacific bigeye and yellowfin tuna – but applauds the positive decision to close two of the high seas pockets(1) between Pacific Island Countries to purse seine fishing from 2010. The Commission will also consider the closure of the third such area in 2009. Greenpeace has been campaigning for these areas to be designated as marine reserves in order to support sustainable fisheries, protect Pacific marine life and to clean up pirate fishing in the region. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning since 2001 that the bigeye and
yellowfin stocks in the Pacific are in decline and recommended a
minimum of 30% fishing effort reduction for 2009. Yet the
commission only agreed to a compromise measure to cut fishing on
bigeye with a range of measures including a 10% reduction in
longline catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Island countries, and the
US all put up a strong front, but the resistance from Japan, Korea,
China, Chinese Taipei and Philippines meant the Commission failed
to reduce catch enough to make a difference," said Lagi Toribau,
Greenpeace Australia Pacific Oceans Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big fishing powers resisted moves to ensure the long-term
sustainability of the fishery, despite strong economic reasons to
do so (2). Recent studies indicate that the fishing industry is
undermining its own profits by having too many fishing vessels on
the water and by depleting stocks to the point that fish are harder
to catch. Greenpeace called for a precautionary 50% effort
reduction to be implemented in order to ensure both the long term
sustainability and profitability of the fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A handful of fishing nations are sending entire species into
oblivion. Consensus based decision making ensured that many
decisions here were diluted to the lowest common denominator of
agreement. Short term interests ruled. And the needs of the Pacific
Island States, whose livelihoods and economies depend on tuna, have
been relegated to a minority voice," continued Toribau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the industry itself who were present in the meeting
called upon the fishing nations to follow the advice of scientists
and reduce fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The political process is still unable to follow science.  If
the industry wants to ensure fish for the future, Greenpeace is
calling on retailers and fish purchasers  to stop  buying all
overfished bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as well as skipjack
caught using fish aggregation devices," said Karli Thomas of
Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of fully
protected marine reserves covering 40% of our oceans as an
essential way to protect our seas from the ravages of climate
change, to restore the health of fish stocks and protect ocean life
from habitat destruction and collapse.  Greenpeace has been
campaigning for tuna protection in Korea with the Korean Federation
for the Environmental Movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Suzette Jackson – 021 614 899&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) Map and further information at &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/pacific-commons"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/pacific-commons&lt;/a&gt;

(2) Economic models have shown that effort reduction in the number of fishing vessels in the Pacific is key to increasing the profitability of the industry and the long-term sustainability of the fishery.

	The just-released United Nations Secretary General's Review of measures taken by states to protect vulnerable deep-sea life from destructive fishing practices such as high seas bottom trawling has confirmed that the protection these areas receive is woefully inadequate and that urgent action is required now by the international community.

        &lt;p&gt;
            12-06-2005, West Norfolk Ridge, Tasman Sea: Crew on New Zealand bottom trawler Waipori wrestle with a large piece of 400 year old Paragorgia coral hauled up from the deep-sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's taken two years for this UN review to confirm what
everyone knew already: that deep-sea life and vulnerable habitats
like cold water corals are being wiped out by a relatively few
number of extremely destructive bottom trawlers. That's two years
in which extinctions have almost certainly occurred, and in which
vast swathes of irreplaceable deep ocean ecosystems have been wiped
out by bottom trawling. The UN must take the only step which can
halt this uncontrolled destruction, to establish a moratorium on
bottom trawling in international waters when the General Assembly
(UNGA) meets in October," says Karen Sack, oceans policy advisor to
Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Review was requested by the UNGA in 2004 and was conducted
by the UN Secretary General. It is based on submissions by member
states reporting on what they have done individually, and as
members of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOS), to
stop destructive fishing practices - including bottom trawling -
that threaten deep-sea fish stocks and biodiversity in
international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pointing to the extreme vulnerability of deep ocean ecosystems,
the Review says: "Among all the fishing gears currently used
particular concern has been raised over the adverse impacts of
bottom trawling on vulnerable marine ecosystems and their
associated biodiversity." It adds: "It appears that, beyond the
"first level" of visual, short-term impacts on biodiversity, there
is uncertainty on the long-term detrimental impacts of trawling on
vulnerable marine ecosystems, and further research is urgently
needed. In this regard, the application of the precautionary
approach needs to be emphasized."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is a member of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition
(DSCC) an alliance of nearly 60 international environmental and
conservation organisations who have been campaigning for a
moratorium on high seas bottom trawling since 2003 and condemned
the UNGA's postponement of such action pending the Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Gianni from the DSCC said, "NGOs, scientists even
governments have repeatedly said that the existing measures are
inadequate and that a Review would only confirm this. Sadly it is a
Review which has cost the deep oceans two years worth of
protection. This must now be the year when the buck passing
stops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UN gave governments two years to try to resolve the problem
without a high seas moratorium, and it hasn't worked", said Mike
Hagler Greenpeace's Oceans Campaigner in New Zealand. "Responsible
governments do the responsible thing: they put in place a temporary
ban that allows the time to make science-based decisions about
where the vulnerable areas that need protection are located, and
where fishing can safely take place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recently we've seen the fishing industry submit proposals for
areas to be closed to bottom trawling. We welcome the fact that
industry is now recognizing the damage caused to biodiversity by
bottom trawling and sees the need for closures. However, there are
problems with this approach:  they're not based on any scientific
analysis and they're very difficult to enforce. Proposals, such as
one by industry for the Indian Ocean, may simply divert bottom
trawlers into new and possibly even more sensitive and diverse
areas. We must avoid this at all costs because we don't get any
second chances with extinction", said Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"More than 30 governments now support the need for a moratorium.
It is now time for New Zealand to follow advice given by the UN
itself and support this idea. If the international community fails
to take action to protect the global commons when the evidence is
so clear cut, one must seriously call into question its ability to
manage other global resources of benefit to all humankind,"
concluded Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negotiations around a moratorium will occur at the UNGA on
October 4 and 5 prior to decisions being made in November on a
global moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN Secretary General's report clearly indicated that no high
seas areas of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans have yet been
closed to bottom trawl fishing to protect deep-sea ecosystems
except for four seamounts in the Northeast Atlantic (of the 10s of
thousands of seamounts estimated to lie in high seas areas
worldwide) and a small section of the mid-Atlantic ridge.
Elsewhere, the Southern Ocean around Antarctica is effectively
closed to bottom trawl fishing unless it can be proved to be
harmless to the marine environment, and in the Mediterranean Sea, a
number of high seas areas have been declared off limits to bottom
trawl fishing, including all areas beneath 1000 metres.&lt;/p&gt;

	National needs to tackle corporate dairy farming’s role in deforestation if it wants to truly improve forestry in New Zealand, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Corporate dairy farming is driving current rates of
deforestation," said Greenpeace Senior Climate Campaigner Simon
Boxer. "Tens of thousands of hectares of forests have already been
felled to make way for corporate farms. Another half million
hectares is at risk; over seven times the size of Lake Taupo and a
quarter of the nation's total plantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National's forestry policy fails to mention this.  Every
political party's forestry policy must level the playing field by
making the agricultural sector pay for its environmental impact
under the emissions trading scheme (ETS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Until this is done, the forestry sector and the climate will
continue to pay the price. So will Kiwi taxpayers, as our Kyoto
bill skyrockets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is currently exempt from the ETS until 2013.
Greenpeace is calling for the sector to be included well before
that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Boxer also said National would need to ban illegal forest
product imports if it leads the next government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National's forestry policy falls well short of what's needed to
promote sustainable forestry. Its feel-good pledges won't ensure
that illegally logged timber is kept out of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recently, environmental NGOs and New Zealand foresters agreed
on a joint position to tackle imports of illegally sourced wood
products.  National should back this position by agreeing to ban
imports of wood products."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for a halt to forest conversions for dairy
farming, for agriculture to be brought in under the ETS before 2013
and for New Zealand to set an overall emission reduction target of
30 per cent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Simon Boxer– Senior Climate Campaigner - 021905579

            The Greenpeace ships MY Esperanza and MY Arctic Sunrise in Cape Town on the day of the launch of the most ambitious ship expedition the organization has ever undertaken to protect and restore the health of the world's oceans.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace ships, the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise,
successfully shut down the whaling operation yesterday after
finding the fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, south-west
of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand whales campaigner Pia Mancia said that
the Greenpeace vessels had remained near the whalers through the
short Antarctic night, but there had been no whaling activity since
yesterday afternoon, when the Greenpeace crews stopped the loading
of dead whales by positioning their vessels between the whaling
fleet's catcher boats and mother ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yesterday we stopped the slaughter of whales, but we expect the
whaling fleet will try to resume operations today," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are ready for them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that Greenpeace needed to take non-violent
direct action because international diplomacy had failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have an international ban in whaling in place, the Southern
Ocean has been declared a whale sanctuary, and yet the slaughter
continues," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace will continue to confront this fleet in order to
draw the world's attention to what is going on and to prevent the
death of as many whales as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan announced earlier this year that
it intended doubling its whale take to 1000, including the
threatened fin whales - the second largest whales in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency describes its whaling operation as scientific in
order to exploit an IWC loophole, but the meat from the whales will
end up on the shelves of Japanese markets as an expensive luxury
item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that whale populations ere also being threatened
by environmental factors such as toxic pollution and climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today launched an online database of fishing vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and the companies that own them.  

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The 'IUU blacklist' goes public just as New Zealand officials
attend the West and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission meeting
today in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, to discuss
increased regulation of tuna fishing in the Pacific where IUU
fishing of the regional tuna stocks is rife (1).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - often referred to
as "pirate fishing" - has become a global scourge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a multi-billion dollar business that affects many
communities, especially from developing countries such as those in
the Pacific that can least afford to be robbed of their livelihoods
and sustenance," said Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.
"It leaves the marine environment bruised and battered, undermining
food security and attempts at sustainable management."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally US $9 billion a year is lost to pirate fishing and
estimates in the Pacific range from US$134 million to US$400
million. Pirate fishing amounts to four times more than Pacific
Island states earn in access fees and licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia Pacific Oceans campaigner Lagi Toribau said
two things can be done to reduce piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Transfer of fishing catches at sea should be banned and marine
reserves created in international waters which are bound by Pacific
Island countries, which are off-limits to all fishing.  This would
close off a safe escape route currently open to pirates illegally
fishing adjacent to national waters," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace IUU blacklist (blacklist.greenpeace.org) is the
first one-stop independent record of fishing vessels, support
vessels and companies involved in pirate fishing.  It includes
independent observations from the legal fishing industry,
government authorities, and first-hand evidence from Greenpeace and
other NGOs who have recorded the activities of these vessels and
companies at sea and in port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's time for greater transparency: for fish purchasers,
retailers, and the public to see who is involved in pirate fishing
and for ship owners to start taking responsibility for their role,"
said Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several tuna species are listed as 'don't buy species' on
Greenpeace New Zealand's Red Fish List, a consumer guide that lists
12 of the most unsustainable seafood species currently available on
retail shelves. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Currently most tuna on New Zealand supermarket shelves fails
doesn't show the country of origin, how it was caught and what
company is doing the catching. Kiwi shoppers have the right to know
this information," concluded Ms Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace advocates the creation of an effectively enforced
network of marine reserves, protecting 40% of the world's oceans -
with regulated, sustainable fishing in other areas - as the
long-term solution to overfishing and the recovery of marine life
in our overexploited oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Karli Thomas, Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner 021 905 582

	New Zealanders should be seriously alarmed at the prospect of the National-led government damaging the country’s relationship with the United States over its stance on climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a surprise speech to a Global Climate Summit in Los Angeles
(1), US President-Elect Barack Obama has thrown down the gauntlet
to global leaders over climate change. He says all nations willing
to fight climate change have an ally in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Senior Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer said it
followed that if countries failed to accept the realities of
climate change and failed put in place strong measures to address
it, then they were foes of the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is at serious risk of becoming an international
Pariah over climate, and jeopodising its international standing and
trade relations. The last thing we want is to become the equivalent
of the French Government during nuclear testing in the
Pacific."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, Obama says: "Now's the time to confront this
challenge once and for all. Delay is no longer an option. Denial is
no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high." He says
the US cannot meet the challenge alone and needs all nations
onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I just hope he hasn't gotten wind of the new government of New
Zealand," said Boxer, "which is not even sure it believes in
manmade climate change, and in its first two weeks in power has
pledged to dismantle every single piece of New Zealand climate
policy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama issued a special directive to international delegates
meeting in Poznan, Poland next month, for the next round of UN
climate talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Your work is vital to the planet," he said. "While I won't be
president at the time of your meeting… once I take office, you can
be sure that the US will once again engage vigorously in these
negotiations and help lead the world toward a new era of global
cooperation on climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Boxer urged the New Zealand delegation heading to Poznan to
accept its international responsibility and commit to binding
emission reduction targets. (2) Greenpeace is also calling on the
Government to set a domestic emission reduction target of 30 per
cent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Simon Boxer – Senior Climate Campaigner - 021905579

	Greenpeace today welcomed the positive decision on the construction of New Zealand's biggest wind farm at Makara on the western coast of Wellington.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a great day for New Zealand's transition towards
sustainability in our electricity sector," said Campaigner Steve
Abel. "West Wind is proof that major portions of our electricity
needs can be met with wind energy. The expansion of clean,
renewable energy generation is essential if we are to address the
planet's biggest problem - climate change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace called on SOE Meridian to "do the country proud," in
terms of the thorough mitigation of impacts at the construction and
rehabilitation stages. "If done well this project has the potential
to become a national icon of sustainability," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says the impacts of the wind farm need to be put into
perspective. "In terms of the environmental, landscape and human
impact of wind versus other generation methods such as coal, gas,
geothermal or big hydro - wind is clearly in front on all counts
for being the most sustainable. The impact on future generations
and the New Zealand landscape of catastrophic climate change will
be a thousand times worse than the relatively minor impact of wind
farms," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Government's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King has
said that climate change is 'the most serious issue facing us this
century and beyond.' "Not to utilise our exceptional wind resources
such as here in Wellington to meet our electricity needs and burn
polluting coal and gas instead would be a total crime in the face
of climate change," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project at 210 megawatts will be able to power 110,000 homes
in the Wellington, Porirua and Lower Hutt region and will avoid the
emission of 520,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year if the
electricity were to be generated using coal. That's the equivalent
to taking 120,000 cars off the road every year or planting 777,000
trees (according to EECA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is very critical of the axing of the carbon charge
and believes that to really drive renewable energy development the
Government must create stronger incentives and legislation and map
out a long-term sustainable energy strategy for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand needs a diverse mix of renewable energy sources,
including projects such as West Wind, but also smaller distributed
generation located close to demand. With existing hydro, new small
hydro, geothermal, biomass, solar, wind, energy efficiency and
conservation measures we can move towards a 100% renewable energy
system and rule out the need for polluting and climate offending
coal and gas generation such as Marsden B with its raft of negative
health, visual, economic and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

	According to news reports in Japan this morning, there will be a 20 per cent reduction in the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hunt this year - the first reduction since 1987.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;The report in Asahi Shinbum cites lack of demand for whale meat,
pressure from protests at sea and the continued opposition from Europe and &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Australia&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt; as
reasons for the reduction in the minke whale quota from 945 minke whales to
750. The quota of 50 endangered fin whales remains unchanged.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"We are seeing the beginning of the end of whaling in the Southern Ocean
Whale Sanctuary," said Karli Thomas, Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner.
"If today's reports are true we congratulate the Japanese government for
making this first step, but they can and must go further and we will not stop
until the quota is zero." &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;The news follows
hard on the heels of Greenpeace revelations that the industry has been unable
to crew this year's voyage with an all-Japanese crew for the first time, that
the traditional ceremony seeing the fleet off from Shimonoseki has been
cancelled, and that 'Yushin,' the flagship whale meat shop and restaurant in
Asakusa, Tokyo, will close shop in 2010 due to ongoing financial problems. [1]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Greenpeace has sent ships to interfere with the hunt in the Southern Ocean nine
times since the Japanese government research whaling programme in the Southern
Ocean whale sanctuary began 20 years ago, including keeping them on the run for
more than two weeks last season. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Opposition inside &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Japan&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;
is also growing. Earlier this year two Greenpeace activists in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Japan&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt; were
arrested for exposing corruption within the whaling programme. The political
prosecution of Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki has been denounced by Amnesty
International and, in a periodic evaluation completed last month, the United
Nations Human Rights Committee severely reprimanded the Japanese government for
the "unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of expression" in
Japan. It also condemned the abuse of trespass laws by Japanese police to
harass activists who are critical of government policy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"The extreme reaction by the authorities shows Greenpeace's work in &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;Japan&lt;/country-region&gt; has put the whaling establishment under
pressure" said Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace &lt;country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;place w:st="on"&gt;Japan&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;.
"The whale meat market has clearly collapsed and is unprofitable, and the
stigma of scandal and corruption has made it an unattractive and less lucrative
industry to work for. The whaling industry's days are numbered, and it's time
for the Japanese taxpayer to demand the government stops subsidising this
bankrupt programme."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	"How often does one walk into one of these things and come out at the end of it at 6 in the morning with just about everything you asked for coming in? Not very often." That was Greenpeace climate campaigner Steve Sawyer's reaction at the end of the Climate summit in Montreal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Kyoto Protocol is stronger today than it was two weeks ago.
This historic first Meeting of the Parties has acknowledged the
urgency of the threat that climate change poses to the world's
poorest people, and eventually, to all of us. The decisions made
here have cleared the way for long term action," said Bill Hare,
Greenpeace International Climate Policy Advisor in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;The meeting agreed the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To start urgent negotiations on a new round of emission
reduction targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto
Protocol (2013-2017). A special group has been established to
ensure that these negotiations are concluded "as soon as possible".
This is necessary to ensure the continuity of carbon markets, and
to allow governments to put policies and measures in place to
ensure that the new, deeper emission reduction targets are met&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To start now to review and improve the Kyoto Protocol. Mandated
under the existing treaty, this review will formally begin at next
year's meeting.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A Five Year Plan of Action on Adaptation, to assist least
developed countries to cope with the impacts of climate change.
This programme will begin to address the fact that climate change
already impacts the world's poorest, and that it will get much
worse in the coming decades. It is the ethical, political, and
legal responsibility of the industrialised countries to provide for
this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, the Bush administration attempted to derail the
process, at one point even walking out of the negotiations, but the
rest of the world showed a resolve to move ahead regardless. For
once, the Bush administration was forced back to the table and into
agreement with the international community. No doubt the
overwhelming presence of U.S. civil society at these talks has had
a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has continued to attempt to lure countries away from the
UN multilateral climate regime with its international emission
trading to an ineffective approach based on voluntary actions and
'partnerships'. Today, however, governments have agreed to hold
substantive talks beginning in May 2006 on the Kyoto Protocol's
second commitment period, sending an unmistakable signal that we
are on the road to new and more ambitious targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Sawyer, "What will be remembered is that this was
the moment when the future of the Kyoto Protocol and legally
binding emissions reductions and the cap and trade system was
secured...Australia and the US are isolated as never before, and
the overwhelming presence of US state governments, cities, trade
unions, businesses, churches, youth and many other parts of civil
society gave the rest of the world confidence that Americans do
care about climate change, and that the Bush administration's
intransigence will sooner rather than later be remembered as an
unfortunate historical footnote."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace announced today the next phase of its campaign to end lethal whaling by ramping up its activities in Japan. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ending the political prosecution of two Greenpeace activists in
Japan, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, the "Tokyo two", will become
the central focus of a mass mobilisation campaign against the
Japanese Government's whale hunt in the Southern Ocean Whaling
Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will not send a ship to the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sato and Suzuki have been denied their liberty for 138 days,
since exposing corruption within the annual so-called scientific
research whaling programme last May. Early next year they will be
put on trial. They face up to 10 years in jail for intercepting
whale meat stolen by crew from the whaling factory ship Nisshin
Maru. The activists were arrested on June 20th 2008 and spent 26
days in custody before being charged. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jun Hoshikawa, Executive Director of Greenpeace Japan said:
"After many expeditions to defend the whales in the Southern Ocean
Whale Sanctuary, Greenpeace has saved hundreds of whales. But, if
we are to bring this hunt to an end, we have to bring change in
Tokyo."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Based on our 30 years of experience of campaigning against
whaling, Greenpeace has decided that at this stage in the global
campaign, our efforts need to focus on continuing to shift public
opinion in Japan," said Karli Thomas, Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans
Campaigner. "Our research in Japan shows that over 70 per cent of
Japanese people do not support high seas whaling, and ordinary
Japanese people are starting to question the use of tax-payers
money to support an outdated and globally unpopular industry."
(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Outside of Japan, in the coming months we will put the Japanese
Government on trial by calling on whale defenders world-wide to
become co-defendants with the Tokyo Two, and give evidence against
the whaling programme." said Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date a quarter of a million people have called on Japan's
prime minister to drop the charges and release the activists.(3)
The launch will coincide with the 60th anniversary of the adoption
of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights in
December, and run through until the trial early in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in the focus of the Greenpeace anti-whaling campaign
follows many strategic successes, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    Causing the de-flagging of the whaling fleet re-supply
ship, the Oriental Bluebird last month, potentially cutting this
years' hunt in half (4),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    Pressuring seafood suppliers Gorton's, Sealord and parent
company Nissui to withdraw financial support for the Japanese
whaling industry, leaving them totally government funded since
April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VVPR info:&lt;/b&gt; Suzette Jackson Greenpeace New Zealand communications manager 021 614 899
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) Greenpeace investigation: Japan's stolen whale meat scandal, May 15 2008 – dossier available from: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/whale-meat-scandal-dossier&lt;/a&gt;

2) Opinion poll on research whaling, conducted in Japan by Nippon Research Center Ltd, a member of Gallup International Association. February 2008
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/japanese-opinion-whaling-2008"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/japanese-opinion-whaling-2008&lt;/a&gt;

3) More than 250,000 Greenpeace supporters sent protest emails to the Japanese prime minister, asking him to release the activists. In addition, a joint statement of concern was issued to the prime minister by 35 international non-governmental organisations, which included Amnesty International, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and Humane Society International. A motion to release the men was passed in the Australian parliament and questions were raised in the UK parliament.

(4) Following actions at sea and pressure by Greenpeace, the Oriental Bluebird has been fined by the Panamanian Government and de-flagged after its involvement in the whaling programme was ruled illegal. The Japanese Government has ratified an international treaty which seeks to end the practice of 'flag hopping' to evade environmental law, therefore is duty-bound under international law not to use the vessel's services for at least three years. There are very few alternative vessels. It is estimated that the Oriental Bluebird is responsible for taking around 50 per cent of the whaling fleet's catch back to Japan, as well as refuelling the whaling fleet within the Antarctic Treaty area enabling them to remain at sea for around four months.

	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and ECO (1) surveyed all parties on a range of
pressing environmental issues facing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We asked the political parties to commit to 25 policies that
would tackle climate change, clean up New Zealand's rivers, save
our oceans, protect natural heritage and exercise environmental
leadership.  Both major parties refused to make clear commitments,"
said ECO spokeswoman Cath Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "A Labour-led government may do more for the environment than a
National-led one, but, judging by their commitments, the main
parties will need the influence of the Maori Party and the Greens
if they are to make real progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by how poorly both the two major parties
scored.  Neither seems to have what it takes to keep New Zealand
clean and green."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the eight main Parliamentary political parties were
asked to confirm their commitment to the 25 environmental policies
with a yes or no, and given space to clarify their answers.  Of the
seven political parties that responded, only National and Labour
refused to answer "yes" or "no".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"National scored abysmally.  They refused to sign up to any of
the policies, but they picked up 27% for making some small steps in
the right direction.," said Wallace. "Worryingly, along with United
Future, National had the worst response of any party on responding
to climate change (4/20) and had the weakest approach of any party
to cleaning up New Zealand's freshwater (2/20). ACT refused to even
respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Labour also refused to commit fully to any of the policies, but
their comments on the survey show they're willing to do more than
National for the environment.  They scored 45% overall.  Their
strongest commitments were in saving our oceans (12/20) and saving
New Zealand's natural heritage (12/20). Labour made few commitments
to clean up New Zealand's freshwater (5/20) or to show
environmental leadership (5/20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"United Future gained 53%, scoring well on cleaning up New
Zealand's freshwater, but did very badly on tackling climate change
(4/20) and protecting New Zealand's natural heritage (3/20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Jim Anderton's Progressives scored 60%.  Their strongest
commitments were on saving the oceans (14/20), protecting New
Zealand's natural heritage (17/20) and environmental leadership
(14/20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand First and the Maori Party scored far better than
expected given their voting record in Parliament, where both
parties have opposed environmental legislation.  New Zealand First
gained 76% and the Maori Party gained 87%.  Both parties scored
well on environmental leadership and the Maori Party scored the
best of any party on cleaning up New Zealand's water ways."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Greens scored the best of any political party and were the
only party to score 20/20 for tackling climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Cath Wallace on 04-463-5713(w) or 04-970-8696 (H).

	Greenpeace activists today shut down the Inghams/Harvey Farms feed mill in Hamilton, demanding that the Aussie owned poultry and feed company stop importing genetically engineered (GE) soy for animal feed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A brace of chicken suit clad activists climbed and perched atop
two 6-metre high tripods to block the entrance to the Inghams mill.
Another three climbers scaled the grain silos and hung a large
banner reading "Inghams - GE Feed Not Wanted!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgriQuality tests showed in June that Inghams soy meal is 85%
contaminated with Monsanto's GE soy (1) from the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inghams continue to ignore the public's wish for GE free food
(2)," said Greenpeace GE Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inghams soy is the single biggest source of GE contamination in
the New Zealand food chain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As a major animal feed supplier, through their subsidiary
Harvey Farms, Inghams GE soy fouls many sectors of the agricultural
industry that would otherwise be GE free," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 New Zealand's biggest importer of soy meal for feed,
Tegel/NRM shifted to a non-GE crops in feed policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's high-time that Inghams catch up to the non-GE standard
that Tegel has set for New Zealand poultry and stock feed," said
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In key export markets, such as Europe, there is an increasing
demand for non-GE fed animal produce such as meat and dairy. If soy
importers such as Inghams were to switch to non-GE soy, any
uncertainty about the GE feed status of New Zealand produce would
be eliminated," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing genetically engineered crops threatens conventional
production and the environment, and GE foods are insufficiently
tested and unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is launching its most ambitious ship-based campaign to save the world's oceans, which it says are at the "tipping point," with scores of fish, birds and mammals heading towards extinction.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza sets sail from Rotterdam harbour, The Netherlands  bound for Cape Town, South Africa where the organization is embarking on a major global oceans expedition.  Greenpeace is calling for a network of marine reserves which are needed to protect and restore the health of the world's oceans. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisation is calling on New Zealanders to join the push
to end whale hunting once and for all, and to set up a vast network
of marine reserves to protect and restore the health of the
oceans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world-wide Defending Our Oceans campaign was launched in
South Afric today (Friday). Two Greenpeace ships - the MY (motor
yacht) Esperanza and the MY Arctic Sunrise - leave Cape Town this
weekend to search for the Japanese whaling fleet that's heading for
the Southern Ocean. New Zealander Phil Lloyd is bosun on the
Esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand whales campaigner Pia Mancia said that
New Zealanders could be proud of their record in the campaign to
save the whales, but the fight wasn't won yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Using a loophole in the 1986 international moratorium on
commercial whaling which allows 'scientific' whaling, Japan intends
to kill nearly 1000 minke whales in the Southern Ocean whale
sanctuary, plus 50 fin and 50 humpback whales, which are both
endangered," she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Right now, Japan's whaling fleet is sailing south from Japan,
despite the fact that there is supposed to be an international ban
on commercial whaling. We are going to the Southern Ocean sanctuary
to defend the whales and to focus public support for an end to the
hunt, once and for all."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pia Mancia said that humankind's persecution of the great whales
- almost to the point of extinction - was just one example of the
enormous problems facing the world's oceans."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Every second breath we take comes from the oceans," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The oceans give the planet half of its oxygen, and in return we
suffocate them with pollution, warm them with climate change, and
empty them of fish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Countless factory ships scour and devour all life in their path
with destructive techniques like bottom trawling. The only way in
which to reverse the decline and guarantee healthy oceans in the
future is to establish and enforce a world-wide network of marine
reserves."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There would be many opportunities in the coming months for New
Zealanders to defend the oceans and protect the whales, she
said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;''It's been nearly half a century since New Zealanders stopped
hunting whales, and today we are among the most vocal supporters of
the international ban on whaling," she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"But if we are going to make any real headway in protecting the
health of our oceans and the planet, we have to make sure that all
marine species - including whales - are not under threat of
extinction."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Defending Our Oceans campaign will see the Esperanza (the
newest Greenpeace ship) spend 14 months sailing four of the world's
five oceans, highlighting the threats that they face and mapping
out a global network of marine reserves. Greenpeace plans to gather
one million ocean defenders - supporter who will join the call for
action to protect the oceans - during the course of the
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Zealanders can follow the campaign - including the progress
of the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise as they search for the
Japanese whaling fleet - at &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/"&gt;oceans.greenpeace.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; The 1986 international moratorium on commercial whaling, governed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) allows "scientific" whaling. Many reputable scientists have criticised the basis of Japan's "scientific" whaling, saying that the information could be gathered without killing the whales.

The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established by the IWC in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;

	The arrival of the Rainbow Warrior in Iceland today launched a public tour that will take the ship around the small North Atlantic Island. At the same time Greenpeace presented an offer to the Icelandic Government, giving them a chance to save their globally damaged reputation and the whales of the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace will be the link between people around the world and
the people of Iceland who want to protect this island's natural
resources. We will encourage our supporters and the general public
to actively choose Iceland as a nature based tourism destination in
the future", said Greenpeace spokesperson Frode Pleym at a press
conference onboard the Rainbow Warrior in Reykjavik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return, Greenpeace urge the Icelandic Government to stop the
current whale hunt of 38 minke whales, publicly agree that so
called "scientific whaling" will not resume at anytime, under any
guise and withdraw Iceland's reservation to the international ban
on commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Icelandic Government's attempt to justify whaling "on
scientific grounds" is economic suicide. Whale watching is now the
heart of an even larger nature tourism industry that is exceeded in
economic importance only by Iceland's fish based industries.
Already we see tourists cancelling trips to Iceland due to the
whale hunt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market for whale meat and blubber is not a lucrative option
to declining tourism. Viability of selling the whale blubber is
uncertain as the Icelandic domestic market is very small and the
only potential export market in Japan remains highly questionable.
(1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This clearly shows that there are no legitimate reasons for the
Icelandic Government to hunt whales. The argument that it is
necessary to control the minke whale stocks to safeguard cod, is
pseudo science and used by the Government to gain public
opinion".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior first sailed against Icelandic whaling on
her maiden voyage in 1978 when the world's largest mammal was on
the verge of extinction. Today seven of the 13 great whale species
are endangered, the remainder are still recovering from former
overexploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Rainbow Warrior tour 2003 is to engage in
dialogue with the people of Iceland to support and interact with
the existing local pressure on the Icelandic Government. If
international reaction is short lived the Icelandic Government will
proceed and pave the way for a resumption of full- scale commercial
whaling for export in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We offer to work with the people of Iceland towards a
future-oriented ecological society while the Icelandic Government
is holding their people hostage in an unsustainable tradition.
Whaling is part of Iceland's past and Iceland's future can only be
undermined by a renewed whale hunt", concluded Frode Pleym from
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Japanese consumer groups say studies by the National
Veterinary Institute in Oslo and the Norwegian College of
Veterinary Medicine have found the average concentration of PCBs in
north-east Atlantic minke whales to be 3.8 parts per million (ppm).
The provisional regulatory standard for PCBs in marine products in
Japan is much lower, at 0.5 ppm…"&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace says outrage by the United States over North Korea's underground testing of a nuclear weapon is hypocritical given that country's nuclear arsenal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Nobody wants yet another country to have nuclear weapons, but
with over 5,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenal of the United States
of America, the relative balance of power has to be kept in mind,"
says Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace Campaign manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States maintains nuclear missile carrying submarines
in the Pacific at all times, in addition to maintaining
nuclear-armed bombers at bases around the world, including the
Pacific island of Guam, and intercontinental missiles in silos in
the United States. All are capable of reaching North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea apparently does not have a reliable delivery system
for nuclear weapons. The most recent test (July 2006) of a longer
range missile was a failure, with the missile breaking apart early
in its flight. During a previous test over the Pacific, the missile
also broke up in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'It would have been appropriate for the US and Chinese
governments to announce that they would ratify the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) that has been around since September 1996,'
says Ms Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annex 2 to the Treaty contains the list of signatories that need
to ratify for it to enter into force. Most of them have now
ratified, with the exception of China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia,
Iran, Israel, and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace condemned the test, saying that Pyongyang has
underscored the dangerous connection between nuclear research,
nuclear power and nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'By testing a nuclear weapon, North Korea has also highlighted
the weakness of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has become
the ninth country to have a nuclear arsenal," says Cindy
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

	The decision by Iceland to grant a commercial license to hunt whales makes no economic sense and should be revoked immediately, Greenpeace said today.

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iceland has no market for whale meat, but they do have a huge
and far more valuable market for whale watching, " said Greenpeace
whales campaigner Jo McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision is the result of a campaign by one man, Kristjan
Loftsson, a former whaler, who has collected 250 million ISK in
shares for renovating his whaling station in Hvalfjordur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Instead of investing in a one-man campaign to rejuvenate an
outdated, unnecessary industry, that can only damage the reputation
of the country internationally, Iceland should be capitalising on
the value of a growing industry of watching and studying whales,"
said McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that Iceland's claims that the hunt is sustainable has
no credibility, since nine of the 39 whales that are to be targeted
are endangered Fin whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace called on the New Zealand Government to bring renewed
pressure on Iceland and to protest the whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jo McVeagh said Mr. Loftsson's shareholders are likely to be
bitterly disappointed. Not only do Icelanders widely oppose his
whaling, it is also very unprofitable due to disappearing markets
for whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the facts: In Iceland only 1.1% of the population eat
whale meat once a week and 82% of 16 to 24 year olds have never
eaten it (1). So called 'scientific' catches, of about 40 minkes a
year, have flooded the market in Iceland. The fin whales Mr
Loftsson hopes to catch are almost ten times as big as minkes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Norway the Raw Fish Marketing Board closed the whale hunt in
August, 2006, before it had reached half its quota, because they
had enough whale meat to supply the demand in Norway for the year.
And in Japan, thousands of tonnes of whale meat is stockpiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will continue to work with those communities in
Iceland who oppose whaling, particularly people in the tourism
industry who recognise that this is bad for Iceland's international
reputation. Greenpeace has tens of thousands of names of people who
would visit Iceland as tourists if whaling were to end, and would
be glad to hand them over when whaling stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) IFAW poll in Iceland, 12 September 2006. Photos of 2003 Icelandic whaling available &lt;/p&gt;

Stewardship Council) green label, or ask for 'Ecotimber' from
community management forestry operations in the Pacific. At the
bare minimum consumers should ask for proof of legality when they
are buying any product made of wood," explained Grant Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on the New Zealand government to immediately
stop the imports of illegal wood products such as kwila decking or
outdoor furniture, and to adopt border controls that prevent
illegal wood coming into New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How is it that this government can turn a blind eye to these
illegal imports - further fuelling forest loss in PNG and
Indonesia? If it was illegal cars or electronic gear the government
would act but in this case with wood they are sitting on their
hands," said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ministry of Forestry statistics the imports of
wooden furniture have increased four fold in recent years to a
value of over $150 million annually. With much of the forests of
Asia Pacific already logged or cleared, the remaining large area
where illegal logging is now focused is on the island of New
Guinea, which also happens to be the source of much of New
Zealand's imported tropical wood, such as kwila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Kwila is becoming increasing threatened by a rapacious logging
industry, to a point that the Indonesian government is proposing to
list kwila on Appendix 3 of the CITES (Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species)," said Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank recently reported 70% and 70-80% illegal logging
rates for PNG and Indonesia respectively, as well as illegal
logging of public forests costing US$15 billion annually in lost
revenue, assets and tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today launched the Big Switch online competition designed to encourage householders to help stop climate change by making the switch to a cleaner electricity company in their area. Prizes are a solar water heater, a mountain bike and a nifty little portable solar charger.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Climate Change campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson says the
Big Switch competition aims to raise awareness that electricity
used at home can have a direct impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to generate
electricity contributes to climate change - which is the greatest
threat we face. However using clean, renewable energy like wind and
solar does not produce greenhouse gas pollution. Everyday New
Zealanders can be part of the solution by choosing clean energy
using the Clean Energy Guide," said Climate Change campaigner,
Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Big Switch competition (1) gives people twice the incentive
to switch to clean energy. Consumers not only  have the
satisfaction of taking action on climate change by switching, but
they can also win climate-friendly prizes like a solar water heater
or a mountain bike and become more aware of the solutions in the
process."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These great prizes help lower your impact on the climate and
save you money. A solar water heater could save your household
between $350 and $450 a year, and lower demand for electricity. The
mountain bike could save on travel costs and on carbon emissions
and it's good for your health! The solar charger means you can
charge gadgets like your ipod or mobile using only the power of the
sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrants in the competition get extra chances to win for each
one of their friends or family who they tell about the competition
and who then enter. So help spread the word about clean energy and
climate solutions and be in to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition uses Greenpeace's Clean Energy Guide which ranks
electricity companies on their impact on the climate now and in the
future by examining how they currently generate electricity, and
what their energy policies are for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst climate offenders are in the red at the top of the
thermometer - because of their contribution to climate change and
the cleanest electricity providers are at the bottom in the green
(2). The ranking is based on climate impacts and not on other
environmental issues, and is not an endorsement of any company
(3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate and energy issues are high on the public agenda with
scientists issuing more and more dire warnings about climate change
and the Government reviewing its climate and energy policies this
year," says Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;UPDATE: The Big Switch is now closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; NOTES

	Greenpeace NZ welcomes the Australian Government announcement calling for the United Nations to take measures to stop bottom trawling in international waters and says it's a shame New Zealand has been left behind.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Australia has taken a leadership role to negotiate a meaningful
outcome at the United Nations that secures the protection of
deep-sea life in international waters," said Bunny McDiarmid,
Executive Director of Greenpeace NZ. "Both Australia and Palau lead
the world with the positions they will take to the UN next
week."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately New Zealand's main weakness is in regard to areas
of international waters where fisheries management is under
negotiation. In these areas our Government calls for measures by
2008 &amp;amp;#150; without specifying which month or what kind of
measures - and doesn't stipulate that a moratorium on bottom
trawling in international waters will come in place if the deadline
is not met," said McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In contrast, Australia wants measures in place by 31 July 2007
or an interim ban will apply. Palau requires an immediate
prohibition on bottom trawling in these areas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Basically, the New Zealand Government is pushing for a larger
timeframe that would allow bottom trawlers to keep destroying deep
sea life in international waters for longer".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Australian Government is now clearly acknowledging the
destructive environmental impacts of bottom trawling, the need for
immediate action and the need for long-term protection and genuine
sustainable management," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a shame the New Zealand's Government's actions aren't as
strong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following three years of urgent calls to action, the United
Nations General Assembly will finally begin negotiating measures to
protect marine life in the deep-sea on 4-5 October leading to a
formal adoption of measures in November. A number of countries are
already committed to supporting a UN moratorium and include Brazil,
Chile, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, the United Kingdom, South
Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia,
the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Vanuatu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have only just started to explore the complex world
far beneath the surface of the oceans, discovering new species and
ancient coral reefs.  Bottom trawling is widely recognized as the
most destructive of fishing methods. Heavily weighted bottom trawls
are indiscriminate and scour and devour everything in their path.
Their use has been compared to clearfelling a native forest to
catch all the tui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1500 marine scientists form over 60 countries have
signed a letter to support an immediate UN moratorium on bottom
trawling in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand public should be alarmed at the Government's lack of urgency on climate change, Greenpeace said today in response to climate change Minister David Parker's announcement on the issue.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Everyone's talking about the need to make major reductions of
greenhouse gases. The acid test is whether the policies deliver the
cuts in emissions needed to avoid dangerous levels on climate
change.  But the Government isn't talking targets at all,' said
Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace campaign manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is extremely worried at Mr Parker's caution that the
pace and extent of New Zealand's response 'should be in step with
what major emitters are doing, including major trading
partners.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Mr Parker needs to state which major trading partners he wants
to be in step with: George Bush's America or the European Union and
Japan,' said Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'New Zealanders are heavy greenhouse polluters. We are also
relatively wealthy. If New Zealand refuses to lead, we can hardly
expect emerging economies (including China and India) to take
action ' particularly when on a per capita basis they are poorer
and less polluting than New Zealand.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Parker also signalled that price-based measures across the
New Zealand economy may not be in place until as far away as 2012,
again, a weakening of the Government's previous stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Government is about to publish a study by former World
Bank economist, Sir Nicholas Stern, which will warn that the world
may have to pay multi-trillion dollar economic costs if it does not
move urgently to act on climate change and that developed economies
will face far higher costs if they do not act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The economic costs of inaction on climate change are never
factored into Government accounting, and it's time they were,' said
Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of concern was Mr Parker's signal that New Zealand was
interested in the 'Asia-Pacific Pact' (AP6), which Greenpeace has
re-named the 'Coal Pact' on account of the idea coming from the
coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The Coal Pact is a voluntary, underfunded talkfest which is a
US and Australian-led effort to delay real action.  Under this
pact, the member countries will increase their emission by 100% by
2050,' said Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

	Actress Sigourney Weaver today joined a coalition representing more than 60 conservation organizations from around the world at United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York to call for new action to confront lawless bottom trawling in deep sea fisheries, a practice scientists say is destroying some of the world's rarest and most sensitive ocean habitats.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;span class="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sigourney Weaver at the UN Press Briefing in New York demonstrates the state of the sea bed before and after a bottom trawl.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event, sponsored by the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition
(DSCC), comes a day before representatives of UN member states
gather to negotiate protections for vanishing deep sea ecosystems.
The groups say delegates are under unprecedented pressure to tackle
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'This may be the last chance we have to save some of the earth's
most vital and important ecosystems,' Weaver said Tuesday. 'The
natural treasures of the deepest ocean are being levelled by
trawling, devastating areas of importance to all humankind. The
international community simply must step up and act.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action by the General Assembly (GA) had been delayed pending the
outcome of a review by members of the GA of measures already
taken.  The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, published a report
summarising such measures in July 2006 and concluded that little
had been done to protect vulnerable deep sea ecosystems on the high
seas.  It found that: 'Many fisheries are not managed until they
are over-exploited and clearly depleted and, because of the high
vulnerability of deep-sea species to exploitation and their low
potential for recovery, this is of particular concern for these
stocks. This raises the question of the urgent need for interim
measures in particular circumstances, pending the adoption of
conservation and management regimes.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling for a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling, the DSCC
and Weaver were joined by the UN Ambassadors from Australia, and
Palau, who are championing new protections, and Ellen Pikitch, the
executive director of the Pew Institute for Ocean Science at the
University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The UN has been debating this issue for three years while the
problem keeps getting worse,' said Lisa Speer of the Natural
Resource Defense Council (NRDC), a DSCC member. 'Fleets ply vast
areas of open ocean beyond the reach of any national jurisdiction,
and they are doing irreparable damage to some of the oldest and
most unique ecosystems on earth.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high seas cover more than half the planet's surface,
constituting a global commons that is increasingly recognized as a
priceless reservoir of biodiversity. Scientists probing
once-unreachable depths in recent years have discovered sprawling
coral reefs, and chemical compounds that hold promise for the
treatment of human diseases like cancer and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen Sack of Greenpeace International, also a member of the
DSCC, added, 'The UN has the power to protect the remarkable life
in the deep sea from the relentless march of bottom trawlers. If it
fails to act, it would be allowing these unknown worlds to be
destroyed before we fully understand all the life they contain'like
blowing up Mars before we get there.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary cold and depth of the high seas means that
marine species grow and reproduce much more slowly than in warmer
coastal seas. Instead of life cycles that span a few months or
years, deep-sea fish like orange roughy can live 125 years. Deep
water coral reefs can live for eight thousand years. Scientists
warn these slow-growing species cannot readily recover from
over-fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil, the UK, South Africa, Australia, Chile, France, Norway,
the Netherlands, Germany and many Pacific Island nations are among
those that have called for a halt to unregulated high seas bottom
trawling.  Spain, Russia and Iceland lead the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday Sept 30, US Senators Ted Stevens along with 20 other
senior members of Congress introduced a resolution calling on the
UN to stop unregulated destructive fishing practices on the high
seas. "We hope the US Administration will follow suit by stepping
up to lead the fight to stop unregulated high seas bottom
trawling," said Lisa Speer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week's negotiations will effectively determine how the UN
GA will decide the issue when it meets in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DSCC is a Coalition of over 60 conservation and
environmental organizations around the world, calling for a
moratorium (interim prohibition) on high seas bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; Notes: Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation with offices in 40 countries around the world that uses non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems to drive solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment. Founded in 1970, NRDC has 1.2 million members and online activists nationwide, served from offices in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is astounded that a State Owned Enterprise would try to hit the organisation for a huge bill of over $14,000 in court costs, for an appeal over Mighty River Power's plans to fire up Marsden B power station on coal.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mighty River filed an application for costs in the Environment
Court at the end of last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are shocked that Mighty River would stoop so low and to
resort to such bullying tactics to try to shut down dissent when
public interest in climate change is so high on the agenda," said
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace recently took Mighty River to the Environment Court
arguing that the effects of Marsden B on climate change needed to
be considered in the resource consent process. The Environment
Court ruled against Greenpeace and Greenpeace has appealed it to
the High Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005 Mighty River attempted to slap a massive $19,089.89 for
security costs on the four activists who occupied the roof of
Marsden B Power station for nine days in February of that year. It
was rejected by the District Court Judge in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a shame that Mighty River feels, once again, that it
needs to attempt to silence dissent on its dirty project, by
hitting us with costs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is widespread public opposition to Mighty River's proposal
to fire up New Zealand's first major coal fired power station in 25
years, as seen by over 3,000 submissions against it. The
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has criticised the
proposal for undermining New Zealand's attempts to reduce
greenhouse emissions. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy,
David Parker, has also pointed out that the project may not be
viable if a price on carbon dioxide was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; History of Marsden B
In September 2005, Mighty River Power, a Government owned power company, was granted a resource consent by the Northland Regional Council to build New Zealand's first major coal fired power station in over 25 years.

In October 2005, Greenpeace and other community groups lodged an appeal to the Environment Court.

In February 2006, Mighty River Power called for proceedings in the overall appeal to be put on hold while it negotiated access to Department of Conservation land. Another hearing date has yet to be set.

Also in February 2006 Mighty River Power submitted to the Environment Court that climate change could not be considered in the overall appeal.

On July 11th 2006 the Environment Court made its decision regarding the relevance of climate change to the overall appeal.

On August 3rd 2006 Greenpeace appealed the decision on climate change to the High Court

The overall appeal, including concerns about mercury, dioxin and sulphur dioxide still stands, but remains on hold pending Mighty River's application for access to DOC land.&lt;/p&gt;

	Japan and the whaling lobby have finally gained a simple majority vote at the IWC. The IWC passed by one vote (1) a declaration (2) that the "IWC has failed to meet its obligations..." its commitments to "normalizing the functions of the IWC..." in support of commercial whaling.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The justification for the declaration - that whales consume so
much fish that they are a threat to food security for coastal
nations - was patently absurd, said Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is disgusted that any member of the IWC would seek
to promote whaling through this Japanese-promoted declaration",
said Jo McVeagh, whales campaigner for Greenpeace NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For millions of years fish and whales have coexisted quite
happily. In recent years vast armadas of factory fishing fleets
have collapsed global fish populations. Drift nets, bottom trawling
and long lines have taken a huge toll in wiping out ocean life over
our lifetimes".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Blaming whales for collapsing fisheries is like blaming
woodpeckers for deforestation." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legitimacy of the vote remains in serious question. A number
of countries, including New Zealand, have tabled serious
reservations and disassociated themselves from the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first significant vote that Japan has won at the IWC
in the past 20 years. In reality, this declaration will change
little or nothing. Previous votes over recent days have already
rejected attempts by the whalers to agree resolutions to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;end any consideration by the IWC of protection for small
cetaceans,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bring in secret ballots,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;allow Japan an exception to the commercial moratorium to hunt
Minke and Brydes whales in its territorial waters and ,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;end the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"After the last whaling season which ended in March, the five
Japanese companies which own the whaling fleet announced they would
divest their share to the Government's Institute for Cetacean
Research. There is no commercial market for whale meat in Japan.
The notion that whaling is vital to cultural heritage, food
security and poverty is absurd," said Jo McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) THE VOTING LIST

EMPHASIZING that the use of cetaceans in many parts of the world including the Caribbean, contributes to sustainable coastal communities, sustainable livelihoods, food security and poverty reduction and that placing the use of whales outside the context of the globally accepted norm of science-based management and rule-making for emotional reasons would set a bad precedent that risks our use of fisheries and other renewable resources;

FURTHER EMPHAZING that the use of marine resources as an integral part of development options is critically important at this time for a number of countries experiencing the need to diversify their agriculture;

UNDERSTANDING that the purpose of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) is to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry" (quoted from the Preamble to the Convention) and that the International Whaling Commission (IWC) is therefore about managing whaling to ensure whale stocks are not over-harvested rather than protecting all whales irrespective of their abundance;

NOTING that in 1982 the IWC adopted a moratorium on commercial whaling (paragraph 10e of the Schedule to the ICRW) without advice from the Commission's Scientific Committee that such measure was required for conservation purposes;

FURTHER NOTING that the moratorium which was clearly intended as a temporary measure is no longer necessary, that the Commission adopted a robust and risk-averse procedure (RMP) for calculating quotas for abundant stocks of baleen whales in 1994 and that the IWC's own Scientific Committee has agreed that many species and stocks of whales are abundant and sustainable whaling is possible;

CONCERNED that after 14 years of discussion and negotiation, the IWC has failed to complete and implement a management regime to regulate commercial whaling;

ACCEPTING that scientific research has shown that whales consume huge quantities of fish making the issue a matter of food security for coastal nations and requiring that the issue of management of whale stocks must be considered in a broader context of ecosystem management since eco-system management has now become an international standard;

REJECTING as unacceptable that a number of international NGOs with self-interest campaigns should use threats in an attempt to direct government policy on matters of sovereign rights related to the use of resources for food security and national development;

NOTING that the position of some members that are opposed to the resumption of commercial whaling on a sustainable basis irrespective of the status of whale stocks is contrary to the object and purpose of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling;

UNDERSTANDING that the IWC can be saved from collapse only by implementing conservation and management measures which will allow controlled and sustainable whaling which would not mean a return to historic over-harvesting and that continuing failure to do so serves neither the interests of whale conservation nor management;

NOW THEREFORE:

* COMMISSIONERS express their concern that the IWC has failed to meet its obligations under the terms of the ICRW and,

* DECLARE our commitment to normalize the functions of the IWC based on the terms of the ICRW and other relevant international law, respect for cultural diversity and traditions of coastal peoples and the fundamental principles of sustainable use of resources, and the need for science-based policy and rulemaking that are accepted as the world standard for the management of marine resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            17-Jan-06 On Mission Bay beach in Auckland, NZ Greenpeace supporters take symbolic action against Japan's whaling in the Souther Ocean
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan and other countries in favour of whaling lost the first
vote by 31 against, 30 in favour and four abstentions and then
withdrew the second. For any actual whale quota to be awarded they
would have required a three quarter majority, however, even if they
had only a simple majority over 50%, they would have used this to
say the IWC supported a return to commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the closest those in support of whaling have ever come
to achieving a majority on such a vote which has been pushed every
year for the last couple of decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan is now down three votes for three. But the margin was
again too close for comfort. Extra countries have turned up since
the first day and are voting with Japan. Another close call and
another victory for the whales," said Jo McVeagh, whales campaigner
for Greenpeace NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the vote gap closing and three days to go the remainder of
the meeting is difficult to predict. It is still possible that
Japan will muster a last minute majority in order to push for the
withdrawal of Greenpeace's observer status, table a motion
endorsing its scientific whaling and call for the abolition of the
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary," warned McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

Due to relentless campaigning by lots of different people, Mighty River Power's Marsden B coal fired power station proposal was abandoned in March 2007.


Greenpeace announced today it has lodged an appeal to the High Court, against a decision by the Environment Court last month that the effects of discharges from the proposed Marsden B coal power station on climate change could not be considered at all.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist Gareth Moon on his second day at their rooftop occupation camp on the Marsden B power station in Ruakaka. They are protesting against Mighty River Power's proposal to convert the plant into a coal fired powerstation that would pump up to 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. This would nearly double New Zealand's carbon dioxide emissions from coal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a test case on climate change in New Zealand. It would
be a disaster in terms of our nation's response to the greatest
threat facing the planet - climate change, if the first major
coal-fired power station in this country in 25 years could go ahead
without any consideration of its effects on climate change at any
stage in the decision making process," said Greenpeace campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists warn that we have ten years to act to avoid the most
dangerous impacts of climate change, a problem which scientists
agree is caused mainly by carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and
gas for our energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Resource Management Act (RMA) was amended in 2004 to remove
regional councils' ability to directly manage and regulate
greenhouse emissions. However Greenpeace argued that the RMA still
provides for climate change to be considered through the benefits
of renewable energy development in reducing climate change
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace submitted to the Environment Court that Marsden B
will shut out renewable energy sources, which otherwise would have
lowered greenhouse pollution, so climate change does need to be
considered to that extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Court did not agree and held that Greenpeace
could not make that argument in court. Greenpeace has appealed that
decision to the High Court. There are 10 working days for other
parties to express interest in the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how New Zealand deals with climate change is an
issue of hot debate and this appeal to the High Court adds to that.
The Government is currently reviewing its climate change policies
and there is a bill being considered by Select Committee at the
moment to make it clear that climate change and renewable energy
must be considered at a regional as well as a national level.
Greenpeace made a submission to the Committee in support of the
bill last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we need now are policies to lower our emissions, encourage
renewable technology such as wind farms, stop climate-polluting
power sources such as Marsden B, phase out coal and increase energy
efficiency to lead us to a 100% renewable electricity sector,"
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marsden B would annually release up to 2.17 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide and present risks to human health and the
environment from mercury, dioxin and sulphur emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Marsden B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2005, Mighty River Power, a Government owned power
company, was granted a resource consent by the Northland Regional
Council to build New Zealand's first major coal fired power station
in over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2005, Greenpeace and other community groups lodged an
appeal to the Environment Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2006, Mighty River Power called for proceedings in
the overall appeal to be put on hold while it negotiated access to
Department of Conservation land. Another hearing date has yet to be
set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in February 2006 Mighty River Power submitted to the
Environment Court that climate change could not be considered in
the overall appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 11th 2006 the Environment Court made its decision
regarding the relevance of climate change to the overall
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 3rd 2006 Greenpeace appealed the decision on climate
change to the High Court&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall appeal, including concerns about mercury, dioxin and
sulphur dioxide still stands, but remains on hold pending MRP's
application for access to DOC land.&lt;/p&gt;

	Early today, Greenpeace activists locked themselves to a high seas bottom trawler to prevent it from leaving Port Nelson. Four activists boarded the Chang Xing, locking themselves to the mast and other parts of the vessel.

&lt;div&gt;
	

&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/image/2006/11/nelson-30-july-2006-greenpeac.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Nelson 30-July-2006: Greenpeace activists block the trawl ramp of Belize flagged Chinese bottom trawler Chang Xing in Port Nelson, New Zealand. Two other activists climbed the mast and along with one other attached to the mooring line stopped the vessel from leaving port. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blocking the Chang Xing's departure, Greenpeace also locked
metal braces and a large sculpture of a deep-sea coral to the
vessel's stern as a reminder of the deep sea life being destroyed
daily by high seas bottom trawlers. They tied a banner to the stern
with the words 'The trawl's in your court NZ'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've done what the Government should be doing: taking strong
action against bottom trawlers who are destroying unique deep-sea
life out in international waters", said Greenpeace oceans
campaigner Mike Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior previously encountered the Chinese bottom
trawler, Chang Xing, in international waters of the Tasman Sea in
2004. Greenpeace exposed the damage caused by dragging heavy bottom
trawl nets across the sea floor by filming and photographing the
Chang Xing's crew dump large quantities of unwanted species
including lantern sharks, squid, deep-sea kina and endangered black
coral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November this year, the UN will make final decisions about
whether to impose a moratorium on bottom trawling in international
waters to halt destruction until scientists can document the areas
that need protection and governments can develop the ways and means
to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the issue was first raised two years ago, a significant
number of Governments have come forward to support a moratorium,
like the UK, Brazil, Germany and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand now needs to come forward and live up to our clean,
green reputation on the international political stage - we can and
we should now support the moratorium."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that the UK's Fisheries Minister, Ben Bradshaw,
recently told a global conference of marine scientists he wants to
see an end to destructive deep-sea bottom trawling, and called on
governments to take urgent global action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A timely incentive for today's Greenpeace action against the
Chang Xing came from a UN report released two weeks ago (1), which
stated that governments have done nothing to protect deep-sea
biodiversity from destructive fishing in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UN's Oceans Division report confirmed what we've known all
along," Hagler added: "he survival of the countless species found
in the deep sea is jeopardised by bottom trawlers like the Chang
Xing. This gives New Zealand the opportunity to follow our own
policies for biodiversity protection and move with the leaders of
the advancing tide of international opinion in support of the
moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's intolerable that the Chang Xing and a few hundred other
bottom trawlers - including some from New Zealand - can get away
with bulldozing vulnerable habitats and species to oblivion in the
unregulated high seas. Unless this practice is halted, we could
lose species and deep-sea habitats forever," Hagler said. "A UN
moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters is the only
effective solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The Report was ordered by the United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) in 2004 and was conducted by the UN Oceans Division
known by its acronym DOALOS. It is based on submissions from member
states reporting on what they have done individually, and as
members of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), to
stop destructive fishing practices - including bottom trawling - on
the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It concluded that: "Many fisheries are not managed until they
are overexploited and clearly depleted and, because of the high
vulnerability of deep-sea species to exploitation and their low
potential for recovery, this is of particular concern for these
stocks. This raises the question of the urgent need for interim
measures in particular circumstances, pending the adoption of
conservation and management regimes."&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand fishing industry's proposal to close some areas of the sea around New Zealand to bottom trawling does little to stop the destruction of vulnerable deep-sea life threatened by the practice, a map released by Greenpeace shows.

        &lt;p&gt;
            Map of areas proposed by the NZ fishing industry to be closed to bottom trawling compared to where bottom trawling actually occurs.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has taken a Ministry of Fisheries 'trawling map'
which shows where the fishing industry has been bottom trawling
(1), and overlaid it over the fishing industry's map of its
proposed closures (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map shows that most areas proposed for closure are either
too deep or too rough to bottom trawl, or are otherwise of no
interest to the fishing industry because they don't have enough
bottom-trawled target fish, such as orange roughy, to be economical
as fishing areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace map coincides with the recent publication of a
NIWA report, commissioned by the Department of Conservation, which
also criticises the fishing industry closure proposal and says
that, under the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;protection for endemic species protection would be very low&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"...despite their large geographic area, the focus of this
proposal on existing areas that have both very low fishing value
and low fish diversity, makes it a poor option for the long-term
protection of demersal fish diversity in New Zealand's EEZ."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But as Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton has repeatedly stressed,
decisions about areas closed to bottom trawling need to be based on
science. Greenpeace welcomes science-based industry initiatives to
close areas to bottom trawling too. But now we have the scientists
and their maps saying that this proposal to close one-third of New
Zealand waters to bottom trawling does nothing to protect what's
being destroyed," said Mike Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry's approach of volunteering to close some of New
Zealand waters to bottom trawling is also being promoted as a way
of protecting vulnerable deep-sea life found in international
waters, where the use of the destructive fishing practice is
increasing worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, there is even less science about deep sea life
in international waters than within New Zealand waters. That's why
we are urging New Zealand to support a United Nations moratorium on
bottom trawling in international waters in November. It will keep
out bottom trawlers until scientists research which areas need
permanent protection, and governments work out the ways and means
to protect them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum is building internationally, with a band of Pacific
nations, the UK, Chile, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Denmark and
Sweden, among many others, leading progress internationally towards
November's vote on a bottom trawling moratorium in international
waters at the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand needs to stand with these leading countries at the
UN and help bring other countries onboard", concluded Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) "Trawling on or near the sea bed during the 1990s," Ministry of Fisheries, &lt;a href="http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Environmental/default.htm"&gt;http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Environmental/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand marked World Oceans Day by hanging a large banner across the front of Wellington Railway Station during the morning commuter rush with a message to the Government: "Time is Running Out - Stop Deep-Sea Destruction"
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Three climbers scaled the Railway Station with the banner, while
commuters walked past sculptures of tree-like corals and weird and
wonderful deep-sea creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past three years, Greenpeace has been exposing the
destruction of bottom trawlers - including New Zealand vessels - in
international waters. Over this time Greenpeace has reiterated that
'urgent action' is needed to protect the deep-sea life that
scientists say are being pushed to extinction before they are even
named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The only effective action is a United Nations moratorium on
bottom trawling in international waters, but the New Zealand
Government's approach has so far been weak and is a hindrance to
progress at the UN," says oceans campaigner Mike Hagler. "Instead
of leading the push for a UN moratorium, as our Government did with
high seas drift netting in 1989, New Zealand is dawdling in the
face of extinctions in the deep sea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many countries see New Zealand as a global leader on
environmental issues. Without clear and vocal support, the wrong
signal is being sent to other countries that are also sitting on
the fence. New Zealand needs to actively support the proposal with
the intention of bringing other countries with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed UN moratorium on high seas bottom trawling has the
support of the world's scientific community and now 30 countries,
including Sweden, Germany, Indonesia and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every four seconds marine life in an area of ocean floor the
size of ten football fields is wiped out by bottom trawlers in
international waters. We want an approach that prevents the
irreversible impacts of bottom trawling and protects vulnerable
habitats, rather than trawl now, think later."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there are about 250-300 high seas bottom trawlers -
including about two dozen New Zealand trawlers. This is only 0.3
percent of the three million commercial fishing boats worldwide,
and only 0.2 percent of global marine fisheries production. The
overall contribution of high seas bottom trawling to global food
security is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge bottom trawl nets are bulldozed along the seabed taking all
fish, smashing ancient corals and destroying the other marine life
that has taken thousands of years to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our message to Government is that time is running out for
deep-sea life threatened by bottom trawling in international
waters. A temporary halt to the practice, imposed by the UN, would
buy time to put in place policies and regulations for long-term
protection of deep-sea life".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before World Oceans Day ends, a global fleet of around 300 high
seas bottom trawlers will have dragged their heavy nets across an
estimated 1,500 km2 of deep-seabed.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace breathed a sigh of relief for the whales as pro-whaling nations led by Japan failed to gain a majority during the opening day of the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) annual meeting, in St Kitts. The international environmental organisation announced  that it intends to return to the Southern Ocean this year to oppose Japan's continued 'scientific hunt' which will target 935 minke whales and ten endangered fin whales, warning that there is no cause for complacency.

            Two humpback whales breaching.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first vote on the opening day of the Conference,
Japan called to have any reference for a discussion on conservation
of small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) to be struck from the
agenda. The motion was defeated 32 votes to 30. The second and
deciding vote on Japan's call for secret ballots was defeated by 33
votes to 30. This means the whalers have stumbled but not fallen,
in their bid to take over the IWC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite today's won votes, Greenpeace could still be
expelled from the IWC on Sunday night (NZ time) due to a situation
set up by the Japanese whaling fleet 6 months ago in the Southern
Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whalers rammed the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise six
months ago in the Southern Ocean, then blamed it on Greenpeace. On
Sunday the Japanese delegation will accuse Greenpeace of
'interfering with research vessels' in an attempt to revoke our
observer status" said Jo McVeagh, Whale campaigner for Greenpeace
NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years Japan has been trying overturn the 1986 IWC moratorium
on commercial whaling. It has been accused of buying votes in
exchange for foreign aid for fisheries given to many countries who
they have encouraged to become IWC members and who supported the
pro-whaling position. Having failed to win the majority at last
years meeting, one of the Japanese delegation made their intentions
clear: "The reversal of history, the turning point is soon to
come." &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This years meeting has been too close for comfort so Greenpeace
will once again head down to the Southern Ocean to challenge
'scientific' whaling by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Fisheries Agency of Japan", said Shane Rattenbury, head of
the Greenpeace International Oceans Campaign from St Kitts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the tensions at the IWC it is clear that the Fisheries
Agency of Japan do not enjoy the support of the Japanese people. In
a new poll commissioned by Greenpeace from the Nippon Research
Center, 77% of respondents said they do not support whaling on the
high seas such as the Antarctic Sea. &lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that the people of Japan do not support their
Fisheries Agency's drive to bring about a return to commercial
whaling. The people of Japan have no appetite for the Japanese
Government's sushi science," said Jo McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The whale hunt is bankrupt on all counts: politically,
financially, morally, ecologically and scientifically. For twenty
years the Government of Japan has kept the whaling fleet on life
support under the guise of science, it's time to face the fact that
the whaling industry is dead in the water. It is time to stop the
hunt," says McVeagh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a simple majority at the Commission, Japan would not have
been able to overturn the commercial moratorium on whaling but it
could have wreaked havoc with the IWC's measure to protect
whales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) The return to the Southern Ocean will bring full circle the most ambitious ship expedition Greenpeace has ever undertaken. Defending Our Oceans is a 15-month expedition to highlight the range of threats to the oceans and calling for a network of marine reserves covering 40% of the world's oceans. It began in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in November 2005 and has since exposed pirate fishing in West Africa, shown the benefits of 'no take' zones in the whale watching waters of the Azores and is currently exposing the critical state of tuna stocks in the Mediterranean.

Over the 73 days from November 20th 2005, 57 crew from over 20 countries onboard the Greenpeace ships MY Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise travelled 14,500 nautical miles, spent 28 days in contact with the whaling fleet, including 12 days when no whales where killed. Sadly, and despite saving a great many whales by blocking the harpooners shot, they witnessed the brutal death of at least 123 minke whales.

	While it is good to see the New Zealand Government taking up the global issue of bottom trawling, their position needs to be strengthened to protect deep sea life in international waters according to Greenpeace, Forest and Bird, and ECO.

            12-06-2005, West Norfolk Ridge, international waters Tasman Sea: Crewman on the New Zealand bottom trawler Waipori dump a large piece of 'Paragorgia' coral dredged from the deep sea in their net.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2004, the United Nations gave the world two years to take
urgent action on this issue, and for the New Zealand Government to
now demand another two years is absurd. 2008 is too long to wait,"
says Mike Hagler Greenpeace oceans campaigner, "Their proposal
allows two more years to plunder and destroy what they can".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What the Government has put forward is not bold - it will only
advocate to protect one third of international waters at the UN.
For the other two-thirds, the Government is allowing a loophole big
enough to drag a bottom trawl net through," said Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want to see New Zealand and Australia take leadership roles
at the UN negotiating table. They need to propose a moratorium on
bottom trawling in international waters that is immediate,
comprehensive and effective and oppose any loopholes," Hagler
added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to see New Zealand left behind", said Kirstie
Knowles of Forest and Bird. "Yesterday, Kenya and Cambodia pledged
their support for a moratorium, joining many other countries
including Brazil, the UK, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, Indonesia,
Chile and Pacific nations".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UNGA Secretary General report in July stated that Regional
Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOS) had failed over the past
two years to take the urgent action necessary to protect deep sea
life in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our government is relying on RFMOs to get the job done, when it
is clear that they are failing to protect deep sea life," added
Knowles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand position that Ministers announced today is
weak, and a weak starting point is a slippery slope. At UN
negotiations it is essential to start from a position of strength
than a position of weakness," said Barry Weeber of ECO. "The sooner
we get a moratorium on bottom trawling in international waters, the
sooner the destruction of ancient coral forests and the unknown
worlds of the deep will be protected."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Allowing two more years for RFMOs under negotiation to take
action will further put the negotiations in the hands of fisheries
agencies and proposals from the fishing industry for unscientific
'conservation' publicity proposals. Scientists are saying deep sea
species are being pushed to extinction before they are even named.
There are no second chances with extinction," concluded Weeber.&lt;/p&gt;

            Flooding in the central North Island.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a sad day for New Zealand when we are subjected to the
type of tactics endorsed by a Republician memo on how to confuse
the public on the science, to allow the burning of fossil fuels,"
says Greenpeace Climate Change campaigner, Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memo states: "Should the public come to believe the
scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming
will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make
the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate."
&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a well known strategy by vested interests to cast doubt
on the climate science. But the debate is over. The scientific
majority agrees - climate change is happening and it is caused by
human activities. What we are seeing in the formation of the
Climate Science Coalition is the death throes of the climate change
sceptic," Ms Atkinson says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) for our energy
needs, produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is one of the major
contributors to climate change. Those that stand to lose the most
require a debate to encourage uncertainty to protect their
interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Exxon-Mobil, the biggest oil company in the world,
has spent more than NZD$18.8 million funding groups and climate
sceptics to challenge the science of climate change.
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Exxon-Mobil funded the Tech Central Science Foundation
to the tune of NZ$151,430 and two of the members of the coalition -
Vincent Gray and Bob Carter have been contributing writers to that
foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone cast doubt on the largest body of scientific
effort ever assembled on planet - the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) a collaboration of over 1,500 climate experts
from around the world that 17 national academies of science have
endorsed as the pre-emininent authority on climate science on the
planet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone argue against 11 national science academies who
issued a joint statement to the G8 Summit that acknowledged G8
nations have been responsible for much of the past greenhouse gas
emissions? Or recent participants at Wellington's Climate Change
and Governance conference who all agree climate change is real and
happening. Or the International Climate Change Taskforce has said
we have only ten years to act to avoid very dangerous levels of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The scientific community is united, the debate is over," says
Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; 1. The Frank Luntz memo was repeated by the Republican press office to all members of the House and Senate in early 2003. See &lt;a href="http://www.luntzspeak.com/memo.html"&gt;http://www.luntzspeak.com/memo.html.&lt;/a&gt;

Likewise "uncertainty" became "significant remaining uncertainty." One line that says energy production contributes to warming was just crossed out. Cooney has since resigned and gone to work for ExxonMobil, he is not a scientist but a lawyer and a former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute. 2. www.exxonsecrets.org&lt;/p&gt;

	The Climate Defence Network (CDN) today challenged the New Zealand government to catch up with the rest of the world and get serious about tackling climate change, following the latest international developments on climate policy revealed at the Climate Change and Governance Conference in Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said the UK has recognized
the importance of - and has put a price on - carbon pollution. The
UK has done this through a climate change levy and involvement in
the EU emission trading scheme. These policies are among the
drivers which will allow the UK to meet and better its Kyoto
target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that if NZ is going to tackle climate change and
meet its Kyoto target we also need to get a price on carbon and
greenhouse pollution in our economy, through either a carbon charge
or an emissions trading scheme," said Greenpeace climate campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson, on behalf of CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirsty Hamilton, Climate and business consultant from the UK,
told the conference that business needs signals that are "loud,
long and legal," like a carbon tax or emissions trading, so that
they can make the investment decisions that will deliver the
necessary emission reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that the Carbon Disclosure Project - a group of 211
institutional investors representing over US $31 trillion worth of
funds, are investigating how well companies understand and are
prepared for climate change. This year they will be examining the
top 50 NZ companies including energy companies Contact and
Trustpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Fiedler from the Natural Resources Defence Council in
Washington informed the conference of the strong domestic action in
the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many US states have adopted mandatory policies and emission
reduction targets, despite inaction at the federal level. This
places many American states ahead of NZ in terms of addressing
climate change," said Melanie Hutton from WWF on behalf of CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action in both Kyoto and non-Kyoto countries, as revealed at the
conference, indicates that NZ has been left behind in its climate
policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This sends a powerful message to New Zealand to get our climate
policy in order rapidly and to implement strong measures, including
putting a price on greenhouse pollution," concluded Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; CDN is a network of organisations and individuals concerned about the need to prevent destabilising climate change. It includes: ECO, the Environmental Defence Society, Forest &amp;amp; Bird, Federated Mountain Clubs, Friends of the Earth NZ, Greenpeace NZ, WWF, Pacific Institute of Resource Management, Cycling Advocates’ Network, Public Health Association, Ecoaction, Alternative Technology and Lifestyle Association, Nelson Environment Centre, Engineers for Social Responsibility, MedEco, and the Sustainable Energy Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Climate Defence Network (CDN) today welcomed the Climate Change and Governance Conference, as a much needed input into New Zealand's response to climate change. The conference is organised by the Institute of Policy Studies and the School of Earth Sciences of Victoria University of Wellington.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Climate Defence Network is very pleased to see this
conference opening today and the timing couldn't be better. With an
ongoing review of climate policy in New Zealand we hope the
conference will lead to agreement on what we need to do on the
ground to get our emissions down and the conviction to actually do
it," said WWF climate change programme leader Melanie Hutton on
behalf of CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change is the greatest threat facing the world and with
scientists warning we have only 10 years to act to avoid climate
catastrophe, New Zealand needs to join the global movement to cut
emissions. It's time the Government stopped wringing its hands and
dropping its policies and instead took some action," continued
Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson on behalf of
CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need to put a price on carbon and greenhouse gas
emissions if we are going to reduce greenhouse pollution to levels
scientists warn we need. The International Energy Agency last year
criticised Australia for not having a price on carbon so if New
Zealand fails to act we risk similar international criticism and
being left behind in the low carbon economy. We hope that this
conference will be an important step towards this goal," said Ms
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The conference is an excellent opportunity for key officials
and members of the public to become more informed about the latest
climate science, and to draw on regional and international
experience in developing the best policies for reducing emissions,
and adaptation strategies for New Zealand's economy and
biodiversity. The Climate Defence Network hopes that this
information translates into action once the conference closes,"
concluded Ms Hutton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; CDN is a network of organisations and individuals concerned about the need to prevent destabilising climate change.

	Today's announcement that areas would be closed to bottom trawling showed that both the fishing industry and Government acknowledge the need to protect deep-sea life from the destruction caused by bottom trawling, but warned that it will not solve the problem.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;'While 30% of our EEZ sounds like an impressive proposed
closure, the areas do not seem to represent all the vulnerable
areas at risk from bottom trawling. We know, for example, that most
of these areas are too deep to bottom trawl.' said Carmen Gravatt
oceans campaigner. 'The devil is in the detail.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She went on to warn that closing only selected areas would not
solve the problem with the high seas under discussion at this
week's meeting in Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace noted that the closure announcement today is only
within New Zealand's EEZ and has little to do with the
international waters where there are no rules at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'There is plenty of evidence of bottom trawling's devastating
impacts. However there is not enough information around to be able
to select particular areas without knowing the impact of leaving
other vulnerable areas open to bottom trawling.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The only effective measure is a temporary ban on bottom
trawling in international waters while the research is carried out
and the RFMO negotiations are underway,' concluded Ms Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace expressed surprise today on finding that Crop and Food Lincoln seem confused about the taxonomic classification of the common onion (Allium cepa L.).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In its application to field trial onions genetically engineered
for resistance to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, Crop and Food
incorrectly refer to Alliaceae as a genus (1). In fact the genus
onion belongs to is Allium and the family is Alliaceae. This is a
glaring error of botanical nomenclature, particularly for a
research institute focussed on plant sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This inaccuracy highlights a general shoddiness in the
application, which reads like a PR exercise by Monsanto," says
Greenpeace campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It has other inaccuracies and assumptions that lead it to
conclude a blue sky of ideal outcomes for GE onions, without
addressing any of the known negative impacts and risks of Roundup
resistant GE crops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has submitted that ERMA should decline the GE onion
application because it poses unnecessary and unquantifiable risks
to New Zealand's economy, environment and public health and has no
benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace challenges the claim that Roundup resistant GE onions
will reduce herbicide use, when Roundup Ready GE crops in the US
and Canada have lead to increased herbicide use and the use of
older more toxic herbicides to combat 'superweeds'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is already a successful and burgeoning organic
onion industry in New Zealand with zero synthetic herbicide use
which is gaining significant premiums on onion exports to the
UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe and Japan are New Zealand's biggest onion markets
and are very resistant to GE produce. "Why should the NZ taxpayer
be supporting the development of an GE food crop that our export
markets don't want and 80 per cent of New Zealander's think
shouldn't be growing here?" (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Instead of GE crops, Crop and Food should be investing more in
development of GE- free biological technologies and techniques for
improving and expanding organic production".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) P 30 of the Crop and Food application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) 80 per cent of respondents say NZ should remain a GM-free
food producer at least until our export markets accept GM food,

	Greenpeace activists boarded the vessel Atermon today as it berthed in Port Tauranga, preventing 30,000 tonnes of coal from being unloaded. The Indonesian coal is to be burnt at Genesis's Huntly Power Station, fuelling global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Activists climbed the ship's side, preventing the coal from
being unloaded, and displayed banners reading 'Reject polluting
power'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipload of dirty old coal is just the tip of the iceberg.
Genesis is negotiating to import one million tonnes of coal every
year, on top of a recent deal struck with Solid Energy for 11
million tonnes of coal over the next eight years," said climate
campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government must step in and cancel current negotiations for
the importation of one million tonnes of coal every year. State
owned enterprises such as Genesis must be brought in line with
government policy and invest in clean renewable energy such as
wind."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is moving into a phase where we will be burning
more coal for electricity generation than at any other time in our
history. In this age of climate change we need to be rapidly
phasing out fossil use not increasing our dependency on coal - the
most greenhouse gas polluting of all fossil fuels."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Over the next eight years, Genesis plans to increase the amount
of coal it burns at Huntly by about 19 million tonnes. This will
release an additional 45.6 million tonnes of climate changing
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the Government is trying to tackle agricultural
greenhouse gas emissions, they are also hypocritically consenting
to Genesis increasing climate pollution. Many fine words have been
said about renewable energy as the future for New Zealand, yet
Government actions continue to embed more dirty coal into our
electricity system."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Genesis has publicly stated that they will be running Huntly
Power Station on 80% coal and 20% gas. Three years ago it ran on
only 20% coal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Burning coal produces 72% more carbon dioxide than burning
gas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• It takes 1000 trucks to move this shipment of 30,000 tonnes of
coal. This volume of coal can be burnt within 30 hours when Huntly
runs at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Globally we need to break our fossil fuel dependency to avoid
dangerous climate change. As part of this, our Government should
develop an electricity system from 100% renewable sources,
decommission fossil fuel power stations and actively bring on line
clean alternatives," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today the Labour caucus was prevented from leaving Premier House as Greenpeace attempted to dump tonnes of soil at both entrances with tip-trucks.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We are keeping the Government in Premier House until they do
the right thing and say no to GE. Why are they not listening to the
68% of people who want the moratorium extended?" said Greenpeace GE
Campaigner Annette Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our key export countries are demanding GE free products, and NZ
is perfectly placed to provide them. We rely heavily on our clean
green image for trade, and this image will be soiled if the
moratorium is lifted."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour caucus is meeting today to discuss, amongst other things,
the lifting of the GE moratorium at the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This issue cannot be ignored - or swept under the carpet. Our
soil is the basis of our environment and economy. Commonsense says
keep NZ GE free."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Treasury Report released earlier this year (1) looked at
perceptions of NZ and GMOs. They found that 20% to 30% of overseas

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's greatest economic advantage is in being a GE free
producer. Why is the Government compromising this, for no apparent
reason?" said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace accuses NZ of gutting the region's momentum to stop nuclear shipments through the Pacific.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After three years of fruitless dialogue with the shipping states
(France, UK, and Japan), countries decided in February 2003 in Nadi
to pursue legal, diplomatic and other options to end the
shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dialogue fell apart in February this year after the UK made
it clear that they were prepared to make no concessions to the
Pacific nations over the nuclear shipments. The UK continued this
intransigence at a meeting on nuclear shipments at the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna last month.
There was obvious frustration and anger from the Pacific island
states then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, New Zealand has driven a weak compromise that agrees
to go back to the table and continue 'dialogue'. Leaders have
failed to put a timeline on these talks, and have dropped language
urging the pursuit of legal options to end the shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has led a sell out, which has resulted in a failure
by the region's leaders to represent and protect their citizens
from these dangerous and unnecessary shipments," said Shirley
Atatagi-Coutts, Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The threat of legal options demonstrates that the Pacific is
serious about this issue, and strengthens their negotiating
position with shipping states in the 'dialogue'. It makes no sense
to just throw away your bargaining chips, which is what today's
Communiqué does."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has today announced they support the call by Mothers Against Genetic Engineering (MAdGE) for a march up Queen St on Saturday 11 October demanding an extension to the GE moratorium.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Now is the time, more than ever, for people to stand up and
show their support for GE free New Zealand by marching to demand
that the GE moratorium stay in place," said Greenpeace spokesperson
Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government are risking New Zealand's environment, economy
and food chain in the name of political stubbornness. Helen Clark
must listen to the public of whom 68% (1) are saying the moratorium
should be extended," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is seeking the support of volunteers to help promote
the rally and is strongly urging people to take time from their day
on Saturday 11 to make their voice heard in defence of clean green
New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No wise Government can continue to ignore the will of the
people, particularly if we are prepared to take to the streets in
our thousands - which is what we must do," concluded Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a blatant attempt to weaken the Pacific's resolve to stop nuclear shipments, New Zealand officials at the Pacific Islands Forum have pushed to have legal and political steps to protect the region from nuclear shipments dropped.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Instead they are in favour of resuming "dialogue" with nuclear
shipping states the UK, Japan and France - talks that have gone
nowhere for the past three years. Recommendations by officials to
leaders abandon the commitments already agreed in February in Nadi,
Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, France, Japan and Australia have been shipping nuclear
materials through the region since the early 1990s, attracting
angry opposition from countries en route. It took many years to get
the shipping states to the table to discuss the region's
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dialogue" fell apart in Nadi after the UK made it clear it was
not prepared to make concessions to Pacific nations over nuclear
shipments. The UK maintained this position at a meeting on nuclear
shipments at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in
July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The only reason the UK is prepared to come back to the table
now is that the Pacific states dropped the dialogue - talking was
going nowhere and the UK began to fear that the Pacific route would
be closed off," said Greenpeace New Zealand spokesman Glyn
Walters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite strong opposition from Pacific states such as Fiji,
Vanuatu and at the Small Islands States Leaders meeting today, New
Zealand officials have insisted on dropping an agreement to pursue
diplomatic and legal measures to address the risks posed by the
shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Helen Clark must support the Pacific nations and assure the New
Zealand public that Forum members will be able to investigate legal
and diplomatic options in parallel with 'dialogue', to stop these
dangerous nuclear shipments".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Talk on its own will go nowhere".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's like fiddling while Rome burns - if only 'dialogue'
continues, more nuclear shipments will come through the Pacific,
with no prior notification, no liability regime and completely
inadequate emergency response plans".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed some parts of Pete Hodgson's proposed Resource Management Act (RMA) amendments, but expressed grave concern over the gaping holes in climate protection left by key proposals.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"On one hand the proposed law supports renewable ways for
generating electricity and energy efficiency to reduce climate
change. But on the other hand it says regional councils will not be
able to consider greenhouse gas emissions when looking at resource
consents. That would be fine if there were existing mechanisms to
protect the climate from greenhouse gas pollution - but there's
not," said climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The RMA amendments are one small step for renewable energy, but
one giant leap backwards for climate protection."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The amendments point to a possible future National
Environmental Standard to address climate change pollution - but
there isn't one. The carbon tax on emissions doesn't take effect
until 2007. The amendments optimistically suggest that Negotiated
Greenhouse Agreements would fill the gap, but these special
industry deals could just be 'get out of jail free' cards for big
climate polluters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The RMA amendments create a loophole you could drive a coal
truck through. It raises the question whether this is a cynical
move to allow the approval of more coal, oil and gas polluting
power stations before any national regulation comes into
force."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If there was any doubt about who is set to benefit from these
amendments the explanatory notes provides the answer. It states
they will 'result in cost savings for those industries and
individuals who emit greenhouse gases…. such as oil refineries,
coal- and gas-fired power stations and cement producers'."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The carbon tax is a Labour Party policy. Policies and
leadership can change. The threat of a future carbon tax has so far
proven useless in slowing the massive increase in the burning of
coal for electricity - the most carbon dioxide intensive fossil
fuel - as Genesis is moving ahead with long term coal purchases to
change Huntly power station to run mostly on coal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Amendments to remove greenhouse gas emission considerations at
a regional council level should be delayed until active national
mechanisms are in place", concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three Greenpeace activists successfully climbed on to and hung from the port side of the vessel Atermon as it berthed at 4.00pm today in Port Tauranga, preventing 30,000 tonnes of coal from being unloaded.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In all, eight activists were arrested and charged, and then
released by police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace spokesperson Vanessa Atkinson says she was concerned
by the approach the Tauranga harbour authorities took to a peaceful
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Port authorities acted in a reckless manner by ramming our
boats".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to the comments of the harbourmaster on National Radio
this evening, Greenpeace did not act dangerously, and we did get
activists on to the side of the ship."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Three climbers got up on to the ship and unfurled banners
reading 'Reject Polluting Power'".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis is negotiating to import one million tonnes of coal

clean renewable energy such as wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is moving into a phase where the country will be
burning more coal for electricity generation than at any other time
in its history.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has called the latest attempts by the US Undersecretary of Commerce to undermine New Zealand's nuclear free legislation as desperate bullying. US Under-Secretary Grant Aldonas accused New Zealand of preventing them from fighting terrorism by maintaining our nuclear free legislation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It's nothing short of blackmail to infer that somehow our
legislation prevents the US from taking on terrorism. Having a US
nuclear powered ship or a nuclear armed submarine in our harbours
is more likely to attract terrorism to our shores than deter it,"
said Bunny McDarimd, Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The timing of these comments is suspicious as they conincide
with the beginning of the Pacific Islands Forum meeting here in
Auckland," said McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific region also has a nuclear free treaty which has long
rankled with the US. "The spread of nuclear free zones is much more
likely to prevent nuclear terrorism than parking US warships or
submarines in your harbour," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aldonas called our legislation "an artefact of another age",
part of the Cold War, but what he did not say is that not since
Ronald Reagan's Cold War days has US Defence strategy placed such
emphasis on nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush Administration's ambitious programme to revitalize
their nuclear arsenal means the development of smaller more
'usable' nuclear weapons. These new weapons are explicitly linked
to the pre-emptive first strike policies of the US
Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear power and nuclear weapons have not got safer overnight
and the real fear factor today is that nuclear weapons could fall
into the hands of terrorists. Our world-leading legislation is even
more relevant today than it was in 1986. It's nuclear weapons that
don't belong in today's world - not our legislation".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy is their 'forward defence' said Aldonas and he
emphasized that US ships no longer carry nuclear weapons. But US
submarines do, and it is the submarines that are likely to play a
key role in the new US pre-emptive first strike policies, a major
departure from international agreements. Having them in our
harbours would be tacit support for the US pre-emptive first strike
policies. Mr Aldonas wants us to believe that nuclear powered
vessels are harmless, but it is impossible to decouple the nuclear
propulsion issue from the US nuclear defense strategy given the
only nuclear powered vessels today are military ones.&lt;/p&gt;

	Upon returning to Cape Town after a 73-day campaign to defend whales against the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, Greenpeace today outlined a stategy to target international corporations, who can be linked to plans to kill some eight thousand whales over the next 8 years, warning them that 'whaling is bad for business'.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Press conference on board the Greenpeace's ship
Esperanza, which along with Arctic Sunrise, has dogged, delayed and
disrupted the whaling fleet, expedition leader Shane Rattenbury
said: "We have defended whales from the harpoon in one of the most
inhospitable places on earth, the Southern Ocean, but the campaign
is far from over. To end whaling the campaign must now go from the
high seas to the high street. It must go from the lobby corridors
of the International Whaling Commission to the board rooms of the
companies who trade in whales."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is focussing its corporate campaign on the companies
behind Kyodo Senpaku, which owns and operates the whaling fleet. In
response to a letter from Greenpeace, Nissui - Japan's second
largest sea food company which owns a one third share in - Kyodo
Senpaku, said it has no interest in a resumption of commercial
whaling. Internationally, Nissui has shares in such companies as
seafood giant Sealord, JP Klausen (which supplies Nestle, Unilever,
Heinz, and Espersen (McDonald's) in Europe), UniSea, Gorton's and
others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, a popular Argentine seafood company Pesquera Santa
Elena has cancelled contracts with Nissui because of its links to
whaling. There, a Greenpeace internet campaign resulted in over
21,000 'cyberactivists' contacting the company and downloading
stickers to place on Santa Elena products in supermarkets. Within
hours the president of the company gave Greenpeace Argentina a
signed commitment not to buy any more surimi from Nissui. and vowed
to donate about US$60,000 to anti-whaling campaigns if it ever
violates the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) and the Institute for
Cetacean Research (ICR) which run the so-called 'scientific' whale
hunt are dedicated to overturning the 1982 international moratorium
on commercial whaling. In the meantime, by issuing permits for the
so-called scientific hunt, they are making a mockery of the
international agreement to set aside the Southern Ocean as a Whale
Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the already fragile commercial rationale fails to
stand up to investigation. Japan's stockpile of whale meat has
doubled over the past decade, to 4,800 tons. With annual sales
reaching only 6.5 billion yen, the hunt is heavily subsidised by
Japanese tax payers. An opinion poll conducted by the respected
Asahi newspaper in 2002 showed only 4% of Japanese people regularly
eat whale meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that the flimsy
arguments made by the ICR for the hunt are falling apart. Despite
painting the word "Research" on the side of the Nisshin Maru (the
fleet's factory ship, where after being weighed and measured the
whales are chopped and boxed for market), no one seriously believes
that this is science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Fisheries Agency of Japan, the ICR and the whaling fleet
are out of control. The hunt is bankrupt on all counts:
scientifically, ecologically, morally and financially," said
Rattenbury. "With the market for whale meet in Japan collapsing and
stock piles rising, it is clear that the whaling business is bad.
Over the coming months we will be calling on consumers world-wide
to join us in telling the companies that whaling is bad for
business. Not everyone can join us on the high seas to defend the
whales but they can join us on the high streets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventeen Governments recently joined Greenpeace's call for an
immediate end to the hunt and for the fleet to leave the Whale
Sanctuary. In a letter to the Government of Japan they unmasked the
programme as commercial whaling in disguise by pointing out that
"Japan is now killing more whales in the Antarctic every year than
it killed for scientific research in the 31 years prior to the
introduction of the moratorium on commercial whaling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign to defend the whales in the Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary is the first stage in an ambitious new Greenpeace
campaign 'Defending our Oceans'. Over the next year the Esperanza
will be Greenpeace's main platform in arguing for a network of
marine reserves or parks covering 40% of the world's oceans: places
that will be protected from industrial exploitation and
destruction, from industrial fishing and hunting, and places from
which our oceans can begin the process of repair and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage of the Defending Our Oceans campaign will see the
Esperanza leave Cape Town at the end of the month to confront
pirate fisheries along the West Coast of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

They say a review will be conducted 'following completion of the first 6 years of the research.' Each year some 935 minke whales will be killed along with both endangered fin whales and humpback whales.

2 Over 73 days, 57 crew from over 20 countries have travelled 14,500 nautical miles, spent 28 days in contact with the whaling fleet, including 12 days when no whales where killed. Sadly and despite saving a great many whales by blocking the harpooners shot they witnessed the death of at least 123 minke whales.

	Greenpeace responded to Inghams claims today that chickens fed on GE feed are GE free, as absolutely misleading.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mike Rozen of Inghams claims that "The use of this [GE] feed
does not compromise the absolute GM-free status of livestock or
livestock products."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a ridiculous assertion and may well be a breach of the
Fair Trading Act to claim that an animal product raised on soy
containing 85% GE beans (1) is GE free," said Greenpeace campaigner
Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Rozen also questioned the availability of non-GE soy when in
fact certified non-GE is readily available on the international
market and is widely used in Europe and by New Zealand poultry
company Tegel, in response to public preference for non-GE fed
animal products (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace shut down the Inghams feed mill in Hamilton for four
hours today in protest at Inghams use of GE feed. There was one
arrest and five activists including two women climbers are to be
summonsed to answer charges in relation to the non-violent
protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing genetically engineered crops threatens conventional
production and the environment, and GE foods are insufficiently
tested and unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

	Former British Environment Minister Michael Meacher is visiting New Zealand to speak about the release of genetically modified (GM) crops.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Michael Meacher was Minister for the Environment in the Blair
Labour Government until the recent reshuffle in June. In an
impressive career he has served as a minister and frontbench
opposition spokesman for 27 of the past 29 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Environment Minister in a pro-GM Government, Michael
Meacher has been forthright in expressing his concerns about the
lack of scientific evidence to support the release of GM into the
environment and food chain. Meacher has said previously said that
GM crops are "neither safe, nor necessary, nor desirable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Meacher is fresh from a trip to Canada where he witnessed
first hand the levels of GM contamination in Canadian fields. He is
in New Zealand for three days from Tuesday 5 until Thursday 7
August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday Mr Meacher appeared before the Education and
Science Select Committee regarding the New Organisms and Other
Matters Bill, which is designed to pave the way for GM releases,
met with Pete Hodgson and Marion Hobbes, spoke to Federated Farmers
and gave a public lecture at the Victoria University Law
Faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is shocked at how rudely Chair of the Education and
Science Select Committee, MP Brian Donnelly treated the Right
Honourable Michael Meacher today when he shut down evidence the
former UK Environment Minister was giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a missed opportunity for New Zealand to benefit from Mr
Meacher's wealth of knowledge on genetic engineering (GE) and his
comprehensive understanding of the rejection of GE foods across
Europe," said GE campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information Mr Meacher was trying to present was highly
pertinent to the major flaws of the bill in question (New Organisms
and Other Material Bill) that will allow "conditional release" of
GE crops from October this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's installation in Civic Square coincides with an
international fisheries meeting next week at Te Papa where the
devastating impacts of bottom trawling will be discussed. 250
delegates from at least 15 countries are expected to attend to
hammer out the future of deep-sea life in the international waters
of the South Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A temporary ban on bottom trawling in the areas under
discussion is essential. History has shown us that bottom trawling
companies are ruthless. If we wait for years until the talks are
resolved, habitats and species deserving protection could be gone
forever", said ocean campaigner Carmen Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to Civic Square and learn about the bizarre life of the
deep sea and the biggest threat to it: bottom trawling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People coming to our installation will be able to give the
creatures of the deep a voice. Paper deep-sea creatures will be
available for people to write messages to the delegates at Te Papa
urging them to prioritise protecting the incredible life in the
high seas from bottom trawling".&lt;/p&gt;

	Just before dawn this morning Greenpeace activists shut down a mine pit at the Southland  ‘New Vale’ lignite coalmine. This was the third of a series of actions targeting Fonterra’s climate crimes. Support is now building for a public protest at the Fonterra Corporate HQ.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/image/2009/11/greenpeace-activists-shut-down-2.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activists shut down a pit of a southern lignite coal mine used by Fonterra.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dirty lignite coal is used by Fonterra to help fuel operations at its Edendale dairy factory in Southland. Like the two palm kernel shipments targeted by Greenpeace in &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/news/fonterra-climate-crimes/"&gt; September&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/news/fighting-fonterra-s-climate-cr/"&gt; October&lt;/a&gt;, our activists labeled the lignite mine a Fonterra Climate Crime  - this time with a giant 40 meter banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our activists in Southland took this action today, there was a change of guard at Greenpeace. Our 'activist in chief' Gerd Leipold stepped aside to be replaced by Kumi Naido as International Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he took charge of the world's largest environmental campaigning organisation Kumi Naidoo had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are at the cross roads. The future of our planet is at stake. The effects of climate change are being felt by millions of people across the world. We are at a time when civil society needs to be courageous and bold, peaceful and principled in coming together to ensure that we stop catastrophic climate change - the biggest challenge our planet has ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;object width="430" height="270" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/5_VYX8hTOCI&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our much vaunted clean green image New Zealand has more reason than most to step up to the plate and be bold. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/nov/12/new-zealand-greenwash"&gt; Fred Pearce piece in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;  last week gave us a taste how the world may react if we do not live up to our own rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest UN statistics show our emissions of greenhouse gases are up by 22%, or an embarrassing 39% if we look at emissions from fuel burning alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries with big emissions growth started from a low figure in 1990. Arguably, they were playing catchup but there is no such excuse for New Zealand. Our emissions started high and went higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's emissions are 60% higher than those of Britain, per head of population. Among industrialised nations, ours are exceeded only by Canada, the US, Australia and Luxembourg. Pearce outlines a litany of climate crimes accusing us of greenwash and political spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra's climate crimes endanger New Zealand's clean green reputation and consequently our economy. We've long been proud of the leadership we showed by taking a nuclear free stance - let's now do it on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks out from the international climate talks in Copenhagen, Fonterra remains the biggest block to New Zealand doing the right thing on climate change. Prime Minster John Key must bring the dairy giant under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the third action targeting Fonterra but we're not done yet. Next week on Tuesday the 24th we are calling on Aucklanders to join us for a public protest outside the Fonterra corporate Headquarters at 12:30pm 24th November @ 9 Princes Street Auckland (You can RSVP on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz#/event.php?eid=176566502193&amp;amp;ref=mf" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September Greenpeace &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/news/fonterra-exposed/"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; Fonterra's complicity in Indonesian rainforest destruction through palm kernel importation and took action first in &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/news/fonterra-climate-crimes/"&gt; Tauranga&lt;/a&gt; and then again in &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/news/fighting-fonterra-s-climate-cr/"&gt; New Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111825/greenpeace-activists-block-a-s-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FONTERRA'S CLIMATE CRIMES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Palm based animal feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's forests are being destroyed faster than any other forest on earth. In total, Indonesia has already lost 72 per cent of its large intact ancient forests6. A major driver of this deforestation is the expansion of palm plantations. It is essential to stop deforestation as it contributes around 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. Recent estimates from the World Bank rank Indonesia as the third largest greenhouse gas emitter on the planet after China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111825/draining-peatland.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra is now importing palm kernel animal feed to supplement grass which marks a change in dairying from pastoral to industrial. Palm kernel animal feed imports have increased 2,700 fold since 1999, with over one million tonnes imported into New Zealand in 2008 - this is almost a quarter of the world's palm kernel animal feed supply. Agriculture in New Zealand is responsible for 49 per cent of New Zealand's domestic greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions do not include indirect emissions from rainforest destruction in Indonesia to grow supplementary feed for Fonterra's dairy herds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2008 the palm kernel animal feed which New Zealand imported had a carbon footprint of over 20 million tonnes. This is officially unaccounted for. It is more than the entire dairy sector's emissions from New Zealand. In 2008 Fonterra's joint venture subsidiary RD1 entered into a joint venture with one of the world's biggest rainforest destroyers for palm oil and kernel production, Wilmar International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing rainforests for palm, timber and pulp plantations is having a devastating impact on biodiversity and communities. It is the main cause of the decline of the orangutans and Sumatran tiger, of which less than 400 are estimated to be left in the wild. Indigenous peoples who rely on rainforests for their livelihood are also suffering. Under Parliamentary questioning Finance Minister Bill English (standing in for Prime Minister John Key) stated with regards to the impact of palm kernel animal feed on rainforest destruction, "Of course, it has some impact; the Government does not deny that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intensification and fertiliser use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra is the economic driving force behind dairy intensification which is changing how farmers are working with their pastures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet Fonterra's demand for intensification fertiliser companies are replacing a traditional reliance on legumes (such as clovers) to provide the pasture's main source of nitrogen, with a reliance on fossil fuel manufactured chemical fertilisers such as 'urea'. Farmers are unwittingly creating a fertility time-bomb in their soils. The more fertiliser used, the more the natural sources of soil fertility are destroyed, and the more fertiliser needed each year just to maintain production levels for pasture growth. It's a treadmill which farmers are finding very hard to get off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical nitrogen fertiliser use in New Zealand has increased by over 1,200 per cent since 1989, mainly in the form of urea. Chemical fertiliser use is a large driver of emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide which is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide at causing climate change. Since 1990 nitrous oxide emissions in New Zealand have increased by 27 per cent and now account for 16 per cent of all New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions - that's more than all our road transport emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the chemical fertiliser short cut to achieve short bursts of pasture growth is also allowing farmers to increase and maintain high stocking numbers per hectare which has a direct impact on soil structure through compaction. This produces much greater quantities of greenhouse gas emissions and also damages soil, animal and pasture growth and pollutes waterways and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra is one of the biggest users of coal in the country, burning well over 400,000 tonnes a year at its dairy processing factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111825/greenpeace-activists-shut-down.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most coal is burnt in the process to turn milk into milk powder to be sold on the international commodities market to companies like McDonalds and is added into processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra's use of fossil fuels such as coal at its dairy processing factories gives rise to 1.87 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year20. This is almost double the emissions from domestic air travel in New Zealand each year21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives. Biomass (wood) is being used by other New Zealand industries22, but Fonterra has failed to adopt this renewable energy alternative in favour of climate polluting coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deforestation in New Zealand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) says some 455,000 hectares of forestry land is at risk of being deforested and converted into pastoral use - the majority for dairying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111825/smartfarming01.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="277"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to 910,000 rugby fields and is over 25 per cent of the nation's pine plantation area. Converting forestry land for intensive dairy farming functions as a 'double whammy' on the climate. This is because plantation forests, that absorb carbon dioxide, are destroyed and replaced with intensive dairy farming which is one of the most greenhouse gas producing forms of land use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The risk to New Zealand's clean and green reputation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agriculture generates the bulk of our export earnings and has an international reputation not only for quality products, but also for being clean and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 State of the Environment report reveals that there is already a risk that New Zealand's 'clean and green' brand will lose value if we are not vigilant in dealing with the problems that could threaten the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111825/smartfarming02.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry for the Environment suggests this clean green brand is worth $500 million per year to the dairy industry alone and worth billions of dollars a year to the nation24. Consumers in key overseas markets are becoming more concerned with where their food comes from and the environmental impact of its production. Agriculture in New Zealand must stay ahead of the game, and to do so, it must improve its environmental performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As intensification of New Zealand dairy continues, the carbon footprint advantage that New Zealand dairy produce has historically held over the world is being lost unnecessarily and to the detriment of future generations of New Zealand dairy farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has always prided itself on being ahead of the pack in this regard. But we're losing our edge. Reports indicate that by the early part of this decade, low emission farming in Europe was already almost equal to - and in some cases ahead of - New Zealand in terms of emissions performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More worryingly is that New Zealand's performance is becoming close to that of the UK26, a market highly sensitive to climate issues. UK supermarkets are beginning to implement "carbon lifecycle" labelling on products. Our clean, green branding is already being questioned internationally27. If we don't quickly take steps to reduce emissions, we could lose our advantage in these markets forever.&lt;/p&gt;

	If we told you that there was one single way to cut a fifth of global greenhouse emissions - that simply involved hugging trees - would you believe us? Probably not - but that's exactly what's required. And we've got 50 activists in the Indonesian rainforest together with Inglourious Basterds star Mélanie Laurent - doing just that - and calling on world leaders to do the same.
&lt;div&gt;

            Melanie Laurent gives support to Greenpeace activists and local volunteers during attempt to halt drainage by constructing dams on the peatland canals as part of their "Climate Defender Camp" at Kampar Peninsula, Teluk meranti village, Riau province, Indonesia.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiators meet in Barcelona for the final round of talks before December's critical UN climate summit in Copenhagen - our activists and Ms. Laurent are tackling climate change at the frontline of rainforest destruction by damming the industrial drainage of carbon-rich peatlands in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greyleft"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Forest destruction is one of the main causes of climate change. That is why I came here with Greenpeace - to call on world leaders to end deforestation both here and around the globe. It is key to preventing a climate catastrophe" -- Mélanie Laurent, speaking from the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists completed the construction of a dam across one of the many canals built to drain the rainforest and peat soils in order to make way for plantations on the Kampar Peninsula on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. This destruction emits huge quantities of CO₂ and means that Indonesia is the world's third largest climate polluter after China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spent the last week building the dam together with members of the local forest community. Over the weekend we were assisted by Mélanie Laurent, star of Quentin Tarantino's new film Inglourious Basterds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate change starts here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is the region most exposed to and the least prepared for the impacts of climate change, according to the Asian Development Bank. The ADB warns that the poor - and especially women - are the most vulnerable. Approximately 2.2 billion Asians are subsistence farmers; they are already experiencing falling crop yields caused by floods, droughts, erratic rainfall and other climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting biodiversity and forest-dwelling communities, forests and their soils are huge carbon stores; they contain nearly 300 billion tones of carbon. That is 40 times more carbon than the US currently emits to the atmosphere every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best kind of carbon capture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/forests_for_climate/climate-defenders"&gt; Our 'Climate Defenders' Camp' in the heart of the Indonesian rainforest&lt;/a&gt; is a base for our activists who will continue constructing dams across the Kampar Peninsula, which stores some 2 billion tonnes of carbon. And in coming weeks, as December's UN climate summit approaches, we will be calling on Heads of State to pull the world back from the brink of a climate crisis. We need Obama, Merkel, Sarkozy, Brown and other world leaders to commit to much deeper cuts in emissions from fossil fuels and to provide the critical funds needed to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/eu_show_forests_the_money.html"&gt; &lt;img src="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/Picture%203-thumb.png" alt="" width="430" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;30 billion dollars by 2020 is what's needed from rich countries to protect forests - and cut one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's only 1.50 euro per month for each EU citizen - the price of a baguette a month. Check out &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/10/eu_show_forests_the_money.html"&gt; the Climate Defenders Camp blog&lt;/a&gt; to see what a giant cheque from Sarkozy is doing in a deforested area of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to store carbon - is to leave it in the ground. So we are taking action to stop climate change right here - where it starts. And today we released &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/national-forest-fund-approache"&gt; a National Forest Fund Plan&lt;/a&gt; at the climate meeting in Barcelona. The plan shows how the fund could help rapidly reduce emissions from deforestation. If world leaders fail to take ambitious action now - we will face more floods, droughts and famine together with mass species extinction - in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/"&gt;Join Mélanie and our activists by calling on John Key and other world leaders to agree on a firm pact in Copenhagen this December&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.nz/join/planet-join.asp"&gt;We couldn't set up a camp for our activists in the middle of the rainforest without the support of people like you. Please give what you can today. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today condemned the planned Government $150 million 'dry year' oil-fired power plant to be built at Whirinaki, which is the latest in a growing list of big Government - approved spending and contribution to climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Since May the Government has been panic-planning to avoid
another energy crisis," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson. "Ironically, the Government is feeding climate change by
generating electricity with fossil fuels. They have encouraged
investment in fossil fuel power plants and overseen the locking-in
of polluting power sources for the next 20 years".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Commissioning a $150 million oil distillate plant embeds even
more fossil fuel generation in our electricity supply because once
it's built it will stay in our generation mix for decades to come.
This is at a time when we urgently need to phase out fossil fuel
use and be looking for long term renewable energy solutions to
combat climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Investing in a climate changing oil-fired power station to fix
our electricity problems, is like trying to put out a fire with
gasoline. According to the Government's climate change predictions,
there will be a decrease in rainfall in eastern areas and that this
will be most pronounced in winter when demands on hydro are
highest. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas is the main
cause of climate change, which will lead to more droughts,
affecting hydro lakes and worsening the 'dry year problem'."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This new taxpayer subsidy to climate change comes a month after
the World Meteorological Association put out a special report
pointing to an increase in extreme weather events around the world
this year, consistent with global warming predictions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government has no commitment to move away from burning
fossil fuels in electricity generation and has approached the
electricity security problem back-to-front. They have attacked the
symptom - and are contributing to the problem. Instead of modelling
how our electricity system can come from a diverse and secure mix
of renewable sources it has panic-planned its way out of the
electricity crisis by pandering to the fossil fuel cowboys."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pete Hodgson should review our electricity system and create a
long term strategy to move to a 100% renewable electricity system
with a strong emphasis on wind energy, solar, biomass and
micro-hydro to balance out existing hydro and geothermal
generation," concluded Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Year's Government Donations to Climate Change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* At the height of the energy crisis the Government pressured
SOE's Solid Energy and Genesis to come to an agreement over the
supply of coal for the Huntly Power Station. An 8-year, $800
million contract was pushed through by the Government and signed in
May for 11 million tonnes of coal, with little official scrutiny
and no considerations for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The Government is considering underwriting a $21 million gas
turbine proposed at Genesis' Huntly Power Station that would only
be 41% efficient and emit carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

	Apple and Hewlett Packard get green points this month, as HP is rewarded in the latest edition of our Guide to Greener Electronics and Apple releases details of their greenhouse gas emissions. But the big points go to activist consumers for proving once again that public pressure creates positive change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="/new-zealand/Global/new-zealand/External/image/2008/5/ewasteworkerindia.jpg" title=""&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A boy winces at the acrid smoke rising from the computer motherboards being melted over open fires in a electronics waste (e-waste) recycling yard in Delhi. Such open air burning of electronics parts to recover metals causes large exposure of workers and the environment to toxic pollution.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace International &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up"&gt; Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; ranks the 18 top manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones, TVs and games consoles according to their policies and practice on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is published quarterly. We went to press before &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/environment" target="_blank"&gt;Apple's updated environmental information&lt;/a&gt; was published last week, but the welcome news of their transparency about greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental disclosures will be factored in to the next edition. Apple can justly pat itself on the back for listening to their customers who asked for greener gadgets. And all you Apple users should pat yourselves on the back for asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard had their penalty point lifted by putting a personal computer on the market that is virtually free of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/what-s-in-electronic-devices/bfr-pvc-toxic"&gt; PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, or vinyl plastic) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs)&lt;/a&gt;. Only the power supply unit and cable still contain these hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP back on track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP made a commitment in 2007 to have all PC products toxic-free in 2009, but went soft on that commitment earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we painted a protest on Hewlett-Packard's roof saying that HP stood for "Hazardous Products," and organized a phone-in protest with the voice talents of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/breaking-green-promises" target="_blank"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;. With the new &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090915xa.html" target="_blank"&gt;HP ProBook 5310m notebook&lt;/a&gt;, HP has made the first step in catching up with Apple, which eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, and now puts pressure squarely on HP's competitors to put more products on the market that are cleaner and safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/apple-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Apple&lt;/a&gt; are still ahead on toxics removal, having eliminated these materials from its entire product line almost a year ago, partly as a result of our "Green my Apple" campaign which brought consumer pressure to bear from people who loved their Macs, but really wished they came in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow learners: Dell and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and Lenovo each retain a penalty point for delaying their phase-out commitments indefinitely. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/acer-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Acer&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will still achieve its target for eliminating PVC and BFRs in all products by the end of this year. Meanwhile Toshiba has a timeline to phase out these toxic substances from all its products by the end of March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top of the class: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Philips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/nokia-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Nokia&lt;/a&gt; remains at the top of the ranking, with a score of 7.5 out of 10, followed by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/samsung-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Samsung&lt;/a&gt; with 6.9, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/sonyericsson-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; with 6.5 and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/philips-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Philips&lt;/a&gt; -- which leaps from 7th to 4th place -- with 5.9 points. The other climber is &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/sony-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Sony&lt;/a&gt;, rising from 12th to 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow-footed: LGE, Fujitsu and Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/LG-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; LGE&lt;/a&gt; plummets from 4th to 11th position, weighed down by a penalty point for flip-flopping on its promise to get off the toxic sauce by the end of 2010 - now, only its mobile phones will be free of these PVC and BFRs by then, while phase-out in TVs and monitors has been delayed until 2012. At the bottom of the ranking, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/fujitsu-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, with a score of 2.7, overtakes &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/lenovo-guide-to-greener-electronics-13"&gt; Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from 16th to second-last place with a score of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world needs climate leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition of the guide -- which also ranks companies on climate and energy criteria -- is released just two months before crucial climate change talks take place in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these powerful tech companies to stand by their claims and set examples of strong leadership for other industries to follow. It's encouraging that Philips, Acer and Samsung support the levels of greenhouse emissions cuts required to stem dangerous climate change. However industry giants like Apple, Nokia and Microsoft are failing to show climate leadership by making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;

	The announcement from soya traders in Brazil to extend a moratorium on soya expansion, provides hope for the Amazon rainforest. We're not out of the woods yet, but this decision and the history of campaigning which got us here should be celebrated and built upon to protect all ancient forests for the future.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Activists dump soya at the entrance of Cargill's European Headquarters in 2006. Cargill is one of the leading soya traders that has now signed up to the moratorium on Amazon soya expansion.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've received good news about the ongoing campaign to protect the Amazon rainforest: the landmark two year old "soya moratorium", brought about after we demonstrated that the rainforest was being cleared to make way for soya farming, has been extended for another year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Amazon campaign &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising international demand for soya had led many farmers to drive deforestation to make way for soya cultivation. Back in 2006, we published '&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/eating-up-the-amazon"&gt; Eating up the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;', a report on our investigation into the links between soya in the supply chains of leading international food companies and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. At the same time, we dressed up as chickens and heckled McDonald's, one of the companies using soya from the Amazon for Chicken McNuggets back then. The costumes were sweaty but lucky for us (and the planet), &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/McVictory-200706"&gt; McDonalds quickly reacted&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to join us and lead a call for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to this pressure, the major soya traders operating in Brazil announced a two year moratorium which came into effect in July 2006, stopping for the time being the trade in soya grown on newly deforested land. Although recent figures show an increase in Amazon deforestation rates, after three years of decline, the first field evaluation show that the soya harvested this year in the Brazilian Amazon has not come from newly deforested areas. In other words, the moratorium is doing its job and halting soya related forest destruction, despite the pressure from rising soya prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jd_d95WDfXQ"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Companies doing the right thing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two years have not been long enough to establish permanent solutions to halt deforestation related to soya farming and without an extension much of the hard work done to date would have been lost. Credit for the extension goes primarily to two of our, umm, favourite allies - big business and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), which represents soya traders, has recently been under huge pressure from producers who wanted to weaken the moratorium by allowing soya plantations in areas not permitted under the existing agreement. Despite the pressure, in a press conference held in Brasilia, Abiove has just confirmed that it will back the moratorium for another year. "Abiove's decision shows that it is possible for a leading agri-business company to ensure food production without destroying forests", said Paulo Adario, Greenpeace Amazon campaign coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Environment Minister Carlos Minc told reporters: "The moratorium is a successful initiative by civil society and the soya industry. The Federal Government is entering the process now and is committed to register and license all rural properties in the Amazon biome. Inspired by the success of this initiative, the Brazilian government is negotiating similar approaches with the timber and beef industries."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted to see the new environment minister take an active role in ensuring the continuation of the moratorium. Such high level support helps Abiove and the traders convince farmers to support the initiative. His support also serves as a warning to those who continue to destroy forests that their soya will be rejected by the market," concluded Adario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has Minc come out in support of the extension, he has committed the government to speeding up efforts for the registration and mapping of rural properties in the Amazon. This is essential if we are to ensure compliance by all parties to the laws dictating which land may be used for farming and which is off limits for deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Much more still to be done &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement means we're one step closer to achieving that. Further measures include curbing illegal occupation of public lands, harsh penalties for illegal deforestation, driving development to areas away from the rainforest and increasing support for sustainable methods of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rainforests and climate change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the forest a natural wonder but it is home to millions of indigenous peoples. In addition, recent science has proven that tropical forest destruction is responsible for nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to the energy sector. Stopping deforestation of the Amazon would bring us much closer to keeping global temperature rise at below 2°C, which most scientists believe is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/forests/eu-ban-illegal-timber"&gt;Surely there's a law in Europe against importing illegally logged timber, right? Wrong. The EU will vote such a law on July 23rd though, and we need your help to call for a clear and unequivocal "Yes". &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.nz/join/planet-join.asp"&gt;Support Greenpeace with regular monthly donations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists replaced the World Trade Organisation (WTO) sign at its headquarters in Geneva with a new logo, "World Transgenic Order", denouncing the WTO for promoting the corporate interests of the genetic engineering (GE) industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Greenpeace activists representing consumers
were shoved into straitjackets by Uncle Sam, who dumped genetically
engineered (GE) maize on them. This is exactly what the US would
like to do - dump GE food on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right of consumers to say no to GE food is under threat from
the US, heavily influenced by its GE industry. The US is trying to
use the WTO to challenge the European Union's ban on genetically
modified organisms (GMOs). The EU has also recently adopted the
strictest GMO regulations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US challenge amounts to a scare tactic to "encourage"
countries to open their markets to genetically engineered (GE)
food. Many countries fear that if they reject GMOs, they will be
met with huge trade sanctions (which could be worth hundreds of
millions, or even billions of dollars) in the WTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WTO is an inappropriate and incompetent body to deal with
environmental issues such as GMOs, that can have a major impact on
the environment and public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting that the US chose to file the WTO
complaint right before the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol
on Biosafety ("Biosafety Protocol"). It is widely believed that the
Biosafety Protocol is the ultimate target of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Biosafety Protocol, the majority of countries now
commit to the "precautionary principle", on the basis of which they
can regulate and reject GMOs on the ground that they may pose a
threat to the environment and public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the US complaint against the EU, many countries may be
afraid to implement the Biosafety Protocol rules. As a result, the
Biosafety Protocol could be less powerful at best, and at worst,
irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Heinzer, Greenpeace GE Campaigner in Switzerland said "The
internationally endorsed precautionary principle must not be
over-ruled at the expense of promoting corporate interest and
survival of the GE industry, in serious trouble because of the
spreading market rejection of GE products. It is vital that the
world governments secure their ability to adopt restrictions on
GMOs, including introduction of bans, labelling systems and
measures to eliminate genetic contamination."&lt;/p&gt;

	Stake outs, testimony from informers, hidden cameras and tailing trucks full of stolen goods - it reads like a Hollywood movie, but it was an every day experience for Greenpeace activists in Japan, who have spent four months cracking open a major conspiracy of corruption at the heart of Japan's government-backed, sham scientific whaling operation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace Japan whale campaign coordinator Junichi Sato, with the whale meat that was stolen from Japanese taxpayers, and which he provided as evidence to the government -- only to be arrested and charged for doing so.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we displayed a cardboard box filled with the best cuts of whale meat, smuggled ashore by the crew of the Japanese whaling factory ship, Nisshin Maru, for illegal trade and personal gain, at the Japanese taxpayer's expense. The box, along with videotaped testimony and other evidence, suggest widespread embezzelment of whale meat has been occuring for decades under the noses of the public officials who run the whaling programme, and are allowing it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bureaucrats ignore theft from taxpayers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our activists delivered the evidence, including the whale meat, to the Public Prosecutor's office in Tokyo, calling on it to make a full public enquiry into how deep the corruption runs with the whaling programme. We're also calling for an end to the USD$4.7 million taxpayer subsidies for the programme, and for the license of the company operating the whale hunt, Kyodo Senpaku, to be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;object width="425" height="355" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhlOxfAljAo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;

&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhlOxfAljAo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-month Greenpeace investigation employed undercover tactics to reveal dramatic evidence of an embezzlement ring involving crewmembers on board the Nisshin Maru. Informers who spoke to the activists claim that senior crew and officials from Kyodo Senpaku turned a blind eye to the whale meat theft, allowing it to continue for decades. One informer associated with Kyodo Senpaku told Greenpeace that officials from the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) - the agency that carries out the so-called "scientific research" work on board the Nisshin Maru - are most likely aware of the thefts as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The information we have gathered indicates that the scale of the scandal is so great, it would be impossible for the ship's operating company, Kyodo Senpaku, not to know," said Junichi Sato, Greenpeace Japan whales campaign coordinator. "Kyodo Senpaku is turning their back on large scale corruption and theft of taxpayers' money. What we need to know now, through a full public enquiry, is who else is profiting from the whaling programme? Who else has allowed this fraud to continue?" Sato added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from information given by former and current Kyodo Senpaku employees, the Greenpeace investigators secretly documented the offloading of smuggled whale meat into a special truck, while Kyodo Senpaku officials and crew members stood by, following the Nisshin Maru's return earlier this year, on April 15th. Greenpeace then tracked the consignment from the ship to a depot in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111930/consignment-sheet-detailing-i.jpg" border="0" alt="Consignment Label" vspace="4" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consignment sheet detailing, in Japanese, the contents of a crewmembers' personal box offloaded from the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, containing 23.5 kilograms of stolen whale meat.  The sheet lists the contents of the box as "cardboard."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The house that stolen whale meat built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of four boxes destined for the same private address was then intercepted, to verify the contents and establish the fraud. The consignment notes claimed the box contained "cardboard" - but in reality held 23.5kg of salted 'prime' whale meat, worth up to US$3,000, hidden beneath overalls. One informer told Greeneace that dozens of crew take as many as 20 of these boxes each, and said he overheard one crewmember claim that to have built a house from the proceeds in stolen whale bacon alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To track down the final destination of this meat, activists visited pubs and restaurants in a number of different locations around Japan where they requested "special" meat and filmed the responses using hidden cameras. Traders and restaurant owners confirmed that they were expecting the imminent delivery of whale meat from this year's hunt, despite the fact that the Japanese Fisheries Agency and the Institute of Cetacean Research do not release the whale meat for sale before the end of June, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Japanese government-backed scientific whaling programme, which takes place in the internationally-recognised Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, has been continually mired in controversy, lies and scandal, bringing Japan into international disrepute. This latest scandal begs the question of just who profits from a whaling programme which generates no useful science, and is commercially unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scandals high and low: how high does this one go?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="greyright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the scandal of stolen whalemeat is the most shocking, it's not the only revelation to come from this investigation. Further allegations from our informants that require investigation include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing tonnes of whale meat overboard daily because they did not have processing capacity for the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancerous tumours being found and cut out of whales and the remaining meat processed for public sale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted hunts to ensure maximum catch, not random "sampling" as required by the research permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harsh working conditions because of the increased workload from the increased quotas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Japanese society already bristling from a litany of public scandals involving &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jan/18/greenbusiness.recycling"&gt; recycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071029a7.html"&gt;food labelling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2017410.ece"&gt; pensions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1625862,00.html"&gt; bid-rigging for public works&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST15100620071115"&gt; bribes for defence contracts,&lt;/a&gt; the whaling industry now joins the ranks of the dishonoured, as well as earning the scepticism of an increasingly dubious business community, with business magazine Shukan Toyo Keizai suggesting that "&lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2008/02/shukan_toyo_keizai_on_whaling.html"&gt; the stance of whaling hardliners could also be a vent for narrow-minded nationalism&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the whalers &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt; were struggling to pay back $1 billion Yen&lt;/a&gt; in borrowed public funds. With a massive 4,000 tonne stockpile of unconsumed whalemeat and Asahi Shimbun reports of &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt; consumer disinterest in "bloody drippings"&lt;/a&gt;, the whalers seem to be onto a sure loser. To make matters worse, the annual increase in targeted Southern Ocean whales means that supply is already outstripping demand, a situation "unthinkable for an ordinary business entity" according to the accountant of a major audit corporation quoted by the &lt;a href="http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%20%3Chttp://forum.greenpeace.org/int/showpost.php?p=57830&amp;amp;postcount=7%3E"&gt; Asahi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The whaling programme in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is funded by the Japanese taxpayers and they have a right to know who is profiting from their money," commented Sato. "The Japanese whaling programme has already been shamed internationally for its lack of scientific credibility, embarrassed by the generation of vast stockpile of whale meat few want to eat and is now embroiled in a scandal at home for being corrupt. It is time for the whaling programme to be stopped and public money spent on something more honourable." Sato concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/news/whale-meat-scandal-150408/japan-investigate-the-stolen"&gt;Help us create an outcry for a full investigation and demand the permits of the whalers be revoked. Write a letter to the Japanese Prime minister. It will only take a minute. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.nz/join/planet-join.asp"&gt;How can Greenpeace continue to bite the hands of governments and corporations? We don't let them feed us, that's how. But that means we rely on small donations from people like you to keep our investigators undercover, our ships at sea, and our campaigns effective. Please give whatever you can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As bluefin tuna fishing began in the Mediterranean today, just south of Malta - we set out to peacefully rescue endangered fish trapped inside a massive purse seine net. But our boats and activists were met with violence as several fishing vessels closed in on them.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box small-box left"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A Greenpeace inflatable sinks as activists are attacked by industrial fishermen.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having found a fishing vessel - the Jean Marie Christian 6 - towing &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/when-purse-seining-goes-bad/blog/11803"&gt; a purse-seine net&lt;/a&gt;, we launched inflatable boats from our ships the Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise with the intention of submerging one side of the net to free the tuna trapped within. Other tuna vessels in the area immediately confronted and attacked our activists. One activist was seriously injured when the spike of a grappling hook was stabbed straight through his leg. He is now being evacuated for emergency care. Flares were also fired directly at our activists. Two of our inflatable boats were slashed with knives and one sank after being rammed and then run over by fishing vessels. Another inflatable was badly damaged and several of our activists had to be rescued from the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="outline-style: none; color: #467f0d; text-decoration: underline; background-image: url('http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/graphics/2007/4/act-arrow.png'); background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; padding-left: 14px; font-size: 11px; font: normal normal normal 12px/18px Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/Save-the-bluefin-tuna-of-the-Mediterranean-/"&gt; ACT NOW: Join the call for a marine reserve in the Mediterranean for the bluefin tuna!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs ignored&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaction of the industrialised North and international regulatory bodies is essentially condeming this key species to extinction. Many, including Greenpeace and leading scientists, have warned for years that without urgent action - the bluefin will disappear. The Med region's bluefin fishery must be closed immediately to allow bluefin tuna time to recover from decades of overfishing. This decline has been predominately caused by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/when-purse-seining-goes-bad/blog/11803"&gt; the purse seining method of fishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the latest meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to declare a ban on sales of this type of tuna has made the situation even worse. The European governments along with Japan know well that there is abundant and unquestionable evidence of overfishing - yet they once again put shorterm profits before logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are trying to shut down this fishing operation to protect our oceans and the future of the bluefin tuna. We are taking action where politicians and fisheries managers refuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we will continue to take non-violent action at sea throughout the rest of the Mediterranean tuna fishing season which ends on June 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding that the bluefin quota for the Mediterranean Sea be set to zero and that fishing operations targeting the species end immediately. Additionally, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/bluefins-mediterranean-holiday-romance-will-i/blog/11815"&gt; the bluefin spawning grounds, like the Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt;, must be set aside as part of a larger network of protected marine reserves to put the bluefin on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where have all the tuna gone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the assessments of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the current Atlantic bluefin tuna population is less than 15 percent of what it was before the beginning of industrial fishing activities (purse seining). If current fishing rates continue, the bluefin could disappear as a commercial species in just a few years. Globally, over 90 percent of large fish, such as tuna, have disappeared from our oceans, and some scientists warn that all commercial fisheries could collapse in the coming decades. We are demanding that oceans management - including the Mediterranean - be reformed to include a fully-protected network of marine reserves covering 40 percent of the world's oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marine reserves or empty nets forever?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are acting peacefully to ensure healthy oceans and ample fish stocks for future generations. And we intend to peacefully confront Mediterranean bluefin fishing vessels in order to get the bluefin off the pathway to extinction and instead put our oceans on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning for a global network of marine reserves - areas of ocean off-limits to fishing, mining, drilling and other extractive activities - to cover 40 percent of the world's oceans, including the Mediterranean. This is a necessary step to restoring our oceans and fish stocks back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our efforts to stop overfishing and destructive practices have expanded over the last few years from a focus purely on the fishing industry to now include seafood retailers. Retailers buy and sell huge quantities of seafood each year, and form important relationships with both their suppliers and their customers.

            Greenpeace activists blockade trawler
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year we published the &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood-markets-guide/red-list/"&gt;Red Fish
List&lt;/a&gt; showing consumers 12 seafood species to avoid in their
shopping. In May this year we released the report &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood-markets-guide/while-stocks-last/"&gt;While
Stocks Last&lt;/a&gt; - Supermarkets and the Future of Seafood outlining
the problems facing our fisheries and recommending a range of
solutions. We've been &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood-markets-guide/changing-your-business/"&gt;
talking directly to the supermarkets&lt;/a&gt; urging them to adopt
sustainable seafood policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets have enormous purchasing power and are able to
influence the way the fishing industry operates. At present New
Zealand supermarkets are in a position where they stock whatever
seafood is supplied rather than what they want to sell. It's a bit
like a fashion shop trying to sell you a winter wardrobe in the
middle of summer because that's all their suppliers will give
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seafood retailers need a seafood purchasing policy and it needs
to be based on sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is happening across Europe and North America and, as a
result, some supermarkets there no longer stock New Zealand caught
orange roughy or hoki as it is caught by bottom trawling which
fails their &lt;a href="/new-zealand/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood-markets-guide/what-does-sustainable-mean/"&gt;
sustainability&lt;/a&gt; standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has developed a &lt;a href="~/link/0149edb7e83c4b678b03f8faa65bb28a.aspx?epslanguage=en-NZ"&gt;
model sustainable seafood policy&lt;/a&gt; and over the last 12 months
has been &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/action/seafood" target="_blank"&gt;encouraging&lt;/a&gt; New Zealand's two supermarket
companies Progressive Enterprises and Foodstuffs to implement such
a policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foodstuffs (which includes Pak'n'Save, New World, Four Square,
On the Spot, Shoprite and Write Price) has said it is considering
whether to develop a sustainable seafood policy. Progressive
Enterprises (Foodtown, Woolworths, Countdown, Super Value, Fresh
Choice and Woolworths Quickstop and Micro) has told us that
sustainability decisions for the company are made in Australia, not
here in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't think that's good enough - responsibility for the
health of our oceans must be taken here in New Zealand, not left to
someone else to take care of. The Australian government has already
declared orange roughy a threatened species, yet Progressive
Enterprises supermarkets here are still stocking it. Something
needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make ourselves heard we have sent Progressive Enterprises two
loud messages. Last Friday, August 7, we &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org.nz/live-action/foodtown-costing-us-our-oceans/" target="_blank"&gt;blockaded a trawler&lt;/a&gt; which supplies orange
roughy to Foodtown. Orange roughy is caught by seabed trawling -
destroying everything in its path and catching a range of other
marine species which are thrown back dead or dying. It is one of
the most destructive fishing methods in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took this action to establish the clear link that Progressive
Enterprises, through its Foodtown supermarkets, was sponsoring
ocean destruction by not having a sustainable seafood policy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure supermarkets understood the connection we &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org.nz/oceans/second-message-to-foodtown/" target="_blank"&gt;took the same message&lt;/a&gt; to the Quay St Foodtown
in Auckland this week. We dropped a large banner above the front
entrance and called on the manager to adopt a sustainable seafood
policy and to remove orange roughy and unsustainably caught species
from sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These activities were part of a continuing campaign to let New
Zealanders know about the damage that is being done to our oceans
and fisheries, and to encourage our supermarkets to take
responsibility to protect our waters from overfishing and
destructive fishing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

	By now it ought to be obvious to anyone - if we want bluefin tuna tomorrow we need to stop catching them today. But despite the clear scientific evidence and predictions of the bluefin's demise - our activists faced a 2 hour confrontation at sea today when they took action to ensure fish for the future. 
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            An aerial view of French fishermen ramming a Greenpeace inflatable during a peaceful direct action to stop bluefin tuna fishing in the Mediterranean last week. Activists from the Greenpeace ships Rainbow Warrior and the Arctic Sunrise launched high speed inflatable boats in an attempt to submerge one side of a purse seine fishing net to free the trapped tuna. As the action started on the French vessel, Jean Marie Christian 6, the other tuna vessels rushed in to stop the peaceful activists, injuring one Greenpeace activist and sinking one Greenpeace inflatable boat.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched the non-violent direct action from our two ships, the Arctic Sunrise and the Rainbow Warrior, to free bluefin tuna from a large cage bound for a Mediterranean tuna farm. A dramatic two-hour scene ensued with fishermen firing flares and threatening activists with knives. Meanwhile the Maltese Navy joined the fray firing water cannons from a ship and surveying with a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/photos/oceans/2010/tuna-med-sunrise-warrior.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="280"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Sunrise and the Rainbow Warrior were involved in the non-violent direct action today but your help is needed to protect the tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From 7 inflatable boats activists attempted to release tuna from the cage as the Arctic Sunrise went on top of the net to lower it. But with the bluefin tuna fishermen intent on protecting their short-term profits and the Maltese navy more keen to defend private interests than the future of this fishery - it became impossible for us to release the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/12534019"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a0"&gt;Time out for tuna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taking action in the Mediterranean because governments are failing to do so. Releasing bluefin tuna is the only responsible thing to do, for the future of the fish and the future of our oceans. We will confront any and all parts of the Mediterranean bluefin fishery, the most visible example of how politics and fisheries management are failing our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 80 percent of bluefin stocks are estimated to have been fished out of the Mediterranean since industrial fishing in this area began. Ranching operations, like the one Greenpeace confronted today, fatten tuna in order to maximize profits, and continue to increase demand for endangered bluefin tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission did order some large-scale bluefin fishing vessels back to port early (because they had aggressively fished their quota in just a few days), but that's hardly enough when the science tells us NO fishing should take place on such an endangered stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a1"&gt;Ban on bluefin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs to see a ban on bluefin tuna fishing until stocks recover. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the fisheries management body responsible for pushing bluefin to the brink of extinction, must also prove itself capable of being more than an "international disgrace." That particular compliment came from an independent review ICCAT itself commissioned in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been sounding the alarm on the state of Mediterranean tuna stocks for years. We will continue to take non-violent, direct action until governments live up to their responsibility to safeguard the future of these fish and the livelihoods that depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bluefin tuna spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico are accidentally devastated by the oil spill - the bluefin in the Mediterranean are being intentionally obliterated by industrial fishing. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/roadmap-to-recovery/Save-the-bluefin-tuna-of-the-Mediterranean"&gt; Take action to protect the bluefin here by calling for the creation of a marine reserve in a key region of the Med.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donate to support our activists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.nz/join/for-the-oceans.asp?feature"&gt; We depend on individual supporters like you to give us the consistent support we need to protect the planet from environmental degradation, 12 months a year. A monthly donation allows us to plan ahead and respond to environmental emergencies. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In an inspiring move the 55th meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Berlin Monday passed a resolution that makes conservation central to the work of the IWC and will help protect the world's whales, dolphins and porpoises.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This resolution to establish a conservation committee was hard
won at 25 for and 20 against and is a significant shift for the IWC
away from whaling. It will help to prioritise the conservation
needs of cetaceans that are facing a wide range of threats
including entanglement in fishing nets, toxic and noise pollution
and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The oceans are in crisis and the new conservation committee has
a Herculean task ahead of it to address the problems facing
cetaceans but this is a good first step," says Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner Rebecca Hayden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the Mexican Commissioner Andreas Rosental said a vote
against this resolution would have been a vote against
conservation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As expected, whaling nations tried every tactic to prevent the
proposal from succeeding, but it is heartening to see that the will
of the majority of the member countries of IWC support conservation
and alternate uses of whales like high quality whale watching,"
Hayden says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example species like the Vaquita in the Gulf of California
number only 600, and 39 are killed every year in gill nets. They
are in dire need of concrete action. This is a clear case where a
species would benefit from the IWC scientist's attention.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and the Body Shop have joined forces to launch a Switch postcard campaign calling on Helen Clark to lead the country to switch to 100% clean renewable energy supply by 2020, and away from polluting power such as coal. The postcard campaign launch took place at New Zealand's first owned, designed and manufactured wind turbine by Windflow, on Banks Peninsula.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"On the six month anniversary of the Government signing the
Kyoto Protocol, the Body Shop and Greenpeace are saying to the
Government: protect the climate and secure a sustainable energy
supply," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has one of the best energy resources in the world -
wind energy. The Government must change the way they think about
energy and start putting the brakes on global warming by planning
for the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and actively
support wind energy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change is an issue of national importance and Helen
Clark needs to take big steps quickly to bring more wind projects
into the energy mix and establish an energy strategy that will lead
New Zealand to a clean, 100% renewable energy future by 2020.
Unfortunately, recent short-term Government decisions will lead us
towards more dirty old coal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional energy sources such as burning fossil fuels like
coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
that contribute to climate change. Global warming causes glaciers
to melt, sea levels to rise and extreme weather events such as
droughts and floods. Coal produces more global warming carbon
dioxide than any other fossil fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Environmentally damaging energy sources such as coal are
dinosaur relics from the fossil fuel past - and that's where they
should remain. The future of energy is in clean renewable
wind."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We should not be asking 'Why wind farms?' but 'Why not wind
farms?'" said New Zealand Director of The Body Shop, Ashleigh
Ogilvie-Lee. "Being a Wellingtonian myself on those occasional
windy days as I hang onto a lamppost on Lambton Quay, I'd like to
think 'Bad hair day - but great day for the national grid!' The
Body Shop is pleased to join Greenpeace and launch the Switch
postcard campaign to urge Helen Clark to lead the country to 100%
renewable energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;120,000 postcards will be available at Body Shop outlets
throughout the country, cafes, Greenpeace frontliners on the street
and distributed to Greenpeace supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has enough potential wind energy to produce three
times our present power generation each year. Banks Peninsula is
one of thirteen areas around New Zealand identified as having
excellent wind resources that just need to be harnessed," concluded
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Greenpeace today released results that show an Ingham frozen chicken product on sale in New Zealand is contaminated with genetically engineered (GE) soy ingredients (1). Earlier in the year, tests also revealed the Aussie-owned brand uses GE soy in its feed (2).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Inghams are showing a total disregard for their customers
preference - which is for GE-free food," said Greenpeace campaigner
Steve Abel. "Inghams continue to import GE soy meal into New
Zealand for use in animal feed - and this latest test shows that
Inghams are using GE soy contaminated ingredients in their products
too."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also criticised lax labelling regulations which mean
GE feed and many processed ingredients don't require GE labelling
and enter the food chain by stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environmental organisation is encouraging the public to
phone Inghams on 0508 800 785 and express their opposition to GE
food. Greenpeace volunteers will be distributing postcards
addressed to Inghams and demanding that they remove GE feed and
ingredients from the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Supermarkets and other users of Inghams products and feed
should also demand that the company commit to a GE free policy,"
said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's biggest poultry producer Tegel and their feed
subsidiary NRM, shifted to a non-GE feed policy in 2001 following a
public campaign by Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tegel have set the standard for excluding GE ingredients in
animal feed. It's time for Inghams to clean up their act and stop
contaminating New Zealand's food chain with unwanted GE," said
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing of genetically engineered crops threatens
conventional production and the environment and GE foods are
insufficiently tested and labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today sent a pack of its nuclear playing cards to the Minster of Trade Negotiations and leaders of the opposition parties to remind them of the dangers posed by nuclear arsenals, and to demand that they stop playing poker with New Zealand's nuclear free future.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Minister of Trade Negotiations Jim Sutton recently made
'personal' comments about possibly rethinking the nuclear power
aspect of our nuclear free legislation. The legislation has been
called an obstacle to progress on a free trade deal with the US by
opposition politicians and US trade representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nuclear power and nuclear weapons have not suddenly become safe
overnight because some politicians would like a free trade deal
with the US," said Bunny McDiarmid of Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To gamble with New Zealand's nuclear-free future on the slim
hope of a free trade deal is dangerously short-sighted and
demonstrates ignorance of what the legislation means."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace deck of cards shows President Bush and seven
other leaders with the number of nuclear weapons their countries
possess. The ace of spades shows Bush has around 10,600 weapons
while Russian President Vladimir Putin is the ace of hearts with
around 18,000 nuclear weapons. French President Jacques Chirac is
the ace of clubs, and Britain's Tony Blair is the ace of diamonds.
The kings feature the leaders of China, Pakistan, India and Israel
- all countries with nuclear weapons. The two of diamonds notes
that 128,000 nuclear weapons have been built worldwide since
1945.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The cards are a powerful reminder of the increasing number of
nuclear weapons and who the real proliferators are. Much of that
proliferation has been able to happen as a result of the trade of
peaceful nuclear power technology," said McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While no commentator has suggested that New Zealand get rid of
its ban on nuclear weapons, recent comments show an ignorance of
the link between nuclear power and nuclear weapons and of the
important role that New Zealand is able to play internationally in
the disarmament debate because of its unequivocal nuclear-free
status."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace criticised SOE Solid Energy for advocating so-called clean coal power stations and misleading the public about the dirty nature of it's mining operations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Coal remains a health and environmental villain from mine to
sky. Solid Energy's PR spin doesn't change that fact," said
Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson. "Solid Energy's CEO
Don Elder recent claims that coal is "clean" and that the company's
coal is "virtually sustainable" are fundamentally wrong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas is a major
contributor to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday former Solid Energy geologist Paul Caffyn stated that
the company had caused the worst environmental damage in the 160-
year history of the Strongman mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to The Press, Mr Caffyn said explosions at the
Strongman Mine near Greymouth had caused landslips down Doherty and
Waterfall Creeks that had together dumped more than 60,000 cubic
metres of mining debris into Ten Mile Creek. In addition, an
uncontrolled coal-seam fire was so strong the glare was seen well
offshore by fishing boats who used it as a night-time navigation
aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A West Coast Regional Council study has shown that up to 500 km
of West Coast creeks and rivers are contaminated from historic and
present coal mines. The pollution is caused when coal and coal dust
is exposed to air and water, creating sulphuric acid which leaches
into waterways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Solid Energy has tried to scrub off the grime and give coal a
media makeover in recent months. CEO Don Elder has been hustling
his coal power plant ideas to MPs, the media and the public. Both
the burning of coal for energy and it's extraction take a huge toll
on the environment and it's time that the SOE was called to
account".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since 1984 the US government subsidised their coal industry by
$US1.8 billion dollars to try and make 'coal clean'. However, it is
economically impossible to remove carbon dioxide - one of the major
greenhouse global warming gases - from coal, so truly
pollution-free coal power stations will never happen."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal also releases sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
toxic mercury contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's future is in clean renewable energy sources such
as wind and solar, not dirty old coal. The Government must lead the
way and develop an energy strategy that will phase out fossil fuels
and secure 100% renewable energy for New Zealand by 2020. They must
not buy into Solid Energy's dirty dreams of a polluting powered
future."&lt;/p&gt;

	Early this morning, over 100 Greenpeace activists from 15 countries occupied four coal-fired power stations across Italy, demanding that the G8 Heads of State meeting in L'Aquila take decisive leadership on climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            25 Greenpeace activists occupy the Marghera coal power plant as part of nationwide actions targeting four coal power plants in Venice, Italy- July 8 2009. Greenpeace demands the G8 leaders starting their meetings in L'Aquila after the urgent action needed to tackle climate change.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal is the worst climate change pollutant of all fossil fuels. Our committed activists are calling on the G8 Heads of State to take personal responsibility for averting catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/G8action"&gt; Check out the live feed from our G8 climate actions now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Italian jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Politicians talk, but leaders act," says Ben Stewart from the UK. He's currently on top of the 160 metre high chimney at the Fusina plant in Marghera, near Venice. He and 14 other climbers scaled the chimney and nearby cranes to hang banners reading, 'G8 - Take Climate Leadership' and 'Energy Revolution = Clean Jobs'. Another 5 activists are occupying the coal conveyor of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111853/italy-g8-a.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben's no stranger to coal-fired power plants. He was one of the six climate activists who were acquitted last year of criminal damage, after painting the chimney of the UK's controversial Kingsnorth power plant. Today, he's taking action again, and he clearly knows why it's important: "There is no more time to waste," says Ben. "The G8 leaders must stop putting the interests of big coal and other climate-polluting industries ahead of the planet and take strong, decisive leadership on climate change. That means deep cuts in emissions by 2020, investing in adaption and mitigation in the developing world and halting tropical deforestation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/audio/climate/ben-interview-italy.mp3"&gt; Listen to an interview with Ben from on top of the chimney!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In northern Italy, 6 climbers have taken action at the old oil-fired power plant in Porto Tolle, scaling a chimney that is the second highest in the country. The Italian government is planning to re-open the plant as a so-called 'clean coal' plant, by applying an experimental technology called carbon capture and storage - despite the fact that, so far, no large-scale coal-fired power plant is yet equipped with this technology, and experts say it will take at least another 10 years before it's operational, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111853/g8-italy-b.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the plant re-opens, it will emit more than 10 million tonnes of CO2; under the Kyoto Protocol, Italy needs to cut 100 million tonnes of CO2, not increase its CO2 pollution. Italy's plans for the Porto Tolle plant might, quite literally, see its commitments to tackling climate change go up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Vado Ligure, near Genoa, 11 more climbers have scaled both chimneys of the Savona plant, hanging a banner saying to 'Time to Lead on Climate'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in Brindisi, in southern Italy, 6 activists have occupied the coal conveyor of the biggest, most CO2-polluting in the country, and 7 climbers - including Greenpeace Australia-Pacific's climate campaigner Julien Vincent - have scaled the chimney. More than 14 million tonnes of CO2 pollution a year comes out of the Brindisi plant's chimney - that's more than the emissions of the world's 40 least-polluting countries put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111853/g8-italy-c.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="287"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By blocking the coal conveyor belts, we can prevent coal from going into the plant, and we can stop the plant from polluting the planet," says Julien. "We're taking direct action to save the world's climate - now we need to see the G8 doing the same."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The whole world in his hands…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's actions in Italy aren't the first time this week that Greenpeace activists have been challenging world leaders to act to save the climate, or drawing attention to the impacts climate change is wreaking on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in Paris, France, Greenpeace activists delivered the 'world' - in the shape of an inflatable globe - to President Lula. Lula was in France to receive the Félix Houphouët-Boigny peace prize at the UNESCO (United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture) headquarters in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace activists unravelled banners reading 'Save the Climate, Save the Amazon', as a third activist mounted the stage during the ceremony to present the inflatable globe to the President. Lula accepted it on the third offer. Greenpeace was asking him to fulfil his commitments to the environment and on the fight against climate change. Amazon deforestation places Brazil as the fourth highest global greenhouse-gas emitter. The Amazon is also essential to the health of our planet. It is vital in regulating rainfall, and most importantly it is a vast carbon sink - it has been estimated that the Amazon forest stores over 10 times the annual emission amounts made by humans, globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/new-zealand/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/111853/lula1.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="231"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge gap between the President's international rhetoric and the reality of the actions that his government is taking to protect the Amazon rainforest. With tropical rainforest destruction accounting for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, Lula really does hold the continued health and safety of the world in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, the Greenpeace ships are documenting the impacts already being felt. The Arctic Sunrise is in the Arctic as the ice-cap melts at a record rate: a stark reminder that the impacts of climate change are already taking place. The Esperanza is in the Pacific, where people on the 1m-high island nation of Tuvalu are now in the process of working out where they will move to when sea levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's activists in Italy have come from across the world - from the UK, the US, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Finland, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Poland, the Philippines, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Spain. That's an impressive roll call, and not without good reason. Climate change is a global problem - and it requires a global solution. G8 leaders need to show true leadership by tackling the climate change crisis head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;G8: Make the world a better place!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA's Executive Director, Phil Radford, who is at the meeting in L'Aquila, has a more direct message for the G8 leaders meeting this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The G8 Heads of State must break the deadlock in the climate negotiations and stop blaming developing countries for their own inadequate climate policies. This in an opportunity for them to take personal responsibility and show that they are real leaders - who act - and not just politicians full of hot air."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has established the urgent criteria that G8 leaders must agree to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping global temperature rise as far below a 2°C increase as possible, compared to pre-industrial levels, to avert catastrophic climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that global emissions peak by 2015 and be as close to zero as possible by 2050&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Committing, as a group, to cut emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2020, on 1990 levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing USD 106 billion (€74 billion) of the USD 140 billion needed annually for developing countries to adapt to and take action on climate change and to finance forest protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately committing to the establishment of a funding mechanism to stop deforestation and associated emissions in all developing countries by 2020, and achieving zero deforestation in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Indonesia by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the rest of the G8 descends to President Obama's stated goal of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, then our children will inherit a world of droughts, famines and the climate catastrophe that scientists are warning us about," says Phil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Action!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/take_action/leaders-go-to-copenhagen-climate-summit?0"&gt;Tell world leaders to go to the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen and ensure that strong and binding targets are set in order for us to avert catastrophic climate change. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	After a 19 hour stand-off the climbing team on the mast of the E.on coal ship have been served an injunction and are now coming down.

            Kingsnorth Action UK
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around midnight three of my colleagues eased themselves off one of the Greenpeace inflatable speedboats and into the cold water of the river Medway in Kent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to imagine what must be going through your mind in that situation - in the dark, in the cold water, with the looming lights of a large ship getting closer. But however difficult to imagine it is, it must have been even more difficult to do, because Cathy, Emma and Hannah knew that they were swimming out into the channel to block a coal freighter carrying twenty thousand tonnes of coal from docking at the Kingsnorth jetty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they made their swim - on one of the shortest nights of the year - more Greenpeace volunteers flagged the ship down with flares and banners, pulled alongside and clambering up the steep metal sides, across the deck, and on up the mast and funnel. They secured themselves in place and waited for the calls from the morning news shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;&lt;img title="Coal ship 1" src="/new-zealand/PageFiles/111856/CL220609001w.jpg" border="0" alt="Coal ship 1" width="430" height="323"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;Looking down from the mast of the ship. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funnel carries the logo of E.ON, the German energy company who operate the power station at Kingsnorth. E.ON would like to build another coal-fired power station on the site, and the place should be a building site by now. But the plans have been opposed by environmental experts and campaigners, met with indecision from  government, and been delayed again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent government assurances that any new coal fired power stations will capture the carbon they release into the atmosphere, the devil in the detail means that a new plant at Kingsnorth would still pump three quarters of its carbon into the atmosphere - six million tonnes of CO2 a year, a phenomenal amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this explain why someone would voluntarily swim into the path of a coal ship? My colleague Emma, one of the swimmers who lives in nearby Whitstable, explained what was going through her mind before the action: "There's no way we can stop &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/climate"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; if power companies are allowed to keep on burning so much coal. I'm terrified by the scale of the problem my children will have to deal with. We have to give the next generation a chance of beating global warming, and that's why I'm putting my body in the way of that ship."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of greenhouse gases, coal is the dirtiest fuel there is. Coal plants lead to carbon emissions which drive climate change - which threatens people and property around the world from increased risk of flooding, drought, water shortage and extreme weather events. We want to see strong government leadership on energy policy in the run up to the Copenhagen climate summit in December. All of this is why we intervene to stop dirty coal power from becoming the future of Britain's energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while this might explain why Greenpeace campaigns on coal, I'm not sure if it can explain how you put yourself in a place where you're floating in front of an oncoming ship because you've realise that a time comes when this is what the reality of coal's role in driving climate change demands of you.&lt;/p&gt;

	Inghams recent claims that their chicken products are GE free are contradicted by a new Greenpeace commissioned AgriQuality test today (1) showing that soy meal from the Aussie poultry and feed company contains 85% Monsanto genetically engineered Roundup Ready beans.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"These latest tests confirm major GE contamination in
Inghams/Harvey Farms soy feed and reveal just how misleading their
GE free claims have been," said Greenpeace campaigner Steve
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General manager Mike Rozen of Inghams Enterprises (of which
Harvey Farms is a subsidiary) was reported last week as claiming
that the company's chicken, coatings and marinades were GE-free,
following an earlier test revealing GE contamination in one of
Inghams frozen chicken products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food Safety Authority was reported as suggesting that the
contamination of the frozen food product may have been accidental
and pointed out that there is a 1% allowable level of accidental GE
contamination in an ingredient before a product has to be labelled
as containing GE ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some of Inghams ingredients may have accidental GE
contamination but 85% GE contamination in the soy feed is no
accident," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Because our labelling laws are so slack, it is legal for
Inghams to have a no GE label on their chicken even while they are
feeding them 85% GE soy," said Abel. "But from an honest trading
point of view claiming your chicken is GE free to the public while
feeding it GE soy is downright deceitful."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ingham import thousands of tonnes of soy every year for animal
feed and supply feed to the dairy and pork industry too - that is
their core business. The relative quantity of coatings and
marinades they use would be miniscule," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace hasn't seen any documentation to back up Inghams' GE
free marinades claim, but if they are sourcing GE free marinades
that's a start. However if Inghams are serious about meeting
consumer preference for GE free food (2) they've got to get rid of
the GE ingredients from their soy meal," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of the Waikato Ag Field Days, when
farmers order feed for the coming season. Inghams subsidiary Harvey
Farms will be selling GE contaminated feed in competition with the
other major feed supplier NRM - who use certified non-GE crops in
their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

	A voluntary moratorium on genetically engineered field trials is a poor start for the Royal Commission, and calls into question the integrity of the process, Greenpeace stated today. Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today gave the long awaited announcement on the terms of reference for the Royal Commission on GE, which failed to place a ban on GE field trials.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"To allow the possibility for some GE field trials to continue,
whilst carrying out a national debate about the safety, ethics and
risks of such trials, is clearly a contradiction. The potential
risks of genetic pollution - which the Royal Commission is being
set up to investigate - may not be prevented by today's
announcement. As the first major environmental issue Minister
Marian Hobbs has made a decision on, it is a disappointment to see
this poor commitment to a precautionary approach" said Tricia
Allen, Campaigns Director for Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The risk of irreversibility posed by allowing genetically
engineered organisms to be grown is recognised clearly by Minister
Marian Hobbs in her press release of today's announcement. The
wisdom of banning commercial GE applications whilst the Commission
meets is welcomed. But combining this with a voluntary moratorium,
which will still allow field trials to go ahead in secret
locations, is a contradiction. This means that we can kiss goodbye
to the certainty of New Zealand being protected from genetic
pollution" said Tricia Allen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Royal Commission now runs the risk of not protecting our
country from genetic pollution whilst a proper debate takes place"
said Tricia Allen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes for the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the term GE field trial is used here, Greenpeace does not
refer to the application of GE technology for medical purposes,
where these experiments are carried out within closed laboratory
controlled conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

	A new initiative to be introduced by 18 countries to this year's June meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Berlin will greatly strengthen the ability of the IWC to protect the world's cetaceans - whales, dolphins and porpoises.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Berlin Initiative would reorient the IWC away from
exploitation of whales and toward conservation. Greenpeace says it
is a timely proposal and takes into account the wide range of
threats now facing cetaceans in our polluted and over-fished
oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) warned that
some cetacean species could become extinct within a decade and
others remain critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin Initiative needs the support of a majority of the
IWC's member countries to be adopted. The government of Japan and
its paid supporters and pro-whaling countries like Norway and
Iceland are likely to vote against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Commercial whaling will always be unsustainable and belongs in
the history books," says Greenpeace oceans campaigner Sarah
Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many countries now realise the health of our oceans and our own
interests are reflected by the conservation of the world's
remaining whales, dolphins and porpoises. These animals play
crucial roles in ocean ecosystems, and if we expect the seas to
continue to feed us, we need to maintain the balance of those
ecosystems. By actively strengthening the conservation agenda in
the IWC its considerable scientific expertise can be harnessed to
help remedy mistakes of the past and safeguard the oceans for the
future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today cetaceans face a complex array of threats posed by toxic
chemicals, global warming, ozone depletion, noise pollution, over-
fishing and ship strikes, many of which could not have been
anticipated when the IWC was formed over half a century ago in
1946. Tens of thousands of cetaceans are annually taken as
fisheries bycatch and some species and populations, like the North
Atlantic right whale, the baiji, the vaquita and Western North
Pacific population of gray whale, may become extinct this century
unless drastic action is taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The alarming predicament facing many whale, dolphin and
porpoise populations reflects the severity of the wider crisis
facing the oceans," Duthie says. "Because cetaceans are at the top
of the ocean food web, they are especially vulnerable to the
ongoing degradation of the oceans and are an indicator of the
health of those ecosystems. By working to conserve these animals
and address the threats facing them, the IWC will be working to
help restore our oceans as a whole. We call on all governments,
pro-whaling and anti-whaling alike, to vote in favour of the Berlin
Initiative at IWC 55"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 55th meeting of the IWC takes place in Berlin, Germany from
16 - 19th June 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today expressed disappointment that the Government missed the opportunity to lead New Zealand to a clean, renewable energy future in its reaction to the electricity crisis and has left the door open for more dirty old coal and its fossil fuel friends.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Government has missed the point," said Vanessa Atkinson,
Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace. "If we used wind power to its
full capacity and complemented this with the existing hydro
generation we'd be right as rain".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the Government led the way in expanding the development of
wind farms New Zealand wouldn't have future dry year reserve
problems. EECA has already assessed thirteen regions in New Zealand
as being excellent for wind- power production," pointed out
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes the Government has left the door wide open
for more polluting coal and oil-based generation through the new
Electricity Commission's power to commission dry year reserve
generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It would be a huge mistake to entrench more fossil fuel plants
as a source of electricity in New Zealand, either as reserve or for
our baseline energy supply. Fossil fuels are not the answer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This decision does nothing to address the fundamental issues of
sustainable energy supply. The Government should have taken this
opportunity to plan the decommissioning of coal, oil and gas-fired
power plants and map out a switch to renewable energy sources".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping the sun's energy. A
major source of greenhouse gases is the burning of fossil fuels
including coal, oil and gas. Coal releases the most carbon dioxide
of all fossil fuels when burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The biggest irony in this decision is that the droughts which
have caused low water levels in the hydro lakes and other extreme
weather events are consistent with climate change predictions.
Today's Government decision has missed this point," said
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wind is free, it doesn't pollute, it doesn't destroy important
conservation areas, it doesn't need to be mined and transported, it
doesn't give off greenhouse gases - and New Zealand has it in
abundance. Wind is the fuel of the future."&lt;/p&gt;

	More than 30 conservation groups have signed on to a joint statement in support of a new initiative that would see the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moving conservation centre stage.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Under the new initiative, which is currently supported by 19 of
the IWC's member countries, the IWC's conservation agenda would be
strengthened to ensure that the commission furthers its work to
protect endangered dolphins and porpoises, as well as whales. To
facilitate this, a dedicated conservation committee would be
established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Oceans campaigner Sarah Duthie says the IWC has
extensive scientific expertise and is well-placed to lead the world
in the conservation of whales, dolphins and porpoises (collectively
known as cetaceans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The exciting new frontier for whales is working out how to
protect them and their habitat - the oceans of the world which now
face a complex array of threats ranging from noise pollution to
climate change and over fishing," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation groups supporting the Berlin initiative include
Environment and Conservation Organisation of New Zealand (ECO),
Greenpeace, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New
Zealand and WWF. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple majority is required for the Berlin Initiative to be
adopted by the Commission, but some countries including Denmark,
South Africa and Switzerland have not yet committed to supporting
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the IWC, every vote counts," says Duthie. "The whaling
countries Japan, Norway and Iceland publicly express concern about
the endangered status of some populations and species but are
expected to vote against the proposal despite the overwhelming
evidence that many populations of cetacean are highly
endangered."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2003, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) warned that
some cetacean species could become extinct within a decade and
others remain critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whales, dolphins and porpoises are integral to our ocean
ecosystems - if we can't even conserve these animals what hope is
there for the oceans as a whole?" says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1,318 whales were hunted for commercial purposes last year,
either overt or disguised as 'scientific' whaling. Norway took 634
minkes and the Fisheries Agency of Japan took 684 Southern
hemisphere minkes, Northern hemisphere minkes, Bryde's whales, sei
whales and sperm whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Joint statement on the Berlin Initiative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The undersigned groups strongly support the Berlin Initiative to
strengthen the conservation agenda of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) which we believe could deliver major conservation
benefits for cetaceans and the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the ongoing degradation of our oceans, cetaceans now
face a complex array of threats including commercial whaling, toxic
pollution, climate change, commercial fisheries bycatch,
overfishing, ship strikes, ocean noise, and industrial development.
These demand that the IWC should follow a clear conservation
mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IWC has already taken many significant conservation
decisions - including agreeing a moratorium on commercial whaling
in 1982 and establishing a whale sanctuary protecting the entire
Southern Ocean in 1994. More are needed. It is time to build on
these past achievements, make the most of the key scientific
expertise in the IWC Scientific Committee, establish a dedicated
conservation committee and work globally to ensure that the world's
remaining cetaceans are given every possible protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call on all IWC members, regardless of their position on
whaling, to support this important initiative for conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling for stronger action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the wake of today´s release of three major Government reports.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We are in the 11th hour and playing for our survival. New
Zealand needs bold, strong leadership, and we need it fast," said
spokeswoman Cindy Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three reports released today, outlining a draft energy
strategy for New Zealand as well as proposals to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions now and beyond 2012, were a good start but did
not go far enough, she said. "We urge the Government to urgently
adopt policies that will reduce greenhouse pollution at the rate at
which scientists say we must do if we are to avoid dangerous levels
of climate change."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy Baxter said there was real public understanding about the
seriousness of climate change and increased understanding and
commitment from political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All politicians will now be held accountable for their level of
commitment," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders need a clear statement from the Government that
New Zealand will no longer build coal-fired power stations, such as
the proposed Marsden B project, and that our Government is
committed to 100 per cent renewable sources of electricity supply,
which is stopped short of saying in today&amp;amp;acute;s
announcements."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomed the Government move to put a price on
climate-changing pollution, but was worried that emissions trading
was too complicated to be implemented quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We need carrots and sticks," she said. "The Government should
reintroduce the carbon tax as an interim measure, along with
incentives to encourage renewable energies, such as the proposed
feed-in tariff." Climate change and associated issues were
Greenpeace&amp;amp;acute;s number one priority around the world, Cindy
Baxter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the major issue of our time.  It's about survival of
the planet and we&amp;amp;acute;re calling on all political leaders to
have the courage to take bold steps to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions fast enough and on a big enough scale to actually solve
the problem. That means cuts of 20 to 30 per cent by 2020 and 80 to
90 per cent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

	A coalition of environmentalists and investors from Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, have combined to challenge BP Amoco's lack of action on climate change at the company’s Annual General Meeting in London at 11am, 13 April (UK time).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The battle to save the Arctic from climate change and oil
exploration is heading to the boardroom. This resolution is
intended to send a strong signal to the BP Board that they must
make a fundamental shift in their investment strategy if they are
to successfully manage the transition from fossil fuels to clean
energy," said Greenpeace spokesperson Matthew Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders vote (at 11pm tonight New Zealand time) at BP
Amoco's AGM at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on a resolution,
initiated by Greenpeace with partners Trillium Asset Management
Corporation and the US Public Interest Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution calls on the company to abandon its Northstar
project, the first offshore oil production facility in the Arctic
Ocean, and to end attempts to open the US Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge for oil drilling. It also calls for the funds from
Northstar's cancellation to be redirected to BP Amoco's solar
subsidiary company, BP Solarex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently BP's investment in renewable energy equals about three
days of its annual oil and gas spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influential Pension and Investment Research Consultants
(PIRC) has recommended in a report to its clients, which include
some of the largest funds in the UK, to support the Greenpeace
resolution. The Derbyshire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;County Council Pension Fund and South Yorkshire Pension Fund
have announced they will support the resolution while Birmingham
City Council Fund has said it will show its disapproval of BP by
abstaining from a vote on the motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace set up Ice Camp Sirius on February 12, just 1.5 miles
from the BP Amoco Northstar project on the frozen Arctic Ocean, to
protest against exploring for more climate destroying oil. On April
11 (NZ time) New Zealander Tanya Popp was arrested and charged with
trespass, whilst trying to stop BP Amoco from laying an oil
pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists today have halted distribution of Nestle products at Nestle’s South Auckland distribution centre. The action aims to prevent food potentially contaminated with GE ingredients from being distributed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is closing down Nestle's distribution site today
because we have discovered that its instant soy drink, marketed
under the brand name 'Carnation', is contaminated with Monsanto's
genetically engineered Roundup Ready Soya" says Carl Reller,
Greenpeace GE Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nestle have guaranteed that they will rid their food products
of genetically engineered ingredients in Austria, France, Germany,
Belgium, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong over the past year. But
at the same time they are still supplying GE food to New
Zealanders. This is unacceptable to consumers in New Zealand. GE
food is not wanted, and its not needed. We invite Nestle today to
make a public commitment to go GE free in New Zealand" says Carl
Reller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto's genetically engineered Roundup Ready soybean was
first commercially planted in 1996. It now accounts for 50% of the
US soya crop. Whilst little is known about the environmental and
health implications of the swift introduction of commercially grown
GE crops, the potential risks to biodiversity would be
irreversible. &lt;/p&gt;

	As the Japanese whaling fleet offloaded its cargo of 439 minke whales hunted illegally in the protected Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, Greenpeace called on Japan and Norway to withdraw their proposals to resume an international trade in whales.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Japan and Norway are aggressively lobbying other countries,
including such South Pacific nations as the Solomon Islands, to
support their proposals to overturn the international ban on trade
in whale products at this week's meeting of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), in Nairobi,
Kenya (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan and Norway should immediately withdraw their proposals,
stop wasting the time of the CITES meeting and undermining
international efforts to protect whales," says Sarah Duthie,
Greenpeace New Zealand Ocean Ecology Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan and Norway are trying to use CITES to undermine the
International Whaling Commission's ban on commercial whaling", Says
John Frizell, Greenpeace International whales campaigner.
"Decimation of whale populations during the last century shows that
nothing short of a ban on commercial exploitation, backed by a ban
on international trade, gives whales the protection they need. If
the current trade ban is lifted, whaling will spiral out of control
once again. It will be a disaster for whales."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the CITES Secretariat has recommended that
Japan and Norway's proposals be rejected, both whaling nations are
still pressing CITES to allow the international trade in minke and
gray whales. Japan and Norway currently hunt minke whales in the
southern ocean and north Atlantic and North Pacific, despite the
international ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch unloaded from the whaling ship Nisshin Maru will be
sold on the Japanese market at an estimated wholesale value of
US$35 million and will retail for about US$100 million (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That catch includes whales which Greenpeace activists, New
Zealanders amongst them, tried to prevent being caught during
non-violent direct action in December and January. The
international community, including the New Zealand government,
voiced strong opposition to Japan's continued illegal whaling in
the Southern Ocean Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes for Editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) CITES takes place in Nairobi on 10-20 April 2000. Three
proposals concern the 'downlisting' of the minke whale,
Balaenoptera acutorostrata, from Appendix I to Appendix II of the
CITES list. Two have been submitted by Japan for the Okhotsk
Sea-West Pacific and Southern Hemisphere stocks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and one has been submitted by Norway for the Northeast and North
Atlantic Central stocks. Japan is also proposing the same
downlisting for Eastern Pacific stock of gray whales, Eschrichtius
robustus. Downlisting allows for trade in listed species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Whilst Norway ignores the IWC's ban on commercial whaling,
Japan conducts whaling under the guise of 'scientific research'
despite the fact that the IWC has repeatedly asked Japan to stop
this program and its scientists have concluded that the program is
'not required for management'. By hunting whales, Japan is in
violation of articles 65 and 120 of the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

            Sea mounties outside the Canadian embassy in Wellington New Zealand hold a banner saying "Shame on Canada - Stop deep-sea destruction"
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two protesters dressed as Canadian Mounties &amp;amp;#150; in this
case, Sea Mounties - were joined by other Greenpeace activists
handing out leaflets to Canadian High Commission staff this morning
alongside a banner reading "Shame on Canada - Stop deep-sea
destruction".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace NZ delivered a letter from Greenpeace New Zealand and
Environment and Conservation Organisations of New Zealand (ECO) to
Canada's High Commissioner addressed to Canadian Prime Minister,
Stephen Harper, which urged him to reconsider his country's
opposition to a moratorium on bottom trawling in international
waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada's once-abundant cod and New Zealand's orange roughy have
been all but wiped out in the world's biggest fisheries disasters
of modern times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In both cases, these fish populations have been decimated by
bottom trawlers that also bulldoze their ancient habitats. Bottom
trawling is like destroying paddocks in order to harvest sheep - no
farmer would be that crazy," says Greenpeace political advisor
Geoff Keey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We all need to learn from these disasters and act quickly to
protect the incredible life in the deep sea. That's why it is
particularly upsetting to see the Canadian Government - that should
know better - undermining progress on a UN moratorium on bottom
trawling in international waters".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The science is clear, the first hand accounts and photos all
back up the nasty impacts of bottom trawling. It's time for Canada
to show the kind of leadership our oceans need," said Keey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN meets next month to negotiate over ways to stop the
destruction of deep-sea life in international waters caused by
bottom trawlers - including moratorium on the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial bottom trawling, or 'dragging' as the Canadians call
it, had become the dominant fishing practice after WWII in the
centuries-old cod fishery off eastern Canada. By 1992, the cod
stocks were devastated, the fishery collapsed and more than forty
thousand people were thrown out of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We need to see leadership from Canada, not blind repetition of
past mistakes ," concluded Keey.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is utterly flabbergasted that the Labour Party got advice at the weekend from one of Australia's pariahs of climate policy: the Queensland premier and coal man Peter Beattie.
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace activist Adam Shore hangs from the side of the ship Atermon, in a protest to stop the unloading of coal from Indonesia to be burnt at the Huntly power station.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland is the biggest coal exporting state in the
world&amp;amp;acute;s biggest coal exporting country, with new export
infrastructure and new coalmines on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Queensland is seen as the state which refuses to move on
climate change; which is run by the coal industry, and which is one
of the reasons that John Howard won't sign up to the Kyoto
Protocol," said Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace climate change
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We applaud Helen Clark for saying that she wants to be bold on
climate change, but she's gotten off to a very bad start and is
already going in the wrong direction by listening to one of
Australia's top coal men. This is evident in the line she is taking
on clean coal today," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as "clean coal". The terminology "clean
coal" was coined by the coal industry's PR machine, which realised
that it had to greenwash the fact that coal is the worst of the
fossil fuels causing climate change. This spin will not get us out
of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to deal
with the carbon dioxide coming from coal are unproven and,
according to international scientists, at least 50 years away from
being economically and environmentally viable at a widespread
level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCS would triple the price of coal for electricity, making it
much more expensive than renewable energy. Storage sites would have
to be maintained and monitored for 100,000 years, plus unquantified
liability issues of leaking C02. &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is today launching the Global Whale Sanctuary petition at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in Auckland. The petition calls on the New Zealand government to take a leadership role in ending commercial whaling by sponsoring and pressing for approval of regional whale sanctuaries toward the goal of a global whale sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Sir Peter Blake will be the official signatory to the petition
and will be a speaker at the launch together with Jim McLay, the
New Zealand Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission.
The Right Honourable Helen Clark, Prime Minister will be invited to
conclude. Other speakers will be Michael Taylor, the first
Greenpeace New Zealand whaling campaigner and Sarah Duthie, the
Greenpeace New Zealand ocean ecology campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sanctuaries are a forward thinking measure. They send a clear
message of hope that the world is turning away from whaling and
that there will be no return to the commercial hunting which
devastated one population after another." said Sarah Duthie, Ocean
Ecology Campaigner Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace offices around the world are co-ordinating the Global
Whale Sanctuary petition. The New Zealand petition will be
presented to the New Zealand government prior to the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Adelaide in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The petition will be held at the Bodyshop, various marine mammel
watching ventures, dive stores and tourist operators around the
country. The petition can also be printed from the Greenpeace
website:www.greenpeace.org.nz &lt;/p&gt;

	Eight Greenpeace protesters, including two New Zealanders (1), parachuted and snowmobiled their way onto the frozen Arctic Ocean to monitor and protest the construction of BP Amoco’s Northstar project. Using a DC-3 cargo plane to fly supplies out to the ice, the protesters set up Ice Camp ‘Sirius’ (2) one mile from the controversial oil production facility construction site, in a bid to protect the earth’s climate from the continued production and burning of fossil fuels and protest the Northstar project.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is ground zero for climate change - the Arctic is warming
faster than anywhere else on the planet," said Dan Ritzman,
Greenpeace Climate Campaigner at Ice Camp Sirius. "BP Amoco
promotes itself as a green oil company that is concerned about
climate change, yet continues to drill in new oil frontiers with
projects such as Northstar. It's time for BP Amoco to put its money
where its mouth is and shift its investments away from fossil fuels
and toward climate-friendly forms of energy such as solar power,"
said Ritzman.(3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 1998 draft environmental impact study the US Army Corps of
Engineers estimated the chance of a major oil spill at one in four.
If the Northstar project is built, it will open the door for
several other offshore drilling projects and for leases and
drilling throughout the Beaufort Sea. Opening this new oil frontier
will have grave consequences for the climate as well as the polar
bears, whales, seals and other wildlife that call the Beaufort Sea
home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The science of climate change tells us that we cannot burn more
than one quarter of all known fossil fuel reserves without risking
dangerous climate change" said Sue Connor, Greenpeace New Zealand
climate campaigner. "Northstar is exactly the kind of project that
must stop. The headlong rush of governments, including New Zealand,
to open up new fossil fuel frontiers, totally contradicts
international commitments to preventing dangerous climate change"
said Connor (4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has made a commitment to ratifying the Kyoto
Protocol this year, which requires New Zealand to stabilise its
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2012. The main
greenhouse gas causing human induced climate change is carbon
dioxide, emitted predominantely as a result of burning fossil fuels
such as oil, gas and coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes To Editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The two New Zealanders are Tanya Popp (photo available),
from Coromandel and Henk Haazen from Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) On February 12, eight Greenpeace protesters used snowmobiles
to get to a site near Reindeer Island, approximately seven miles
east of the planned site for Ice Camp Sirius, and 10 miles north of
Prudhoe Bay. Equipped with full survival gear and
telecommunications equipment, they spent 15 days living in tents
while they prepared the runway and waited for the DC-3 cargo
plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 26, the DC-3 arrived with survival and
telecommunications equipment. While the plane circled the airstrip,
a parachutist jumped from the plane. The parachutist was necessary
to help guide the DC-3 on its approach and landing on the airstrip.
Once on the ground, the DC-3's cargo was offloaded in 25 minutes,
and departed after a total of 60 minutes on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp is made up of two buildings fully equipped with
state-of-the-art telecommunications gear, and will have five wind
generators to provide power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) If built, BP Amoco's Northstar project would produce oil
from an artificial island six miles off Alaska's north coast. Oil
would be transported ashore in a pipeline buried beneath the
seabed. Subsea pipelines are untested and unproven in the Arctic
Ocean, an environment of solid or broken ice for more than nine
months of the year, of extreme temperatures, harsh storms and
months of darkness. Due to these and other factors, an oil spill
would be unable to be cleaned up for over 50 per cent of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) New Zealand's Acceptable Frontiers Offer under the Crown's
Minerals Programme is designed to attract offshore companies to
explore New Zealand's fossil fuel frontiers. &lt;/p&gt;

	Late last night (NZ time) two Greenpeace activists in an inflatable boat were dragged half way up the stern ramp of a Japanese whaling ship after they attached their boat to a tow-line being used to transfer a harpooned Minke whale from a catcher ship to the factory ship Nisshin-maru.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The crew on board the Nisshin-maru then used a long handled
flensing knife - normally used for sectioning whales - to cut the
inflatable boat from the tow rope, sending it shooting back down
the stern ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Nisshin-maru moved away at high speed in order to resume
whaling, six activists (including Japanese activist Yasuhiro Ito)
then jumped into sub-zero waters in front of the ship, which did
not slow down or divert from its course. No-one was injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For 24 days now our activists have been doing everything they
can to force Japan to stop illegal whaling, doing the job that
should be done by the governments of the world. Other countries
must use the strongest diplomatic means to tell Japan they will not
abide them continuing to trample international law," John Bowler,
Greenpeace campaigner onboard the MV Arctic Sunrise said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Labour led government must follow the lead of Greenpeace in
showing the strongest possible opposition to Japan's illegal
whaling programme" said Sarah Duthie, Greenpeace Ocean Ecology
Campaigner. "The Labour policy stated a commitment to oppose Japans
scientific whaling, yet we have seen no action, and the whaling
fleet has continued their illegal actions in the Southern Ocean.
Greenpeace is challenging the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, to
immediately contact the Foreign Minister of Japan and make the
strongest diplomatic protests."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two activists inside the inflatable attached to the tow-line
were Deb McIntyre (Australia) and David de Jong (Netherlands). The
six activists that jumped in front of the Nisshin Maru were
Yasuhiro Ito (Japan), Zeger Zel (Netherlands), Frank Kamp
(Netherlands), Deb McIntyre (Australia), Milko Schwartzman
(Argentina) and Juame Espina (Spain).&lt;/p&gt;

	Last night a Greenpeace activist jumped from an inflatable boat into the icy waters of the Antarctic today in a bid to stop the transfer of a harpooned Minke whale from a Japanese catcher ship to the fleets’ factory ship for butchering.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The whale had been illegally hunted inside the internationally
recognised whale sanctuary that surrounds Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch activist Frank Kamp, 36, twice jumped from an inflatable
into the freezing Antarctic waters in an attempt to divert the
whale transfer process, the first time jumping into the path of the
factory ship Nisshin-maru and forcing it to change course; the
second time climbing onto the back of the harpooned whale as it was
dragged up the stern ramp of the factory ship. As catcher ships can
only carry two harpooned whales at a time, disrupting the transfer
is an effective way to prevent further hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the New Zealand Government to renew its
opposition to Japans 'scientific' whaling programme by demanding
that the Japanese government cancel its illegal Antarctic whaling
programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southern Ocean around Antarctica was formally declared a
whale sanctuary in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission
(IWC), making the region off limits to commercial whaling. However
despite repeated requests from the IWC to cancel its whaling
program Japan began hunting in the Sanctuary last month, intending
to kill 440 Minke whales (up from 389 last year) as part of a
so-called "scientific research" program. The whale meat produced by
the 'research' is sold on the open market in Japan, retailing for
$US100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ignoring the IWC's requests to stop whaling in the Southern
Ocean Sanctuary Japan is in breach of the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea, which requires all countries to co-operate
with the IWC in the conservation of whales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exp. contact date:&lt;/b&gt; 0207-01-15 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;

	An international coalition of more than 60 environmental groups has called on New Zealand to pull its bottom trawl fishing fleet out of the international waters of the South Pacific to protect deep-sea life.

            Nelson 30-July-2006: Greenpeace activists block the trawl ramp of Belize flagged Chinese bottom trawler Chang Xing in Port Nelson, New Zealand. Two other activists climbed the mast and along with one other attached to the mooring line stopped the vessel from leaving port. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, the Deep Sea
Conservation Coalition (DSCC) urged her government to withdraw
licences from New Zealand-flagged bottom trawlers that fish in
international waters for orange roughy and other deep-sea species.
An interim ban would remain until effective conservation and
management measures are established that protect vulnerable
deep-sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their letter to Ms Clark, DSCC coordinator, Kelly Rigg, and
policy advisor, Matthew Gianni, said such initiative would
demonstrate strong leadership and New Zealand's commitment to
protect deep-sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand is responsible for 90% of the high seas bottom
trawling in the South Pacific region. If New Zealand removes its
bottom trawlers, it will immediately end the biggest source of
damage to deep-sea life in the region, and it would send a positive
message about New Zealand's commitment that would be noticed
worldwide," said DSCC policy advisor Matthew Gianni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Helen Clark has just announced she wants New Zealand aiming to
be 'the first country which is truly sustainable'. Ending New
Zealand's part in the destruction of deep sea life in international
waters would be a logical next step," said Mr Gianni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 6, fishing nations from around the world will join
New Zealand, Australia and Chile in Hobart to resume negotiations
agreed last February on a new regional fisheries management
organization to cover the South Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day the talks continue, so too does the destruction of
bottom trawling. It's expected to take several years to conclude
the negotiations and then get the new organization running
effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Deep-sea life in the high seas of the South Pacific and Tasman
Sea can't survive any more years of plunder by New Zealand's bottom
trawl fleet," said Mr. Gianni. "There is no need to wait, because
New Zealand has the authority to act now, on its own, to halt the
destruction".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DSCC urged the Prime Minister to ensure that her government
plays a leadership role at Hobart and negotiates a temporary ban on
bottom trawling throughout the entire South Pacific, to remain in
place until effective conservation and management measures and
enforcement capability are finally established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By announcing its intention to withdraw its high seas bottom
trawling fleet, New Zealand would gain enormous respect for its
commitment to biodiversity protection from the international
community," Mr. Gianni said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It would also send a strong signal to nations at the United
Nations General Assembly currently negotiating over how to end
destructive high seas bottom trawling that New Zealand is prepared
to take direct responsibility for protecting deep-sea
biodiversity," he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	A hundred shareholders holding over 120,000 shares forced BP Amoco’s Arctic exploration plans onto the company’s annual general meeting agenda by submitting (on 26 January 2000 – UK time) a formal resolution opposing BP’s controversial ‘Northstar’ project. Investors in BP Amoco will now have the chance to vote on whether the high-risk rig and sub-sea pipeline project in the Arctic Ocean should go ahead. The move will also give BP Amoco’s 800,000 shareholders a chance to prevent the company from lobbying for the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the only part of America’s Arctic completely off-limits to oil exploration.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The resolution submitted by British and American investors also
asks BP Amoco to invest capital freed up from arctic projects in
expanded solar manufacturing capacity. The hundred shareholders
have been gathered together by Greenpeace, the US socially
responsible investor Trillium Management Corporation and US Public
Interest Group - PIRG (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Billenness, senior analyst with Trillium Asset Management
Corporation said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As US investors we support BP Amoco's aim to play a leading
role in supplying the world's energy needs without damaging the
environment. Unfortunately we have yet to see any sign of BP Amoco
actually acting on this green vision. With this resolution,
shareholders in the US and for the first time in Europe have a
chance to put policy into practice. They can choose between funding
dirty arctic oil or clean and profitable solar power."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Amoco is forging ahead with Northstar, which will use risky
and untested technology to transport oil ashore in pipes buried
beneath the seabed. The US Army Corps of Engineers have said that
there is an up to one in four chance of a major spill during
Northstar's lifetime. Oil spills would harm polar bears, endangered
bowhead whales and seals that migrate through the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important polar bear
breeding ground as well as home to indigenous groups such as the
Gwich'in people. BP Amoco currently finances 'Arctic Power', a
group set up solely to lobby US Congress to open up the wildlife
refuge for oil and gas drilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned shareholders submitting the resolution are asking BP
Amoco to switch investment to solar and make its vision of being a
green energy company a reality. BP has a solar subsidiary, Solarex,
yet ironically the company is not making profits from solar because
of its lack of ambition for solar business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar is too expensive to generate large-scale consumer demand
because the level of solar panel production is too low. However a
recent report by financial analysts KPMG, showed that panel prices
would come crashing down if just one large solar factory was built.
This factory would cost slightly less than Northstar. Despite this
market opportunity, 99.95% of BP Amoco's investments are in fossil
fuels - which cause devastating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Amoco's CEO John Browne has made widely publicised statements
supporting action on climate change - while encouraging massive oil
expansion in the Arctic. The Western Arctic is on the frontline of
climate change, warming three to five times faster than the Earth
as a whole, resulting in major problems like a reduction in sea
ice, which is threatening Arctic species such as the polar bear and
walrus who feed on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace campaigner Stephanie Tunmore said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Arctic already undergoing massive changes due to global
climate change. Polar bear populations are already suffering. Yet
BP Amoco is investing US $5 billion on arctic oil expansion. This
is entirely incompatible with their vision of being environmentally
responsible."&lt;/p&gt;

	As the energy crisis deepens, Greenpeace today released its vision for a renewable energy future for New Zealand, and a paper outlining how wind and renewable energy can supply all our electricity needs.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is at a crossroads - a long term energy strategy is
urgently needed for New Zealand which takes us to 100% renewable
energy supply, including wind and solar, said climate campaigner
Vanessa Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government should be making choices that will lead to
generating clean renewable energy. Panic decisions in response to
the energy crisis must not entrench old fossil fuels based
industries, which incur further environmental damage, continued
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas releases carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate
change. The New Zealand Government has signed the Kyoto protocol so
we could help lead the world in greenhouse gas reduction and put
the brakes on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity market at the moment makes it very difficult for
these new more environmentally friendly industries to compete. It
is the Governments role to put in place mechanisms, targets and
incentives to allow a speedy transition to a 100% renewable energy,
said Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few, if any other energy sources in New Zealand can offer such a
secure, efficient and environmentally friendly supply as wind. New
Zealand has one of the best and most under utilised wind resources
in the world and we have enough potential wind energy to produce
three times our present power generation each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has three sites with large wind turbines (Manawatu,
Wairarapa and Wellington). The first entirely New Zealand made and
designed large wind turbine (over 3kW), will be installed by
Windflow tomorrow on Banks Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still some obstacles in the way for wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous Governments assisted many of the original big power
stations we currently rely on with enormous subsidies and
incentives. But for wind its a different story. Today, new wind
power initiatives have large start-up costs that make it hard to
compete against the advantages that other energy projects already
have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government needs to take big steps to quickly bring wind
projects into the energy mix and establish an energy strategy that
will lead New Zealand to a clean, green renewable energy future,
concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	As the New Zealand Government pushes through legislation to further enable commercial release of genetically engineered (GE) crops, Australian state governments are ensuring that Australia will remain free from GE food crops for at least another year (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's announcement of a twelve month freeze by Victoria's
Bracks Government now means all major Australian canola growing
states have imposed some form of moratorium on the commercial
release of the country's first proposed GE food crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently re-elected New South Wales Premier Bob Carr's promised
bill for a three year moratorium on GE food crops is expected to
pass through the state legislature in the next few weeks. Western
Australia is currently drafting legislation for a five-year
moratorium and Tasmania has a ban on all GE food crops in place
until 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Australia Government has asked the biotech industry
not to plant this year with a parliamentary inquiry reporting back
in June. Neither the Northern Territory nor ACT grows canola.
Queensland grows very little and has missed the planting season for
this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Victorian decision comes as a major blow to applicants
Monsanto and Bayer, who have lobbied strongly for the release of
their GE canola products. As one of the world's largest exporters
of canola, Australia is seen as a key area for expansion of GE
crops, which are struggling to find acceptance outside North
America and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Australia Pacific campaigner John Hepburn described
the national freeze on GE canola as "a victory for common sense".
"GE crops are a pariah both domestically and on world markets. It
is not in Australia's economic interest to introduce GE canola, nor
is it in the interests of the community".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Steve Abel said: "Our own
Labour Government should be listening to public opinion and the
clearly demonstrated economic imperative against GE crops by
legislating a ban on them here". "But they have become so
entrenched in the politics of lifting the moratorium that they
intend to give up the very GE free opportunity that the Royal
Commission advised we must maintain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Australia currently only allows the commercial planting of
GE cotton and GE carnations.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand Government should immediately withdraw its support for the US case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the de-facto genetic engineering (GE) moratorium in Europe. The case is an attack on the majority of European consumers, who have rejected GE foods.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration today announced the first formal step
towards a WTO challenge against the European Union GE food policy.
According to a US Government press release, confirmed by
Wellington, the case has third party support from the New Zealand
Government (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It seems ridiculous that our Government is attacking instead of
defending Europe's right to regulate their own food and
agriculture," said Greenpeace New Zealand Campaigner Steve Abel.
"All countries are entitled to safe, natural food and have the
right to refuse GE foods and demand mandatory labelling of GE
products."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our Government should immediately withdraw from the US
case."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The US administration is effectively declaring a war on
consumers. But it is a war the US will not win. To launch a WTO
case to help the desperate genetic engineering industry to market
its unwanted GE products is an insult to the European public.
Greenpeace strongly condemns this blatant attempt to bully the
European Union and is confident that this will only serve to
reinforce consumer rejection of GMOs, which is the real cause of US
loss of markets,"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The European Union holds the moral high ground defending the
rights of a large majority of its citizens, as opposed to the US
administration, which is using the WTO to defend narrow industry
interests at the expense of the environment and people's right to
choose what they eat."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU's powerful response to the US challenge confirms that
consumer rejection is the real reason for GE's failure in Europe:
"It is the lack of consumer demand for GM products that accounts
for the low sales of GMOs in the EU market," the EU Commissioner
for Health and Consumer Protection David Byrne said (2).&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has created a deck of cards to help the public, governments and weapons inspectors identify the real weapons proliferators.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has issued the cards to Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) delegates in Geneva, with ID photos of the eight major
nuclear proliferators to provide guidance on who should be
eliminating their nuclear arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presidents Bush, Putin, Hu Jintao, Chirac, Musharraf and Prime
Ministers Blair, Vajpayee and Sharon - the leaders of the US,
Russia, China, France, Pakistan, India, UK, India and Israel, are
together responsible for the production and deployment of more than
36,000 nuclear bombs globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These states are in material breach of the NPT and of an
International Court of Justice ruling that the use and threat of
use of nuclear weapons were illegal," said Glyn Walters, Greenpeace
New Zealand Campaign Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the US and UK justified their invasion of Iraq and
removal of the Saddam Hussein regime as a 'war for disarmament',
they have failed to find evidence of any significant weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They have ignored their own obligations to disarm under the Non
Proliferation Treaty, and apply double standards when it comes to
the nuclear and other WMD arsenals of states such as Israel, India
and Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is representing the millions of people from all over
the world who want to see intensive scrutiny and elimination of not
only Iraq's and other so called "rogue states'" suspected arsenals
of nuclear weapons, but the elimination of all them, no matter who
possesses them.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Greenpeace congratulated Pete Hodgson on his support for renewable energy projects after the announcement of Te Apiti wind farm project by Meridian Energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We're encouraged to see the Minister of Energy pointing out the
huge potential of wind power for New Zealand's future energy
needs," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson. "New
Zealand should proudly be heading towards a wind-powered future.
Clearly options like burning dirty coal and other fossil fuels are
antiquated and out of line with our Kyoto Protocol commitments and
protecting the world's climate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) name carbon
dioxide, created when fossil fuels such as coal and oil are burnt,
to be a significant greenhouse gas influencing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Wind is free. Wind generated power could be one of the cheapest
sources of electricity when carbon taxes hits coal and other fossil
fuel forms of generation. But the Government must put in place
mechanisms to move New Zealand to a 100% renewable future," said
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to further announcements from the Government as
to how they will build renewables into a response to the current
energy crisis by moving New Zealand to a clean green energy
future".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Government's Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Authority (EECA), "…the total long-term potential [for wind energy
generation] has been assessed to be in the order of 100,000
gigawatt hours per year, three times our present generation."
[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has one of the best wind resources in the world -
the present New Zealand project announcement is only the tip of the
iceberg in the future of wind energy here," concluded Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 1 May the biggest wind farm development in the Southern
Hemisphere was announced in Australia. The 180 MW Portland Wind
Energy Project will be actively generating pollution-free power for
100,000 homes by mid-2005.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three Greenpeace activists have been arrested after police cut them away from blockading the entry point of the Auckland International Airport Incinerator.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The action was taken to prevent trucks from entering the site
with waste that would be incinerated. The burning of waste creates
deadly dioxins. Despite being within the 'legal limit' of
polluting, dioxins from the incinerator are continuing to poison
the community and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dioxins are among the most poisonous substances known and there
is no proven safe level of emissions", said Greenpeace Toxics
Campaigner Carmen Gravatt. "It is ridiculous that Auckland Airport
continues to gamble with our health and the environment, when safe
and economically viable alternatives exist."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Suzette Jackson, Steve Abel and Sarah Duthie are in
the Manukau District Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is demanding the facility be replaced with a clean
alternative and that the New Zealand Government ban incineration
nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

	Environment Minister, Marion Hobbs' reaction to the new economic report on GE, draws the wrong conclusions by ignoring the most important findings and continuing to advocate economic and environmental roulette for New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is satisfied that the initial research was conducted
well, asking the right questions to the right people in the right
places", said Greenpeace GE spokesperson Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However the Minister has chosen not to focus on points where
she would be acting to protect the environment and the economic
interests of New Zealand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This stems from 'we've-already-made-up-our-mind' syndrome, a
dangerous condition considering the report warns that New Zealand
has potentially great economic risks and opportunities attached to
the path it adopts on GM (pg 5 para 1)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yet given the choice between producing food that people want
(GE free) or producing foods that people don't want (GE), Hobbs is
pushing New Zealand to do the latter".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells should be ringing for government and industry on
these key points in the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Rejection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* A review of 102 opinion polls since 1992 generally showed
little shift in [negative] public sentiment about GM food since
1998 (Pg 6 para 2 &amp;amp;3, pg 11 para 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Between 20% to 30% of consumers state they would cease
purchasing New Zealand commodities if New Zealand released GMO's
(executive summary)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Studies examining performance of GE food crops in farm
production have suggested that productivity gains are small or even
absent (pg. 7 para 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unknown technology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The relative newness of the technology means there is some
uncertainty as to the present level of costs and benefits (pg 5
para 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value of Clean Green Image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* One third of all respondents stated their image of the New
Zealand environment would get worse if GMO pest controls or
livestock feed was released (pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* One third of all respondents stated their image of the New
Zealand environment would improve if New Zealand did not use GMO's
(Pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's greatest economic advantage is in being a GE free
producer," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite efforts to disguise it, two government reports on GE released today expose the degree to which the Government is blundering towards what could be an economic and agricultural disaster in allowing the contamination of New Zealand's environment with GE from October this year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The reports show the Government's perilous denial of two GE
facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Co-existence of GE and conventional crops is impossible
because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE spread in the agricultural environment is inevitable due to
the nature of seed and pollen drift and human fallibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The world's consumers don't want GE foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, these make GE release obviously a bad idea. Yet they
are hidden and twisted within government reports to conclude GE
release should occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whilst MAF acknowledges that pollen movement can only be
'minimised' not 'ruled out completely' it has clearly taken on the
task of doing Monsanto's dirty work by lobbying for acceptance of
GE contamination in conventional crops," said Greenpeace GE
Campaigner Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The economic survey showing that up to 30% of foreign customers
would 'cease purchasing NZ commodities or holidays if NZ released
GMO's' should be ringing major alarm bells in Wellington," said
Abel. "No one would disagree that such a loss of custom would have
a devastating impact on New Zealand's economy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Claims that such losses could be countered by productivity
increases are entirely hypothetical, whereas consumer and market
rejection of GE food is a fact."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What's more, foods containing GE ingredients are one of the
most widely rejected product groups ever."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What is the value of increasing productivity of something the
world doesn't want?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"MAF also proposes a complex array of regulations and transport
and storage mechanisms to 'minimise' cross contamination. This
shows a stunning ignorance of human fallibility and natural
processes. Put simply - you can't control the wind and people make
mistakes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Read in combination with the mass of information available, the
reports reveal that GE is poison to our billion dollar Clean Green
status and the only possible way to stop GE contamination is to
keep GE in the lab," concluded Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	Environment and health groups joined forces today with the organic agriculture industry, to alert the electorate to the implications of the approaching General Election for our agriculture and food industry. Representatives of the groups are calling for an organic, GE free New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Soil and Health, BIO-GRO, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Safe
Food Campaign, RAGE, Natural Food Commission, Pesticides Action
Network, and Toxins Awareness Group, called on voters today to
decide what future they want for their food before casting their
vote on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The next Government will be the one responsible for deciding
which path New Zealand is going to take - will it be a risk-laden,
genetically polluting path, with unknown consequences, or an
organic future, with economic as well as social and environmental
benefits? The two cannot co-exist, and choices made now in favour
of genetically engineered crops will be made forever. If we go the
genetic way we will be tied to health-destroying chemical
pesticides forever' said Meriel Watts, from Soil and Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'With Monsanto waiting in the wings for the Election result
before they apply for the first commercially grown GE crop in New
Zealand, this is the election at which we decide what future we
want for agriculture in New Zealand. This is a now or never
decision, as the results of genetic pollution are not only
unpredictable but also irreversible' said Tricia Allen, Campaigns
Director, Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The unknown risks to our health and environment which
genetically engineered food and crops pose are too high a price to
pay. It's not needed, it's not wanted - it's time it was banned
altogether' said Wendy Johnson, Friends of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The food of the future already exists - it's called organics.
Modern organic agriculture is growing fast across the globe, with
demand outstripping supply in many countries. But it will need
Government commitment, with visionary targets and growth strategies
- combined with a rejection of GE crops - if New Zealand is to
maximise the opportunities' said Elspeth McMillan, CEO, BIO-GRO New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A National victory at the election will open the way for
Monsanto to press ahead with their application to grow genetically
engineered canola, which has been pending since May this year. A
Labour victory will impose a one year ban on this application,
whilst a Royal Commission of Inquiry is carried out. The Alliance
and the Green Party are calling for a moratorium on GE crops, while
ACT and NZ First have no formal policy on commercially grown GE
crops.&lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland airport's "legal" levels of dioxin production will not protect the community from these poisonous chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects and endometriosis, Greenpeace said today, as it shut down the facility.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning Greenpeace blocked trucks of quarantine and medical
waste from entering the incinerator at Auckland International
Airport (AIAL). Three activists locked on to barrels bolted into
the ground to prevent trucks entering the site. Two more activists
hung a banner on the building reading "Stop Poisoning us. Stop
Incineration". Greenpeace is demanding the facility be replaced and
that the New Zealand Government ban incineration nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins are among the most poisonous substances known and there
is no proven safe level of emissions. They are a by- product of the
incineration process, and are not created by other waste disposal
methods, such as steam sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Auckland Airport incinerator is the largest incinerator in
the country and potentially the nation's largest single dioxin
source," said Greenpeace toxics campaigner Carmen Gravatt. "Other
major incinerators in the country have switched to steam
sterilisation and Auckland must follow suit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's action highlights the on-going concern of local
residents, airport shareholders and the wider community that the
company is not doing enough, fast enough to make the switch to
clean technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is astounding that a company as profitable as AIAL refuses
to switch its toxic incinerator to steam sterilisation. AIAL are
dismissing the widespread concern of the local community and their
shareholders, and the progressive commitments of other incinerator
companies across the country," said Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins cause cancer, diabetes and birth defects and interrupt
hormone and immune systems. In 2001, the New Zealand Government
signed the international Stockholm Convention, which aims to
eliminate dioxins, and lists incineration as a key source of
dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Despite signing this convention, the Government allows AIAL to
continue polluting the Auckland community with a significant and
totally unnecessary source of dioxins. The Government must honour
the Stockholm Convention and ban incineration in New Zealand," said
Gravatt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is unacceptable that both AIAL, a company that prides itself
on being a good corporate citizen and the New Zealand Government,
which constantly promotes our clean green image, both continue to
back incineration."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists, including three New Zealanders, this morning blocked an Australian naval vessel, HMAS Sydney, departing for Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A flotilla of yachts, small craft and kayakers, along with
swimmers and divers blocked the ship's route out of Sydney Harbour
as a protest against Australia's partcipation in this and future
US-led wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is deeply concerned about the precedent this war
sets internationally. Will New Zealand and Australian troops be
asked to commit to more pre-emptive wars led by the US?", said
Steve Abel Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Prime Minister Helen Clark has rightly refused to support this
illegal US-led war. Will future New Zealand governments accede to
US requests to attack Syria, North Korea or Iran? Australia should
not commit any more troops to war in Iraq or support more US wars
of aggression."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Director of the CIA, a possible candidate to administer
post-war Iraq, James Woolsey, publicly stated (2 April) that this
is the beginning of World War IV and advocated 'regime change' in
Iran and Syria. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Kristol, Chairman of the US 'think-tank' behind US
Foreign Policy, the 'Project for a New American Century', of which
US Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and Paul
Wolfowitz have been members, speaks of the Bush Administration
'enshrining in official policy the tactic of military pre-emption,
the objective of regime change, and the vision of American Power
that is fully engaged and never apologetic' (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'It is clear the US Government is rewriting the rules of
international affairs based on the exertion of US military power.
This is a turning point in world affairs - all democratic and
peace-seeking countries should be alarmed at this new direction",
said Mr Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	The decision by a French court to lift an injunction against the use of a parody logo on the StopEsso website was an important victory for free speech on the internet, a victory for the climate, and evidence that Esso's strategy to silence critics using the courts was futile, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In July 2002, Esso France began legal action against Greenpeace
in France over the StopEsso website, which uses a logo featuring a
double dollar sign ($$) in place of the double "S" in the oil
giant's red and blue logo. StopEsso, a global coalition of groups
including Greenpeace, is campaigning around the world to stop Esso
from sabotaging international action to address climate change and
has used the logo since the campaign was launched in May 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso is sabotaging climate protection in order to continue its
dirty business and has attempted to use the courts to silence its
critics. Today that strategy failed," said Greenpeace International
campaigner Stephanie Tunmore. "Esso is one of the world's most
profitable companies and uses its big bucks to get what it wants,
from spending millions on lobbying the White House to drop the
Kyoto Protocol, to buying junk science and advertising campaigns
that try to confuse the public about global warming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July last year, a French judge upheld Esso's bid to get the
logo taken off the Greenpeace France website. But after hearing
Greenpeace's appeal, Justice Lacabarats in Paris found that
StopEsso's use of the logo was allowable under the right to free
speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar case over use of parody logos on the internet was
heard in France on the same day as the StopEsso logo case, when
French nuclear company Areva sought to sue Greenpeace in France and
New Zealand over a parody logo used on the web. The court upheld a
previous decision that this logo was allowable, again citing
freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso had earlier claimed that a double dollar sign logo
associated the company with the Nazi SS, but this was rejected by
the court at a preliminary hearing. Esso had demanded the
withdrawal of all the logos, a penalty of 80,000 Euros a day for
reputational damage and 80,000 Euro per day per logo if Greenpeace
failed to comply. It also demanded removal of all use of the term
"StopEsso".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is Esso's own behaviour interfering in international action
on climate change that is damaging its reputation, rather than
anything Greenpeace is doing," said Tunmore. "Trying to trample
over the right to freedom of expression in an attempt to shut us
down has only attracted further condemnation".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling on the US, UK and Australia to return to the rule of international law and not to embark on other US-led wars in the Middle East or elsewhere.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Commentators, US think-tanks close to the American
Administration and the former Director of the CIA, James Woolsey,
have been suggesting Iraq may be just the first of a series of wars
against states in the Middle East and beyond. Many observers are
concerned the next targets are those identified by the US in the
'axis of evil' as Iran and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfield yesterday again warned
Syria, claiming it continues to supply Iraq with military equipment
and that the US considers "…such trafficking as hostile acts and
will hold the Syrian Government accountable..." [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iraq war was waged despite failure to obtain Security
Council authorisation for the use of force in violation of the UN
Charter provisions, designed after WWII to prevent aggressive acts.
Greenpeace believes the United States own defiance of international
law [2] is sending a signal to states such as North Korea - that
compliance with international conventions and international law are
optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of North Korea's formal withdrawal from the Nuclear
Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Greenpeace and 37 non-governmental
organisations (NGO's) called on all members of the UN Security
Council to support a negotiated settlement over the conflict
between North Korea and the United States [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NPT, which includes the vast majority of the world's states
and all nuclear weapons states except Israel, India and Pakistan,
will next meet at the United Nations in Geneva from April 28 - May
9 to start planning a formal review of the NPT scheduled for
2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NGOs said that the crisis in the non-proliferation regime
must urgently be addressed at the meeting and that member states
must commit to multilateral treaty-based non-proliferation
mechanisms to prevent any repeat of unilateral action, such as that
taken by the US and the UK against Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The world has seen more than enough violence. It is time to
make law, not war", said Steve Abel, Greenpeace New Zealand
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2934287.stm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] The US has withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, undermined and
failed to sign the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions
verification protocols, refused to ratify and 'unsigned' the
Statute of the International Criminal Court and famously refused to
ratify the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] In a letter sent today to the UN Security Council, as they
held a formal "consultation" on North Korea issues, NGOs called for
a strengthened non-proliferation regime and on the U.S. and other
nuclear weapons states to stop evading their disarmament
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the same day the New Zealand Government releases its reports on the economic and co- existence issues relating to genetically engineered (GE) crops here, a new report on the world's biggest GE crop producer, Monsanto, shows their financial prospects are poor – due to consumer rejection of GE foods and the potential liability costs of inevitable contamination from GE crops.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The agrochemical giant Monsanto has received the lowest possible
environmental and strategic management rating of a triple-C from
Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, a global environmental and
social investment research firm. Innovest's report, "Monsanto and
Genetic Engineering: Risks to Investors," commissioned by
Greenpeace, will be released at a briefing at the Harvard Club in
New York City tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, which comes just days before Monsanto's annual
general meeting, warns shareholders and potential investors of
Monsanto's "above average risk exposure and less sophisticated
management than peers." Innovest analysts predict that "it
[Monsanto] will likely under-perform in the market over the mid to
long-term."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto suffered $1.7 billion in losses in 2002 and has failed
to open new markets for its controversial GE products. Yet Monsanto
continues to pursue its unsound business strategy of betting on a
speedy and widespread global acceptance of GE foods. Next in the
Monsanto pipeline is GE wheat, which is being boycotted in key
markets by farmers and food industry even before its approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While last year's profit losses led to a change in leadership
at the company, they did not lead to a change in strategy. If
Monsanto does not take steps to mitigate its substantial market
risks, further investor losses are likely," said Frank Dixon,
Managing Director at Innovest Strategic Value Advisors. "The risk
of heavy financial losses due to genetic pollution or technology
failure coupled with sustained market rejection of GE foods makes
Monsanto a poor investment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand faces the same risks as Monsanto if we pursue GE
release here," said Greenpeace New Zealand GE Campaigner Steve
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The key issues that are making GE a poor financial prospect for
Monsanto are market rejection and the potential cost of inevitable
seed and pollen spread in the agricultural environment," said
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These are exactly the issues that the New Zealand Government is
in denial over. We stand to lose our invaluable GE free production
status."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its assessment of Monsanto's key markets, Innovest
underscores the lack of regulatory approval and stiff consumer
opposition that continue to block the company's GE crops. GE
products constitute one of the most widely rejected product groups
ever, and major food importers such as China, Japan and Korea have
recently followed the restrictive European approach. In the US,
upwards of 90 per cent of consumers now demand GE food to be
labelled and many would reject GE food if given the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovest analysis of the risks and liabilities associated
with Monsanto's genetic engineering business pays special attention
to the inevitability of GE contamination. Referring to the example
of the StarLink corn contamination scandal in 2000, in which the
company Aventis lost $1 billion, Innovest estimated Monsanto's
potential financial fallout from a "StarLink scenario" to be $3.83
liability per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Monsanto's cash cow remains its agrochemical business, but last
year's 24% drop in sales of Round-up and other non-selective
herbicides has left the company vulnerable and increasingly
desperate. Monsanto appears to be digging its own grave with its GE
strategy," said Greenpeace global markets specialist Lindsay
Keenan.&lt;/p&gt;

	Following an open letter in the Christchurch Press and hundreds of emails from Greenpeace supporters, Nuplex Medismart yesterday issued a press statement announcing their intention to close their incinerator at Christchurch airport and move to steam sterilisation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite much more extensive pressure from local residents and
shareholders, Auckland International Airport Ltd (AIAL) refuses to
upgrade their incinerator to clean technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is astounding that a company as profitable as AIAL refuses
to switch their toxic incinerator to steam sterilisation. AIAL are
dismissing the widespread concern of the local community and their
shareholders and the progressive commitments of other incinerator
companies across the country," said Carmen Gravatt, Greenpeace
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Auckland International Airport continue to roll out excuses and
drag their heels on incineration."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Auckland Airport incinerator is the largest incinerator in
the country and potentially the nation's largest single dioxin
source (1). Incineration releases dioxins, which cause cancer,
diabetes and birth defects and interrupt hormone and immune
systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other major incinerators in Auckland, Dunedin and Wellington
have already changed to steam sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Government has signed the Stockholm Convention,
which aims to eliminate dioxins, and lists incineration as a key
source of dioxins. Yet despite this they are allowing AIAL to
continue polluting the Auckland community with a significant and
totally unnecessary source of dioxins. The Government must honour
the Stockholm Convention and ban incineration in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is unacceptable that both AIAL, a company that prides itself
on being a good corporate citizen and the New Zealand Government,
which constantly promotes our clean green image, both continue to
back incineration."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Inadequate monitoring and underestimates of levels in ash
and scrubber residues suggest that AIAL could be the largest single
dioxin source in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year Greenpeace and South Auckland communities
have been campaigning for AIAL to close down its incinerator and
change to steam sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace presented the argument for a clean alternative
through a shareholder resolution at AIAL's Annual General Meeting
in November 2002. While it did not formally pass there was
significant support for the spirit of the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIAL agreed to fulfil the demand of the Manukau City Council,
its third largest shareholder, that the company urgently
investigate alternative ways of treating its waste. However at this
stage they have failed to make real change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 31 2003 is the deadline for the abatement notice AIAL have
been served by the Auckland Regional Council. This means that they
are required to prove that the incinerator is now under the dioxin
standard, which it has been breaching for over two years. However
there is no safe level of dioxins and Greenpeace will continue to
oppose any level of dioxin emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

	JOINT LETTER to the PRIME MINISTER from:
Combined Trade Unions (CTU), ECO (representing 65 environment organisations), Greenpeace, Peace Foundation, The Body Shop NZ, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Aotearoa)
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Hon Helen Clark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament Buildings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wellington&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 February 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisations cited call on you to act urgently and
unequivocally in support of a peaceful resolution to the crisis
over Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We urge that the New Zealand Government now declare its support
for the proposal being put to the UN Security Council on Friday 14
February by the Governments of France, Germany and Russia for
extended inspection and disarmament teams in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding war and peacefully disarming Iraq of its weapons of
mass destruction is possible. It now requires international leaders
such as yourself to strongly advocate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your address to the opening of Parliament made no mention of the
proposal cited above for peacefully disarming Iraq, referring only
to work by 'Government officials' on post-war clean-up
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speak of New Zealand's possible engagement in post-war
reconstruction and make no mention of how New Zealand is engaged
with the international momentum behind the Franco-German-Russian
proposal is insufficient. As a Prime Minister with a history of
peace activism, and from a country and political party known for
standing internationally for justice your voice is now needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Government must now call on the world community,
particularly the US, Australia and Britain, to exhaust every means
available to peacefully, rather than militarily, disarm Iraq, and
as you state in your speech, 'prevent the catastrophe which war
would bring.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the New Zealand Government now actively endorse the
peaceful disarmament proposal to be tabled by the Governments of
France, Germany and Russia on Friday 14 February?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your earliest response to this joint letter is sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, on behalf of the organisations above,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margaret Crozier&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace flew an 18 by 6 metre 'No War, Peace Now' banner above the opening of the America's Cup yacht challenge today to promote peace, as protest against a war in Iraq spread around the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Millions of people around the world are rallying today to say
no to war, and New Zealand is the first country to send this
message," said Robbie Kelman, Greenpeace anti-war spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Countries like New Zealand must add their weight to efforts for
a peaceful solution to this crisis. The proposal by France, Germany
and Russia for peacefully disarming Iraq presents a clear choice
for Helen Clark. She must now choose this option over war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most New Zealanders are against war and proud of our
international disarmament legacy. New Zealand must stay true to its
values and oppose any act of aggression when diplomatic options
still exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 15 has been declared a global day of protest against war in
Iraq, rallies for peace will be held all around the world
including, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.&lt;/p&gt;

	"Coal is not a feasible replacement for Maui Gas which is expected to run out in 2007," said Robbie Kelmen, Greenpeace climate campaigner.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The idea that coal can replace Maui gas is ludicrous. The
Government's global warming obligations must be towards developing
new renewable energy sources and , not rely on coal, which
contributes heavily to global warming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicity around the evaporation of Maui gas has highlighted the
lack of a Government Energy Strategy. The Government cannot divorce
energy and climate change strategies, the two are intimately
linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"An energy strategy must be Government-lead, include Kyoto
Protocol obligations and logically include wind energy which New

	Greenpeace GE spokesperson Steve Abel today described the Governments GE precautions as "like a condom with holes: destined to fail".
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The environment minister has ignored the mass of international
information about how uncontrollable GE organisms are, and is
blindly heading for GE release and so jeopardising our invaluable
GE-free production status and the integrity of our unique
environment. What a legacy for an environment minister to leave -
that she presided over the release of GE organisms into our land
and food chain," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is so obsessed with its "knowledge economy" that
it has lost grip on basic economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65 percent of our economy is based on primary production and a
further 20 percent on tourism both of which depend on our clean
green reputation; re-branding New Zealand as "New GE Land" is
stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE is perceived by consumers world wide as like having radiation
in your butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes the concept of "conditional release" is
deeply flawed and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping GE in containment is the only safe, scientifically,
environmentally and economically defensible course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a full liability regime for GE reflects the reality
that economic and environmental risks are at the end of the day
irreversible and can't be compensated, and this itself shows why GE
organisms should not be released into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	"Ag Research is dreaming if they think their genetically engineered cows milk will 'translate into substantial economic gains'. Consumers have rejected GE food crops the world over. GE dairy products will most certainly meet the same fate," said Greenpeace GE Campaigner Steve Abel today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ag Research claim they have cloned genetically engineered cows
to produce extra casein that may have commercial applications in
butter and cheese production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no point producing something that nobody wants to
buy," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major food companies like Unilever Australasia have non-GE feed
policies for their dairy products. And pro-GE dairy giant Fonterra
has acknowledged the lack of GE food markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The GE milk experiment at Ruakura jeopardises New Zealand's
billion dollar clean green image, on which our dairy industry is
marketed," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand butter is marketed in the UK as 'Anchored in Nature'
and 'Free Range'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Britons would stop buying NZ butter if they thought it was GE
derived," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Markets are sensitive. The Government and Fonterra should be
giving clear assurances here and overseas that New Zealand's dairy
production remains GE-free."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace opposes the release of GMOs into the environment and
food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand Ambassador's speech to the UN General Assembly tomorrow must back a peaceful resolution to the crisis over Iraq – that means actively supporting the Governments of France, Germany and Russia.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Helen Clark has so far failed to actively support the
Franco-German proposal for peacefully disarming Iraq," said Robbie
Kelman, Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In times of crisis, the world does not need fence-sitters. The
Prime Minister's avoidance of active support for countries
advancing the cause of peace is in stark contrast to her history as
a peace activist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A pre-emptive strike against Iraq would be illegal and
unprecedented. International leaders such as Helen Clark must stand
up in opposition to the war machine headed by the US, Britain and
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has an alternative proposal it could endorse. Helen
Clark must instruct our Ambassador to the UN to stand alongside
France, Germany and Russia," Kelman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning Greenpeace again took action from aboard the
Rainbow Warrior to prevent more US military equipment being loaded
and shipped from Antwerp, Belgium. Ten Greenpeace activists climbed
onto one of the harbour's lock gates to seal it shut. Other
activists drove inflatable boats across the opening of the second
lock gate to prevent four ships loaded with military equipment
bound for the Gulf leaving the harbour, and a US navy vessel
entering it to be loaded. Several activists were arrested but have
since been released without charge.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today expressed its support for the proceedings filed in the High Court by Mothers Against Genetic Engineering (MAdGE) against AgResearch's human-gene-cow experiment approved by ERMA last year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;MAdGE has deep concerns about the environmental, economic and
health risks of the controversial GE cow experiment and is strongly
challenging the idea that New Zealand's regulatory system is being
been applied with appropriate rigour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was one of over 800 submitters who opposed the
AgResearch experiment last year, and questioned the direction of
the Government's research stating that the experiment "opened the
farm gate to GE cows and GE milk for human consumption."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Important questions about the environmental impacts, potentials
for new diseases and ethical and economic impacts of GE remain
unanswered by the Environmental Risk Management Authority's
approval process. ERMA has approved all applications to date and
admitted to lacking sufficient expertise or knowledge to deal with
mandatory ethical considerations," said GE campaigner, Steve
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These are very concerning gaps in New Zealand's regulatory
rigour as ERMA faces a potential inundation of applications for
release of GE crops and animals towards the end of this year when
the moratorium on commercial release is due to be lifted, " said
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

engineered organisms into the environment and food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today launched a unique web site, Zoom on Doom, mapping the location of all known nuclear weapons facilities and storage sites around the world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Since the US and UK are having such difficulty finding weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq, we thought we'd lend a hand by
providing this easy guide to the nuclear weapons we know about,
with their coordinates," said Stephanie Mills, Greenpeace
International nuclear campaign coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All information in the map is drawn from publicly available
sources, but this site is believed to be unique in providing one
global map with the exact coordinates of all known nuclear weapons
facilities and storage sites."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Preparatory Committee is
meeting at the United Nations in Geneva until 9 May. There are
currently around 30,000 nuclear bombs globally. Since 1970 when the
Treaty was signed, only 1500 bombs have been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week Greenpeace conducted 'inspections' at the US, French,
Russian and Israeli missions in Geneva. Today the inspectors,
together with 'mock missiles' visited the UK and China missions -
both official nuclear weapon states. They also visited the missions
of India, Pakistan and North Korea, demanding these countries
renounce their nuclear weapons programmes and join the NPT as
non-nuclear weapons states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"State parties to the NPT have the responsibility to respect
international law and guarantee a world free of nuclear weapons,"
said Ms Mills. "Unfortunately, the NPT's official nuclear countries
- UK, US, China, France and Russia - have failed to comply with the
NPT."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the nuclear powers are seriously concerned about the WMDs of
India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea, they must lead by example
by immediately cutting their arsenals and halting plans to build
new nuclear weapons," said Ms Mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace strongly recommends delegates at the NPT meeting
agree five major proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- States should reject the use of military force to resolve
proliferation concerns, and uphold the value of multilateral legal
mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- States should reject the 'first strike' use of nuclear
weapons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- All nuclear weapon states should commit to eliminating their
illegal nuclear arsenals and halting the development of new nuclear
weapons or the 'refurbishment' of existing ones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- States should agree an emergency mechanism to deal more
swiftly and effectively with future crises such as North Korea's
withdrawal from the NPT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- States should stop the promotion of 'dual use' for energy and
weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand has issued an open letter to Prime Minister Helen Clark urging her to take a more pro-active stand against the impending war in Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Prime Minister must voice our county's opposition to war.
Will New Zealand remain silent while the United States pushes the
United Nations into a war with Iraq?" said Robbie Kelman,
Greenpeace New Zealand spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has also taken peaceful direct action in Australia,
France and the UK as part of an ongoing campaign against war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Greenpeace volunteers entered Southampton's Marchwood
Military Port. Seven were arrested but five managed to climb inside
tanks about to be loaded onto supply ships, destined for the Gulf,
and secured the hatches behind them. Two more activists chained
themselves to the tanks. Three New Zealand activists were
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Toulouse harbour, France, Greenpeace activists, protested the
departure of military aircraft carrier to Turkey and demanded
President Chirac explain why he is sending aircraft to Turkey given
that he is publicly opposed to military action in Iraq. In
Australia, activists inflated a hot air balloon outside Parliament
House in Canberra demanding that the Australian Government stop
sending troops to Iraq and to 'give peace a chance'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Rainbow Warrior, in Southhampton, Kiwi crew
member, Phil Lloyd said: "Greenpeace will use every peaceful means
available to try and stop an attack on Iraq. An attack would lead
to massive civilian suffering and increase the threat that weapons
of mass destruction will be used."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush and Blair have cited Saddam Hussein's desire to acquire
weapons of mass destruction as justification for an invasion.
However, pre-emptive military strikes against states possessing or
suspected of possessing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons do
not provide a basis for controlling them. It would require repeated
armed interventions against numerous countries. The five nuclear
powers are Britain, the US, China, France and Russia. Other states
known to have nuclear weapons include India, Pakistan and Israel.
The Bush administration has claimed that at least 13 countries are
pursuing biological weapons research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes the solution to the threat weapons of mass
destruction is collective international arms control and
disarmament. The framework already exists, in the form of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Biological Weapons
Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. But rather than
being strengthened, these global treaties are being undermined,
especially by the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear motivation for this war is oil. The same U.S.
companies that maintain America's oil addiction and oppose the
Kyoto Protocol are also backing the war against Iraq. A wave of
protests against war for oil are scheduled to take place in the
U.S. later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been trying to stop the build up of the UK's
military machine for over a week. On Monday 28th January
Greenpeace's the Rainbow Warrior blockaded the military port to
prevent Ministry of Defence chartered supply ships from leaving. On
Wednesday 30th Greenpeace volunteers boarded the vessel the MV Lyra
as it lay anchored in the Solent with a cargo of military vehicles.
Both protests ended in the face of extreme weather conditions. On
Saturday 2nd February the Rainbow Warrior resumed its peace
blockade of the military docks until the ship was stormed by police
who cut her anchor chain and used powerful tugs to force her into a
berth.&lt;/p&gt;

	Spectator boats were greeted by Greenpeace inflatables and yacht Tiama with large anti-nuclear banners as nuclear company Areva boat Defi-Areva raced in the Louis Vuitton Cup today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tiama and Greenpeace inflatables moved amongst the spectator and
media boats informing about Areva's true activities and why
Greenpeace is opposed to their involvement in the Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiama was part of the Nuclear Free Tasman flotilla last year and
again this year when 12 boats sailed out to protest the transport
of plutonium fuel and waste through our region. An Areva company
was responsible for the 2001 shipment and British Nuclear Fuels for
the shipment that arrived this month in the UK after worldwide
opposition to the transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to Areva's sponsorship because their group
of companies are shipping plutonium and nuclear waste through our
region, pollute the marine environment with radioactive waste on a
daily basis and are involved in the development of nuclear weapons
through their majority owner the French Atomic Energy
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is inappropriate for an industry with a history and current
practice of contaminating the environment to try and clean up its
image by associating itself with the clean, green image of
sailing," said Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace Nuclear
spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva was formed in 2001 from a merger between the plutonium
reprocessing company COGEMA, the nuclear reactor construction
company Framatome, and FCI, a maker of electrical connectors. Areva
is 78.96 percent owned by the Commissariat a L'Énergie Atomique
(CEA - the French Atomic Energy Commission) and 5.19 percent owned
by the French government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Areva is here to re-launch itself and make new business using
the French sailing team, the America's Cup and nuclear-free New
Zealand as the venue. Behind the name is an industry with a
terrible environmental record and which is intimately involved in
the nuclear weapons business," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Vote buying by the Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) has forced the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to convene a special meeting in Cambridge (UK) today, said Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The special meeting, only the fifth in over 50 years, has been
set to determine whether the IWC can now agree to grant an
aboriginal subsistence quota to the Alaskan Eskimos and Russian
Chukotka peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Eskimos and other indigenous peoples who hunt whales for
subsistance do not fall under the IWC's moratorium on commercial
whaling and quotas. These are based on scientific advice and are
usually agreed by consensus. However, at the last IWC meeting,
Japan tried to link the joint Russian/US aboriginal subsistance
quota to a commercial quota for its own whalers and then used a
bloc of bought votes [1] to block the subsistence quota when its
own commercial request was not granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Fisheries Agency of Japan was clearly attempting to
blackmail the US by using the vote bought countries to block the
aboriginal quota," said Richard Page, Greenpeace Oceans campaigner.
"They have said they will allow the quota to pass at this meeting,
but there is no guarantee that the Fisheries Agency won't employ
this tactic at future meetings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan's (FAJ) use of development aid to
buy votes in the IWC is well documented with both senior Japanese
officials and representatives of bought countries admitting to the
practice (1). By this means the FAJ now commands a blocking
minority within the IWC. Under the IWC's rules, a minority of over
25% can block a quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government of Japan is set on buying a return to commercial
whaling," said Page. "Unless action is taken to stop vote buying,
they may succeed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservationists fear that the vote buying offensive may spread
into other conservation bodies. Japan has proposed that the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
should end its ban on trade in whale products and has called for a
vote at the next CITES meeting in November.&lt;/p&gt;

the meeting's start. Benin and Gabon have recently received

	"The suggestion by Pacific Seeds regional boss Howard Morris that New Zealand taxpayers should pay for the cost of someone else's GE pollution is ridiculous," said Steve Abel, Greenpeace GE campaigner.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The regional director of Pacific Seeds Howard Morris stated on
Radio New Zealand this morning: "When GE seeds are accidentally
imported the cost of managing the incident should be borne by the
community that has made the decision to remain GE free."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Abel said, "This statement by Mr Morris highlights the
failings of the Governments 'she'll be right' attitude to GE
liability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government public discussion paper on GE states [the Govt]
is 'not at this point proposing any changes in relation to
liability in respect of GMOs'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The current legal uncertainty leaves non-GE producers and the
public liable for the reckless spread of GE contamination by
biotech companies," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is this attitude that has left victims of dioxin
contamination from chemical companies liable for the costs of their
own healthcare," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE seed has contaminated all levels of the US agricultural
industry, which is where New Zealand's maize seed contaminations
originated. Law-suits are flying left, right and centre in the
States, where biotech companies are suing farmers for patent
infringement and farmers are suing biotech companies for
contamination of non-GE crops and loss of export markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This lack of clarity is not good for the economic confidence of
anyone on either side of the GE fence, said Abel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The reality is that unless it is made clear that GE companies
are liable for the economic or environmental harm they do through
contaminating non-GE producers - then the cost of contamination
will be borne by the innocent party - such as conventional or
organic farmers, or the public," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government must take a position on GE liability. It would be
anathema to most New Zealanders if the polluter was not held
responsible for their pollution so the "polluter pays" principle
must be the basis of any GE liability laws.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists in kayaks protested nuclear company Areva's involvement in the America's Cup as DefiAreva left the Viaduct Basin today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Twelve kayaks created a 'guard of shame' and flew banners saying
"Keep the cup nuclear-free" as the French boat left the entrance of
the Viaduct Basin to compete in first race of the Louis Vuitton
Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The arrogance of such a dangerous and dirty industry thinking
that they can come to nuclear free New Zealand and use this event
to promote their business can not go unchallenged," said Bunny
McDiarmid, Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People can put their heads in the sand and pretend Areva is
just another sponsor or they can take some responsibility to make
sure that the nuclear industry knows that they are not welcome
here. This could be as simple as flying a nuclear-free pennant
while watching the race," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an Areva company that discharges nuclear waste into the
ocean on a daily basis, and it was the same company that shipped
plutonium through our region last year despite our Government's
opposition. Areva is also intimately connected with the development
of the French nuclear weapons programme through its majority
shareholder, the French Atomic Energy Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

	Fonterra's pursuit of organic dairy is good news for the environment, human and livestock health and New Zealand's agricultural economy,Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Fonterra and Greenpeace don't see eye to eye on genetic
engineering of cows but we are glad to see Fonterra recognising the
'positive outlook for organics'", said Greenpeace GE campaigner
Steve Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand has a fantastic opportunity with our existing
reputation as a high quality natural food producer, to move our
agriculture towards real sustainability and at the same time cash
in on the global organic demand," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fonterra announced the production of its first organic dairy
product yesterday and stated; "the global organic foods business is
expected to exceed US$11 billion this year." and New Zealand sales
of organic products are growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is somewhat ironic that the UK Soil association recently
estimated that GE crops had cost the US economy US$11 billion in
subsidies and lost markets," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	For the second day, Greenpeace handed information about Areva, anti-nuclear pennants and nuke-free NZ biscuits to the spectator boats watching the Louis Vuitton Cup.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Two Greenpeace inflatables moved amongst the spectator and media
boats informing about Areva's true activities and why Greenpeace is
opposed to their involvement in the Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealanders need to know what Areva's real day-job is. This
company discharges nuclear waste into the ocean on a daily basis;
is intimately connected to the development of France's nuclear
weapons and has shipped nuclear materials through our region last
year despite our Government's opposition."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says it is easy to be pro-America's Cup and still be
anti-nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"All you have to do is fly anti-nuclear pennant on your boat
while watching the race and let the world know that New Zealand is
proudly nuclear-free."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has challenged Areva to a public debate, which Areva
has agreed to in a meeting with Greenpeace late last week. This
will occur when Areva returns in early November.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace said today that Auckland International Airport's (AIAL) plans to upgrade the quarantine waste incinerator by installing a heat exchanger is a completely inadequate response to its dioxin pollution problem.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Installing a heat exchanger is like putting a band aid over a
gun-shot wound," Sue Connor, Greenpeace campaigner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incinerator has been breaching its dioxin standard for over
two years but the Auckland Regional Council has now issued an
abatement notice requiring the incinerator to comply with the
law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an excellent opportunity for AIAL to commit to treating
its quarantine waste with a cleaner technology such as steam
sterilisation, rather than this totally inadequate response which
continues investment in dirty incineration technology," said
Connor. "Greenpeace is calling on AIAL to make an immediate
commitment to closing the incinerator and installing a steam
steriliser within 12 months".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The South Auckland community does not want this incinerator. It
produces toxic pollution including cancer-causing dioxins, heavy
metals and furans that are polluting the people and environment of
South Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no safe level of dioxin, so it is very disappointing
that Labour MP Ross Robertson is supporting the company over
community concerns especially when there are other acceptable
methods to treat quarantine waste".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has signed an international treaty, the Stockholm
Convention, which aims to eliminate dioxin and which specifically
lists incineration as a source of dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Labour Government signed the Stockholm Convention and has
stated an intention to ratify it, so Mr Robertson has another good
reason to support the community demand for the incinerator to be
closed". &lt;/p&gt;

The leaked draft APEC declaration on climate change and energy confirms that John Howard and George Bush want to use the upcoming APEC meeting to derail international negotiations on continuing and strengthening the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. They are doing this to protect the Australian export coal industry, and American fossil fuel interests.

	Greenpeace open letter to Areva: Greenpeace challange Areva to debate Jacques Emmanuel Saulnier, Senior Executive, Vice President, AREVA
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Saulnier,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Bunny McDiarmid and I work for Greenpeace on the
nuclear campaign. Our organisation is opposed to the activities of
the company you represent because of the negative impact they have
on human health and the environment and the serious risk they pose
for nuclear proliferation. It is for these reasons that we are also
opposed to your company's use of the Louis Vuitton yacht race in
New Zealand to promote Areva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it is disingenuous of your company to present itself
as just an energy company when your activities and associations
cover everything from mining interests to the development of
Frances nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you were in New Zealand in February you told the media that
you were interested and ready to debate these issues. I am
therefore inviting you to do this. I understand that there are a
number of media outlets that would be interested in such a
debate.&lt;/p&gt;

GE Free rally confirmed</title><date>2002-10-08 00:00:00</date><text>
	Greenpeace and the Auckland GE Free Coalition have confirmed a GE Free rally and march for November 16 in Auckland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The event will begin at Aotea Square at 12 noon on Saturday the
16th of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The message just doesn't seem to be getting through to the
Government, that the majority of New Zealanders don't want GE in
our food and farming," said Steve Abel, Greenpeace GE
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The stakes are very high with GE - it's the future of our whole
agricultural economy. It doesn't make sense to be rushing towards
commercial release of GE in clean green New Zealand," said
Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A GE Free rally was held on 1 September last year, when
thousands of people marched up Queen St in opposition to the
decision by the Royal Commission on Genetic Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Even more evidence has become available since the Royal
Commission, confirming that GE farming is a dead-end road both
practically and economically," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We say a truly precautionary approach to GE is to keep it in
the lab and use it for ethical medical applications, such as the
production of insulin for diabetics".&lt;/p&gt;

	A series of recent cases signal the rise of climate change litigation around the world. 

Most of the cases have cropped up in the United States, due to perceived inaction by national political authorities over issues of global warming. A recent article in The New Jersey Law Journal says more than a dozen lawsuits involving global warming issues have been brought in the US state and federal courts, and more are anticipated. ("Global warming litigation brought thus far has demonstrated at least four pathways to potential legal recourse against public and private defendants"

	Anyone who has struggled to stay upright in a strong Wellington or Taranaki gale is aware of the intrinsic power of the wind.
Wind energy has been harnessed by people for centuries. From the familiar windmills of Europe to the world’s most famous explorers who mapped the globe by sailing ship. Indeed the first Polynesian and European colonists of New Zealand were brought to these shores by the power of wind.

	Greenpeace today hung a banner from the cliffs of Torbay, Auckland with the message 'Keep the Cup Nuclear Free' to show opposition to the French nuclear industry's involvement in the Cup.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists abseiled down the face of the cliff to hang
the eight by eight meter banner that features a radioactive shadow
in the shape of a death's head behind an 'A' similar to Areva's
logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace painted the radioactive shadow and death's head
behind the 'A' similar to Areva's, so people can clearly see that
behind the facade of being a sailing sponsor is a deadly nuclear
business," said Bunny McDiarmid Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to Areva's sponsorship because their group
of companies are shipping plutonium and nuclear waste through our
region, pollute the marine environment with radioactive waste on a
daily basis and are involved in the development of nuclear weapons
through their majority owner the French Atomic Energy
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is inappropriate for an industry with a history and current
practice of contaminating the environment to try and clean up its
image by associating itself with the clean, green image of
sailing," said McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva was formed in 2001 from a merger between the plutonium
reprocessing company COGEMA, the nuclear reactor construction
company Framatome, and FCI, a maker of electrical connectors. Areva
is 78.96 percent owned by the Commissariat a L'Énergie Atomique
(CEA - the French Atomic Energy Commission) and 5.19 percent owned
by the French government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Areva is here to re-launch itself and make new business using
the French sailing team, the America's Cup and nuclear-free New
Zealand as the venue. Behind the name is an industry with a
terrible environmental record and which is intimately involved in
the nuclear weapons business," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

	In this report we present a design for a global network of high seas marine reserves. Marine reserves are highly protected areas that are off limits to all extractive and destructive uses, including fishing. They are the most powerful tool available for the conservation of ocean wildlife and may also benefit fisheries by promoting recovery and reproduction of exploited species.

	Greenpeace New Zealand initiated a global day of action against incineration by shutting down Waste Resources Limited’s Auckland waste incinerator in the early hours of this morning.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Three activists scaled the chimney and placed a cap on the stack
to prevent the incinerator firing up, before locking themselves to
the chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This incinerator is poisoning people and the environment with
dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals known. Dioxin causes
cancer, birth defects, diabetes and infertility,"(1) said Sue
Connor, Greenpeace Toxics Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Waste incineration is unnecessary because there are alternative
ways to treat waste. Steam sterilisation is used in Auckland and
Wellington".(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Waste Resources incinerator has also been breaching its
resource consent for dioxin pollution for two years, yet they've
been allowed to get away with it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand Government is proposing a regulation which
gives the green light to incineration," said Connor. "This is a
real concern because of the inherit danger of dioxin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Building incinerators will further undermine our clean green
image, which New Zealand's agricultural sector relies on
internationally".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Governments know incinerators release dioxins but, instead of
instigating action plans to tackle the problem at source, they are
still promoting incineration around the world as a solution to the
waste crisis. Under the Stockholm Convention which New Zealand is a
signatory to, they have an obligation to prioritise alternative
approaches to waste management. To continue promoting incineration
while agreeing to eliminate persistent organic pollutants, is sheer
hypocrisy," said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international protests took place as world leaders convened
in Geneva for the first time since agreeing persistent poisons must
be eliminated under the Stockholm Convention. However, they are
still promoting industries that release them into the environment.
The Treaty identifies all waste incinerators as a primary source of
PCBs, furans and cancer causing dioxin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand joined 126 community groups and
environmental organisations spanning 54 countries today (3), to
call on governments and industry to stop burning waste and to start
recycling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The chemicals released from incinerators cause a variety of
health problems; immune and reproductive system defects,
spontaneous abortions, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hormone
disruption and cancers. In May 2001, Greenpeace published
'Incineration and Human Health', a comprehensive review of all
available scientific data on the impacts of incineration on human
health and the effects of specific chemicals discharged from
incinerators. see: www.greenpeace.org.au&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Buenos Aires in Argentina has banned medical waste
incineration; Ireland has closed all medical waste incinerators in
1999; the Phillipines has banned waste incineration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Greenpeace is a member of GAIA - Global Anti-Incinerator
Alliance or Global Alliance - formed when the Stockholm Convention
on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted in May 2001. It

	Fukui, Japan - An armed British nuclear transport ship, the Pacific Pintail, was met by protests from Greenpeace and Japanese anti-nuclear activists as it arrived today at the nuclear reactor port of Takahama, Japan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ship, under guard from Japanese coastguard vessels and
helicopters entered the port area at 9.00am local time. The vessel
is delivering an empty transport container to the reactor site,
where it is due to be loaded with rejected plutonium MOX shipped
originally in 1999. After being loaded into the container or cask
it is planned to ship it back to the UK along one of three secret
routes (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Pintail left the UK on April 26, together with
another armed nuclear freighter, the Pacific Teal. Both vessels
passed through the Caribbean Sea, Panama Canal and across the
Pacific on their voyage to Japan. Caribbean governments condemned
the shipment because of the lack of any notification by the
shipping states, Japan and Britain, as well as the threat of
terrorist attack and accident. In the last week former security
experts, including a former senior UK Government Minister from the
Ministry of Defence, have labeled the shipment as vulnerable to
armed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Ahmed Ali, Vice President of the Fiji Senate, said today:
"The Fiji Government is firmly opposed to all shipments of MOX fuel
through its Economic Exclusion Zone and has always made this clear
to the shipping states."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the 34 Governments of the Organisation of American
States supported and adopted a resolution that called for an
assessment of the security threats posed by nuclear transports
through the Caribbean Sea. Chile called in the British and Japanese
ambassadors on Thursday 6 June to convey its concerns about the
shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Antigua and Barbuda made an impassioned plea
in reference to the planned plutonium MOX shipment from Japan to
the UK and called for an end to nuclear shipments, "Our small
states are fearful that a deliberate act of terror aimed at those
ships may bring an end to our very existence. This is not fanciful
or farfetched fiction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route the shipment will take to return to the UK is still
being kept secret. However Pacific, Cape Horn and Irish Nuclear
Free Seas flotillas have formed to protest the shipments transit
through their regions. There are now 8 boats from New Zealand,
Australia and Vanuatu committed to the Pacific flotilla. Greenpeace
has one boat in the Pacific flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I feel very strongly about the danger that these ships pose to
our oceans, our lives and our futures. That is why I will be out
there in my boat, with my family when they come through," said
Bernard Kuczera, one of the skippers in the Nuclear Free Pacific
Flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Pintail arrived in Takahama, the Teal is expected to
head straight for a Japanese commercial port, probably Kobe. The
Pintail is expected to join it there, where during the next few
days or weeks the ships will take on provisions, as well as
anti-terrorist police from the UK. They are expected to arrive from
the UK just prior to the ships' departure from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This plutonium MOX should never have been shipped to Japan in
the first place. Since BNFL lied to their Japanese customers over
the quality of this MOX, countries should be under no illusion now
that the bland assurances from BNFL and the British and Japanese
Governments that this shipment poses no risk are complacent and
irresponsible," said Bunny McDiarmid, Nuclear Campaigner at
Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In fact, these shipments present a global threat to the
environment through risk of accident or deliberate attack. The fact
that BNFL and the Japanese are trying to make this transport under
the cover of the soccer World Cup only exposes further their
contempt for public safety. This shipment must be abandoned."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to stop the plutonium shipment, Greenpeace is
preparing a legal challenge in the UK. Greenpeace yesterday
announced at a press conference in Takahama that the Arctic
Sunrise, one of the Greenpeace ships, would shortly arrive in Japan
to join those opposed to the MOX shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The eight MOX assemblies containing 255 kilograms of weapons
usable plutonium, as well as uranium, was rejected by Japan after
it was admitted by BNFL that they had deliberately falsified vital
quality control data for the fuel. The resultant scandal in Japan
led to the suspension of plans to load commercial MOX for the first
time in Japanese reactors. In 2001, encouraged by the BNFL scandal
citizens in the village of Kashiwazaki-kariwa voted to block
loading of a batch of French/Belgian MOX fuel delivered also in
1999. In total Japan has shipped over 2,300 kilograms of direct use
weapons plutonium from Europe in the last 17 years. Not one gram
has been loaded into a nuclear reactor and remains stockpiled at
nuclear facilities throughout Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

	Political posturing is further degrading the quality of debate on genetic engineering said Greenpeace today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Prime Minister's reported comments at the Agricultural
Field Days regarding GE were misleading and scientifically
ignorant," said Annette Cotter, GE Campaigner for Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To imply that opposition to GE in food and the environment is
anti science is like saying that opposition to nuclear weapons or
energy is anti-science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The assumption that agriculture can only advance through the
use of genetic engineering reduces science to one poorly understood
discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The canvas on which science and agriculture meet is vast.
Genetic engineering is only a small potential part of that canvas
and one that has proven very problematic environmentally and is
losing market share around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Prime Minister's comments are not based on good science, or
economic insight, rather they are political gainsaying. However,
the Labour Party has underestimated the level of concern about GE
that exists in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Supporters of political parties across the spectrum are opposed
to GE in their food and the environment. The Prime Minister is
wrong to treat GE as an issue for people of one political
affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is time that the issue of GE was addressed, and people's
concerns acknowledged. For too long, it has been 'business as
usual' with field trials and GE food allowed in NZ. If all
political parties want to be truly representative of the
population, calling for a GE free NZ is the only position to
take."&lt;/p&gt;

	Bali, Indonesia: A Greenpeace report: the Bhopal Principles on Corporate Accountability and Liability, urges governments to commit to an international agreement on corporate accountability and liability to stem the tide of corporate environmental abuses, was released at the Earth Summit Bali preparatory meeting today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Governments have allowed big business to wreak havoc on people
and the environment. You only have to look at the Bhopal chemical
disaster eighteen years ago in India: Nothing has been done by the
corporation responsible to provide justice, rehabilitation and
compensation to the victims of the disaster, or clean-up of the
heavily contaminated site," said Annette Cotter of Greenpeace New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toxic affected communities in New Zealand continue to struggle
for recognition of health problems: from plants that manufactured
dioxin contaminated chemicals to sawmills that exposed workers to
dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Right now the Government is investigating the health problems
claimed by residents who lived around the Dow Agrosciences plant
(formerly Ivon Watkins Dow) in New Plymouth," said Sue Connor,
Greenpeace Toxics Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government should use the guiding principles of this report
to put a lid on corporate polluters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is asking governments to take up the Bhopal
Principles on Corporate Accountability and Liability, a
comprehensive set of principles to ensure that corporations protect
human rights, food sovereignty and promote clean and sustainable
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By turning a blind eye to corporate responsibility at the Earth
Summit, governments are surrendering peoples' welfare to the mercy
of corporate criminals," said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report principles are a direct reference to the Bhopal
disaster in 1984, the world's worst chemical disaster which
destroyed the lives of thousands of people who were exposed to
lethal gases which leaked out of a Union Carbide chemical
plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ten Principles on Corporate Accountability include corporate
liability for damages arising from their activities, as well as for
damage to areas beyond national jurisdictions including the global
commons; the protection of human rights; the provision of public
participation and the right to know; protection of food
sovereignty; the implementation of the Precautionary Principle;
adherence to the highest standards for protecting human health and
the environment; avoiding excessive corporate influence over
governance; and promoting clean and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 3, 1984, the world witnessed the worst chemical
disaster ever when a gas leak in the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal,
India killed at least 8,000 workers and residents in the first
three days after the disaster and caused permanent and debilitating
injuries to more than 150,000 people. Union Carbide, by and large,
has managed to escape its obligations and liabilities for this
disaster by paying a pittance ($USD 470 million) to settle all
claims arising from the tragedy, and subsequently deflecting
responsibility for the disaster to the Indian government. Recently,
Union Carbide merged with Dow Chemicals, resulting in the creation
of the world's biggest chemical company. Dow, so far has shown no
sign of taking responsibility over the Bhopal legacy. Justice
remains more elusive than ever for the victims of this
disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ten Principles on Corporate Accountability include corporate
liability for damages arising from their activities, as well as for
damage to areas beyond national jurisdictions including the global
commons; the protection of human rights; the provision of public
participation and the right to know; protection of food
sovereignty; the implementation of the Precautionary Principle;
adherence to the highest standards for protecting human health and
the environment; avoiding excessive corporate influence over
governance; and promoting clean and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

	Proposed management plans for whaling by Japan and Sweden were rejected by the IWC today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Japan's version of the Revised Management Scheme (RMS) that
included the abolition of the moratorium on commercial whaling and
abolition of the Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuaries
was refused, showing Japan's vote buying policy has not been
successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This outrageous proposal would at a stroke have abolished all
those hard won victories by conservation minded countries and
environmental groups at the IWC victories fought on behalf of the
world's remaining whales," says Sarah Duthie Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative proposal sponsored by Sweden, the Netherlands,
Ireland, Oman, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Finland also
failed to gain the three-quarters majority required under IWC rules
to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Management plans have never worked in the past and we've got no
reason to believe they would work now," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given the uncertainty surrounding the whale populations and the
myriad environmental hazards they face, like toxic pollution and
climate change, Greenpeace believes only an outright ban on
commercial whaling can give whales a chance to recover."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Commercial whaling has no place in the 21st century," says
Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

	Today Antigua and Barbuda, Mongolia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, Guinea, Gabon, Benin, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Grenada and Panama voted with Japan at the IWC to deny the Inuit people of Alaska and the Chukotka people of Russia their aboriginal subsistence whaling quota.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Never before in the history of the IWC has an aboriginal whaling
quota been denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the most blatant example we have yet seen of the
Japanese Government's vote buying manipulating the IWC," says Sarah
Duthie, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Aboriginal peoples are being held hostage so the Government of
Japan can further its push to resume commercial whaling," says
Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aboriginal subsistence whaling is allowed by the IWC in order to
meet their basic nutritional needs. The Government of Japan is
likening aboriginal subsistence needs to whaling carried out by
Japanese coastal communities for commercial profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a cynical move by the Government of Japan to hold the
IWC to ransom in order to try and get a coastal whaling quota of 50
minke whales, that it had asked for and was refused earlier this
week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The IWC rightly sees Japan's request for coastal whaling quota
as pure commercial whaling and has denied its request for 14 years
running."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries spoke of this result as appalling and that it was
undermining the democratic process of the IWC meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian delegate highlighted the hypocrisy, saying that
countries, like Japan, which complain of double standards had
actually applied triple standards. He suggested that new member
Mongolia may have been "misorientated" in its voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vote on whether to grant the Inuit and Chukotka people their
aboriginal whaling quota was defeated by a vote of 30 in favour, 14
against, with China abstaining. The vote failed to achieve the
necessary three quarters majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commissioners have now adjourned to a private meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today delivered GE Milk? bottles to the Environmental Risk Management Authority(ERMA) to draw a question mark over the direction of GE research on the first day of hearings into an application for creating genetically engineered cows.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A banner reading 'Next Step: GE Milk?' spelt out with 300
hundred bottles with GE Milk? labels, was laid outside the hearing
venue. Labelled bottles were handed to ERMA members as they entered
the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This application opens the farm gate to GE cows and GE milk for
human consumption. People don't want to drink GE milk from cows
with human genes. Ag Research is heading in the wrong direction
with their human-gene-cows research," said Steve Abel Greenpeace GE
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How healthy are the medicines from infirm and arthritic animals
like Dolly the sheep going to be? ERMA themselves have evaluated
many uncertainties and substantial gaps in knowledge of the
potential risks of horizontal gene transfer in GE animals. New
human illnesses could also occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This application would allow a wide range of genetic
manipulations of cows without assessing the specific dangers of
each experiment. It is like issuing a licence for a driver to get
into any vehicle they choose, rather than warranting each
particular car on its roadworthiness," said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application by Ag Research is for the insertion of human,
mice, goat and other animal genes into cows, for the generation of
therapeutic proteins. Yet no "therapeutic proteins" generated by GE
animals have been approved for use by the USA Food and Drug
Administration because of side effects found in clinical
trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ag Research should be investing in sustainable technologies for
which there are established markets - like organics. GE medical
research should work on what can be created safely and ethically in
the lab," concluded Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and The Body Shop joined forces today to launch an international campaign in the lead up to the Johannesburg Earth Summit, calling on world leaders to increase support for renewable energy to the developing world.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We have an opportunity at the 2002 Earth Summit to set the
developing world on a clean energy pathway. The alternative, of
massive carbon dioxide emissions from dirty fossil fuels would be a
disaster for the world's climate," said Robbie Kelman, Greenpeace
Climate Campaigner,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to believe that in the 21st century, one third of
the planet's population is living without access to basic energy
services. Access to basic, clean energy is essential to alleviate
poverty and provides major social and health benefits," said
Maureen Soanes, Spokesperson for The Body Shop New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint campaign calls on world leaders at the 2002 Earth
Summit to recognise the serious implications of climate change and
commit to providing renewable energy to the two billion people whom
have no access to basic energy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch coincides with the final Preparatory meeting for the
Earth Summit currently being held in Bali. Over half a million
signatures have already been collected in the world-wide campaign
ranging over 32 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are being asked to join the campaign and sign
petitions in The Body Shop's 17 stores across New Zealand for the
next seven weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

	Canberra, Australia: In a peaceful protest today, three Greenpeace climbers, including New Zealander Michael Simpson, scaled the flagpole at Parliament House in Canberra, urging the Australian Government to ratify Kyoto now.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;From the flagpole, Greenpeace Climate Campaigner and expert
climber Catherine Fitzpatrick, said: "Greenpeace has taken this
action today because the Howard Government is failing to address
the root causes of climate change. The evidence that burning fossil
fuels is already disrupting our climate is mounting every day and
John Howard is asleep below us. Greenpeace is here today to wake
him up to his responsibilities to the people of Australia and the
world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"John Howard will go down in history as the man who failed to
act at a critical moment," said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Dr
Frances MacGuire, also present at the protest. "Economists,
scientists and the Australian people themselves all want action on
climate change and the first step in this process is to join Europe
and Japan in ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Last week, the Howard Government confirmed that it would not
ratify the Kyoto Protocol, as it believes it is not in the national
interest to do so;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• To date 76 countries, including Japan and the members of the
European Union, have ratified Kyoto. If Russia and Poland ratify,
as both have pledged to do by the end of this year, the Protocol
will become law;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Only countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol can
participate in the treaty's mechanisms, such as emissions trading,
which will provide economic incentives for companies that reduce
their emissions. If the Government refuses to ratify the Protocol,
Australian companies will be locked out of the global emission
reduction market;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Opinion polling done for Greenpeace over the past fifteen
months shows that 71% of the Australian public believe that
ratifying the Kyoto Protocol would be in the national interest and
80% believe that the Australian Government should ratify, without
the USA if necessary;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• In recent weeks, scientists around the world have linked the
El Nino drought in Australia, the Asian Brown Cloud, the spread of
West Nile virus in North America and the devastating floods across
Europe and Asia to emissions from burning fossil fuels. These will
be major issues at the Earth Summit, where Australia's actions will
be under intense international scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mr Howard, with the release last week of Australia's greenhouse
gas inventory, your excuses for not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol
have dried up just like Australia's farming land," added Ms
Fitzpatrick. "The Australian people want leadership, Mr Howard.
It's time for action."&lt;/p&gt;

	The second incident of GE corn grown in New Zealand would not have been prevented under the new Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) seed testing regime, Greenpeace stated today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;MAF will not test every shipment under its new regime. Shipments
that have been tested overseas will not be tested in New Zealand
before being allowed in. The seed in this case tested negative for
GE in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This reportedly contaminated corn would still have got in even
if MAF's new regime had been in place at the time," said Steve
Abel, GE campaigner today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we are struggling to keep GE seed out of the country, how
can we expect to manage GE field trials and commercial release? New
Zealand must halt all field trials, maintain the moratorium, and
test every seed import to protect our environment and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand must also stop importing seed from the USA. This is
the second incident of GE corn contamination from the USA, after
the first incident in 2000 was revealed in Nicky Hager's book,
Seeds of Distrust. New Zealand has no option but to seek a clean
seed source, and the USA is clearly not it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This incident raises another questions about GE. Who is liable
if neighbouring farms have been contaminated?" said Abel.&lt;/p&gt;

	The democratic process took a pummeling again today at the IWC when the aboriginal peoples of the Inuit and Chukotka were denied their quota for a second time.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Japan now has the United States over a barrel, as the US is
obliged by its treaty obligations with the Inuit to grant them
their whaling quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet their treaty requirements the US will now have to
contravene the IWC decision, setting a precedent that Japan and its
alternate delegate Masayuki Komatsu will find very useful in
pursuing their target of another 25 minke whales for their coastal
whalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Subsistence whaling is very different to the Fisheries Agency
of Japan's request for 25 minke whales for coastal whaling," says
Sarah Duthie, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Coastal whaling is for profit, not to simply survive. Coastal
whaling is commercial whaling, not subsistence whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Subsistence whaling means people have nothing else to eat. They
will starve if they don't get their quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the most acrimonious IWC meeting Greenpeace has
attended in the past 20 years," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Japan and Komatsu's obstructive tactics were
made clear by their cynical manipulation of the aboriginal
subsistence quota and by their manipulation of the countries they
have bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Vote buying by the Japanese Government is making a mockery of
the democratic process at the IWC. The process should be decided by
one country, one vote," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Instead, Japan wields 15 votes, even though these bought
countries continue to embarrass themselves by insisting they are
not bought."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St Lucia, Dominica, St Kitts and
Nevis, Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Panama continued to vote in
line with Japan. Morocco uses abstentions to appear
independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year St Vincents and the Grenadines broke rank for the
first time in two important votes - the sanctuaries vote and the
vote on the Revised Management System (RMS), following a commitment
by their Prime Minister to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We hope this sets a new path for St Vincents and the Grenadines
that other countries in the region will follow," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On all the key votes the four new countries Gabon, Benin, Palau
and Mongolia voted with Japan as predicted. In particular,
Mongolia's voting record is identical to that of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite this vote buying strategy, the Fisheries Agency
of Japan has failed to secure any gains that would have led to a
resumption of commercial whaling. But the Government of Japan will
continue to carry out some commercial whaling under the dishonest
title of "scientific research".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals by the Government of Japan for secret ballots, which
would have provided cover for vote buying and viewed by many as
undemocratic, also failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is obviously disappointed that the proposals for a
South Pacific Whale Sanctuary and a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary
failed. Given that these proposals had the support of the countries
within the sanctuary, it is extremely disturbing that the
Governments of Japan, Norway, Antigua and Barbuda, Palau and many
others see fit to deny these countries their wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the countries that proposed both these sanctuaries will
continue to push forward in the hope that the wishes of both
regions will eventually be respected," says Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, today one of the countries of the South Pacific, Samoa,
has declared its EEZ a Whale Sanctuary. &lt;/p&gt;

	The European Union will today ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change in New York. Greenpeace applauded the EU’s decision to show leadership on climate change and New Zealand’s decision not to forfeit its responsibilities as its neighbour Australia is doing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This decision brings the Protocol's entry into force much
closer," said Robbie Kelman, Greenpeace Climate Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's decision to ratify is in line with other
progressive governments. Thankfully New Zealand has rejected Bush,
his oil industry mates and Australia who have all tried to wreck
international efforts to deal with this issue," said Kelman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol agreed in 1997 came out of the 1st Earth
Summit in Rio. Ten years after the 1992 summit heads of government
are now gathering in Bali for the final preparatory meeting before
the 2002 Johannesburg Earth Summit in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today's EU ratification, the first condition for entry into
force - of 55 Parties ratifying - has been largely met . It also
means a dramatic jump in the percentage of industrialised country
emissions now covered under the Protocol from 2.7% to around 26.7%
- nearly half the required amount of 55%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rejection of the Protocol by the USA, which accounts
for 36.1% of the 1990 CO2 emissions of the industrialised
countries, the principle route to entry into force requires now
Russia, Japan, as well as Poland or most of a group made up of
Central and East European countries and Switzerland to ratify the
Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the possible ratification by Japan next week, the key
question is Russia," said Kelman. "President Putin made a clear
commitment at this week's Russia- EU summit that Russia will
definitely ratify the Protocol, but no dates have been named."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary threshold is also defined in Article 25 of the
Kyoto Protocol. There are two basic conditions for the entry into
force of the Kyoto Protocol. The first one is that at least 55
Parties to the Convention have ratified. However, the key barrier
to the Protocol entering into force is not the number of
ratifications but ensuring that the industrialised countries (Annex
I Parties) that ratify are sufficiently large global warming
polluters to exceed 55 per cent of the 1990 CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today taking into account the 15 EU Member States and the
EC, 70 Parties have already ratified the Kyoto Protocol from which
the following Annex I Parties : Czech Republic, Romania, Norway
representing respectively 1.2%, 1.2% and 0.3% of the total 1990 CO2
Annex I parties. The EU has a 24.2% share of the 1990 Annex I CO2
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Article 25 of the Kyoto Protocol stipulates a period of
ninety days between the deposit of the legal instrument of
ratification which fulfils the necessary threshold and the date of
entry into force. &lt;/p&gt;

	The Green Party stance on legislation allowing the GE moratorium to expire automatically in October next year is a sensible position given international caution on GE organisms.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A secret EU study (1) leaked to Greenpeace states that all
farmers would face high additional, in some cases unsustainable
costs of production if genetically engineered (GE) crops were
commercially grown in a large scale in Europe. The study predicts
that the situation would become particularly critical for organic
farming of oilseed rape as well as for intensive production of
conventional maize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This report sounds alarm bells for every farmer, and has
considerable ramifications for New Zealand. It confirms that GE
will contaminate both conventional and organic crops if allowed,
and will increase costs of farming. Meanwhile farmers will face
uncertain markets for their produce because markets are demanding
GE free," said Annette Cotter GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"More and more international evidence is pointing to the folly
of growing GE crops. The Government is taking an unacceptable risk
with both our environment and our markets, by allowing field trials
now, and commercial crops next year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Green's refusal to support the bill allowing commercial
releases of GE next year shows a cautious and sensible approach to
an unpredictable technology which will undermine our ability to
farm in a sustainable manner."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main findings of the report were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercialisationof GE canola and maize and to a lesser extent
potatoes will increase costs of farming for conventional and
organic farmers from between 10 and 41 per cent of farm prices for
oilseed rape and between one and nine percent for maize and
potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coexistence of GE farming and organic farming would be
impossible in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seedand crop purity from GE at a detection level of 0.1 percent
would be virtually impossible in most cases, i.e. all products and
seeds of oilseed rape and maize would be contaminated with GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU Commission ordered the study on the co-existence of GE
and non-GE crops in May 2000 from the Institute for Prospective
Technological Studies, of the EU Joint Research Centre. The study
was delivered to the EU Commission in January 2002 with the
recommendation that it not be made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) In a letter to the Comission accompanying the study, the
Director General of the EU Joint Research Centre, Barry McSweeney,
suggests that "(…) given the sensitivity of the issue, I would
suggest that the report be kept for internal use within the
Commission only."&lt;/p&gt;

	A decision in favour of Greenpeace by the French High Court has dealt a blow to Areva's attempt to use the law to censor criticism of the company.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The French judge ruled against Areva's claim that a logo on the
Greenpeace New Zealand and France websites broke French commercial
trademark law. The judge upheld Greenpeace's right to freedom of
expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand and Greenpeace France welcomes the French
court's decision as a victory for the right to freely express
opposition to Areva's nuclear reprocessing and transports impact on
the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva brought proceedings against Greenpeace France, Greenpeace
New Zealand and a French internet company, claiming that their
trademark had been devalue by the use of a radioactive shadow and
death's head behind an "A" similar to Areva's. They were claiming
NZ$193,000 (approx) in fines plus legal expenses and wanted the
internet company to take out an injunction against Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Areva's bid to stop Greenpeace using the logo merely showed how
desperate Areva is to prevent any adverse criticism of their
activities," said Bunny McDiarmid, spokesperson for the Greenpeace
nuclear campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge has confirmed the right for public campaigning groups
to use creative tools on the internet to expose the real nature of
polluting companies, Greenpeace said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says the use of a grey radioactive shadow and the
deaths head behind the A similar to Areva was to highlight what
they believe the company really stands for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to show that behind the nice name is a deadly
industry," McDiarmid said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva is a nuclear company that develops nuclear weapons through
their majority owner the French Atomic Energy Commission. Their
reprocessing company, Cogema discharges millions of liters of
radioactive waste into the sea off France every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva is sponsoring the French entry, Defy Areva, in the
America's Cup in New Zealand starting in October. They are due to
arrive in New Zealand, late August. Both Greenpeace France and
Greenpeace New Zealand have used their websites to give the public
access to information on the company's activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People have a right to know what Areva does. In New Zealand
they are trying to present themselves as a clean benign power
company and this could not be further from the truth," McDiarmid
said.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Prime Minister of Fiji Mr. Laisenia Qarase, called on the Heads of Government at the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) meeting in Fiji today to join the Pacific in its outrage and opposition to the shipments of plutonium MOX waste travelling through the region.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ACP meeting, attended by delegations representing 78
countries, is being held in Nadi, Fiji and the Prime Minister made
the statement during the opening session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said in his opening speech, "As I speak a
ship carrying plutonium is heading for our waters, having traversed
other parts of the region. We will be asking you to join with us in
expressing our outrage and opposition to those who are so willing
to put the Pacific and our peoples at risk." The response from the
meeting was applause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angenette Heffernan of Greenpeace has welcomed the statement by
the Prime Minister of Fiji, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We commend the Prime Minister for taking a leadership role on
this issue and are confident that the ACP will support his
statement. The Prime Minister's statement is a strong indication
that this will be a key issue for the Pacific Heads of Government
when they meet at their annual meeting next month".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Australia, New Zealand and Ireland have been notified about the
route and the time of the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal's
transit, but BNFL have failed to consult with the Pacific Nations
and are now trying to silence any information being released to the
Pacific countries about the whereabouts of the ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is tantamount to racism. They are showing blatant
discrimination towards these islands by showing no concern for the
opinions, wishes and safety of the Pacific," said Ms Heffernan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ships, Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal, carrying 255kgs
of weapons-usable material have in the last week breached the
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of the Federated States of
Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. They
are now heading towards the EEZ of New Caledonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each nation has the right to protect the marine environment
within its EEZ under the Law of the Sea Convention. In the light of
the dangers to the marine environment and populations of coastal
states, the failure of the shipping states to take basic steps such
as consulting with en route states about the route and safety
arrangements, the BNFL ships have no rights to 'innocent passage'
through territorial waters and can be asked to stay out of en route
countries' EEZs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom, which is the flag State of the vessels, has
previously given New Zealand an assurance it will not pass through
New Zealand's EEZ. The passage through the EEZs of other Pacific
States such as FSM, despite their specific request to stay out, is
discriminatory and insulting to those smaller States, as well as
dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today erected a mock enforcement notice at the Auckland International Airport Ltd incinerator for illegally breaking its operating permits for over two years. South Auckland community groups and Greenpeace delivered a letter to the incinerator manager demanding a phase out of the incinerator and a move to clean technology.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Auckland Regional Council (ARC) is responsible for issuing
permits and for enforcing them when operators fail to meet
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ARC has sat on its hands and allowed the communities of
South Auckland to be poisoned by deadly dioxins and other toxic
chemicals. Greenpeace is taking the action today that the ARC has
failed to do," said Sue Connor, Toxics Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The South Auckland community does not want this incinerator. It
is produces toxic pollution including cancer-causing dioxin, heavy
metals and furans that are polluting the people and the environment
of South Auckland."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mangere People's Centre, Waste Wise Trust, Pukaki Worm Farm
and Greenpeace delivered a letter to the operator of the
incinerator (Waste Resources Ltd) today. The letter demands a
commitment to close down the incinerator and replace it with clean
technology such as the steam sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nga Manga, the Mangere community group network of South Auckland
groups, unanimously passed a resolution opposing the incinerator on
25 July, 2002:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That this meeting of Nga Manga calls on the Manukau City
Council and the ARC to urgently replace the Auckland International
Airport incinerator with a cleaner process."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is outrageous that this incinerator can continue to operate.
It is not wanted by local communities and it is not needed. There
are proven clean alternatives to incineration, such as steam
sterilisation used by Wellington airport. The ARC must enforce it's
own regulations and protect the people and environment of South
Auckland," said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcement notice billboard reads: "This incinerator is
illegally exceeding its dioxin emissions under Auckland Regional
Council Permit # 9007. This incinerator must be shut down and
converted to safe technology. By order of Greenpeace."&lt;/p&gt;

	The Nuclear Free Flotilla successfully delivered its message of protest to the two armed UK nuclear freighters this morning, despite the freighters best efforts to sneak through the flotilla's line in the dead of night.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Two activists from the flotilla were dropped into the water at
dawn, after catching up with the two plutonium ships in an
inflatable boat. The two swimmers, Ian Cohen, the upper house
member of the New South Wales Parliament and Stuart Lennox of
Tasmania, held up a banner, which read "Nuclear Free Pacific" as
the two ships passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As an elected member of the New South Wales Parliament,
representing many Australians who have expressed strong
anti-nuclear sentiment, I wanted to make sure that there was no
doubt in these shippers minds that they are not welcome in this
region," said Ian Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flotilla boats also radioed their message of protest to the
ships after they picked them up on the radar around midnight and
moved to intercept them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We may be ten boats but our strength is that we carry the
wishes and demands of many thousands of people. It is pretty clear
from the plutonium shippers avoidance tactics overnight that they
are scared to face public opinion," said New Zealand resident, Henk
Haazen from the Nuclear Free Flotilla. "However they will not be
able to avoid the growing public and government pressure building
against them from Japan all the way to the Irish Sea, to stop this
insane business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar protest was carried out last year when a shipment of
plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) went through the Tasman en route from
France to Japan. The Nuclear Free Seas Flotilla movement has grown
to include a flotilla in the Cape Horn region and one in Ireland
that is preparing to protest the arrival of the ships in the Irish
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal are carrying a cargo of
faulty MOX, including 255 kgs of weapons-usable plutonium, that
left Japan for the UK on Thursday, July 4th. The shipment of faulty
MOX is being returned to the UK because its producers, the
technically bankrupt government-owned British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL),
falsified critical safety data on the fuel and the Japanese refused
to use it. As a result of the scandal and due to a loss of
confidence by the Japanese communities in the MOX industry, none of
the MOX that has been shipped to Japan in the last four years has
been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The proliferation and environmental risks that this industry
takes in producing plutonium are enormous. To then ship it
increases the risks many times, and passes these risks to every
coastal nation en route," said Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace Nuclear
Campaigner. "It is clear from the strength of government and public
opposition to this current shipment that it is no longer a question
of 'if' these shipments are stopped but when."&lt;/p&gt;

	A new study on genetically engineered food rings alarm bells for human health, said Greenpeace today. The study questions approval systems for GE food, and validates concerns that GE food is untested and unsafe.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This study shows the potential for antibiotic resistance to
increase as a result of eating GE food. The GE industry have denied
this for years while they rush GE food into commercialisation,"
said Annette Cotter, Genetic Engineering Campaigner for
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Astoundingly, this is the first known trial of GE foods on
human volunteers, yet GE food has been approved by our Food Safety
Authority for some years. The new study questions the validity of
the 'approve first, test later' approach to allowing GE in our
food."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by Newcastle University for the UK Food Standards Agency
revealed genetically engineered (GE) genes are showing up in human
stomach bacteria. The researchers fed seven volunteers, who have
had their lower intestines removed, a hamburger with GE soya and a
milkshake. The stools tested from the volunteers' colostomy bags
showed that a "relatively large portion of the genetically
engineered DNA survived the passage through the small bowel."11
Source: John Vidal, Wednesday July 17, 2002, The Guardian,
http://www.guardian.co.uk/gmdebate/Story/0,2763,756666,00.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study went further to see if this genetically engineered DNA
could be transferred via bacteria in the large intestine. In
laboratory simulated gastrointestinal tracts, three of the seven
samples revealed human gut bacteria had taken on the
herbicide-resistant gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Corngate has raised serious questions about the GE status of
corn on New Zealanders' plates over the past two years. Given these
questions and the fact that New Zealand's Food Safety Authority has
given the green light to many GE foods, we should be very concerned
about the impacts of GE food on human health," Cotter
concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	Svalbard, Arctic Circle: New Zealand’s Franz Josef glacier is one of six glaciers worldwide highlighted as showing signs of retreat from climate change, Greenpeace revealed today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The images of archival and contemporary photographs showing
glacial retreat in USA, Peru, Nepal, Austria, Uganda, New Zealand
and Svalbard (Norway) in the Arctic were released aboard the
Rainbow Warrior undertaking a research tour focusing on Arctic
glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Franz Josef is showing signs of being a casualty of climate
change. Warmer temperatures and altered snow and rain patterns from
climate change are resulting in the retreat of glaciers the world
over," said Robbie Kelman, Greenpeace New Zealand climate
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Increased temperatures brought about by greenhouse polluting
gases like methane and the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil and
gas, are destroying glaciers. Unless we break our addiction to
fossil fuels, we risk the wholesale destruction of glaciers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, the Franz Josef glacier, has retreated
approximately one and half kilometres since records were kept.
Maori call the Franz Josef, Ka Roimato O Hine Hukatere or Frozen
Tears of the Ice Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior conducted the documentation journey to the
Arctic glaciers of Svalbard with Professor Jon Ove Hagen from the
University of Oslo, and was assisted in its documentation by the
Norwegian Polar Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The glacier retreats we have seen in Kongsfjorden are due to
climatic changes over the last century," said Professor Ove
Hagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If global warming continues as the climate models predict, we
can expect an accelerated retreat of these glaciers in the future,
as we have already seen happening in Alaska and other places across
the rest of the world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Climate change is a global problem - not only do we risk losing
the world's glaciers but we face many other impacts such as
increased floods, droughts and storms, loss of coral reefs,
sea-level rise and rapid spread of insect-borne diseases," said
Kelman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is campaigning at the Johannesburg Earth Summit for
governments to make a commitment to provide clean and affordable
renewable energy to the two billion people around the world who
currently live without electricity, and is demanding governments
ensure that 10% of all electricity supply by 2010 is provided from

	The Prime Minister of New Zealand was one of a large crowd that gathered in support in Auckland to farewell the New Zealand arm of the Pacific flotilla which plans to gather next week in the northern Tasman Sea and wait for two ships carrying reject plutonium en route from Japan to England.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, an official speaker at
the flotilla departure, gave strong words of support and said the
Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea and New Zealand should remain nuclear
free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister also said the New Zealand Government had
officially contacted the British and Japanese governments stating
strong objection to the transportation of nuclear materials through
the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment is totally unnecessary and puts us all at risk,"
said Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People at the flotilla departure were treated to live music from
Polynesian and Latin bands and to an exhibition that showed the
many faces of the flotilla worldwide. The public was encouraged to
tie a ribbon in support of the Nuclear Free Seas flotillas. The
exhibition will run until 14 July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Flotilla is also made up of yachts from Vanuatu and
Australia which have already departed for the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two armed UK freighters the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal
departed Japan July four and are expected to reach the Tasman
within two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flotillas have formed in the South America and Ireland to
protest these shipments demonstrating the growing concern that the
public has over the transportation of plutonium, said
McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

	The cover-up exposed today in Seeds of Distrust is an outrage. This illegal, dishonest and unacceptable series of events resulted in the contamination of our sweetcorn and environment, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A committee of the Environmental Risk Management Authority
(ERMA), the Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF), big
business and the Government conspired to keep crucial information
from the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government is guilty of lying to the public about GE
contaminated sweetcorn, and refusing to rectify the situation by
removing the crop. For all their cautious words, they have actively
allowed a release of GE corn into our environment. This shows the
collusion of big business and the Labour Government and it's pro-GE
agenda," said Annette Cotter, Genetic Engineering campaigner
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government knowingly allowed GE contaminated seeds to be
planted here during it's own Royal Commission of Inquiry into
Genetic Engineering. The Government has misled the Royal
Commission. If they'd been honest to the Inquiry, the Report may
have been very different. This revelation makes a mockery of that
whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To add insult to injury, ERMA assisted the Government in the
cover-up by withholding critical information from the public during
the Royal Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"ERMA is a body that is touted as being the most stringent in
the world. Now they've allowed GE to be grown illegally. ERMA
clearly cannot be trusted."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeds of Distrust raises more serious questions about our
biosecurity. "What else has been contaminated? Is this season's
corn contaminated with GE?" said Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Urgent action is needed to address this crisis. The Government
must act immediately to ensure New Zealand's biosecurity has a
regime of zero tolerance to GE contamination. The crop sites must
be immediately decontaminated. Every seed shipment that comes into
the country must be tested for GE contamination," said Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The revelation of GE contamination revealed today is not a
justification for saying it's all too late and that New Zealand
should accept GE. The Government must take every possible action to
eradicate this contamination and ensure a GE Free future," Cotter
concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	The grounding of the British destroyer HMS Nottingham, which is rumoured to be in the Tasman to escort the plutonium ships, only highlights how irresponsible and dangerous this whole transport is, Greenpeace said today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Shipments of plutonium will be in the Tasman Sea within two
weeks and in the last week bad weather has grounded the HMS
Nottingham and devastated the Federated States of Micronesia," said
Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace Nuclear spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You have to seriously wonder if those who are making the
decision to send these ships through this region in the middle of
winter know what they are doing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts of the route planned for the plutonium shipments are
officially classified as Marine High Risk Areas by Lloyds of
London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The shipment is dangerous enough on its own let alone adding
risk by sending it through the southern seas in winter," said
McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions have also been raised on why the HMS Nottingham is in
this region in the first place. UK Channel 4 News has speculated
that she is there to protect the plutonium shipments from terrorist
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There have been rumours running for the last few months that
the shipment of reject plutonium, carrying 255 kgs of
weapons-usable material would have an additional escort that would
not be part of the public plan," said McDiarmid. "Clearly those
making the shipment recognise what a security risk this shipment
is".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HMS Nottingham ran aground off Lord Howe in the mid- Tasman,
300 miles north east of Sydney yesterday, near where the Pacific
Flotilla will converge. Only last week an oil tanker also grounded
off the coast of Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;

	Gordon Jackman announced that he was stepping down as Chair of Greenpeace at the Board meeting held today in Auckland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He had found himself in a position of conflicting interests as a
result of being asked to assist the Green Party in its negotiations
with the Labour Party following the election result last
weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to set the record straight that I am participating in
the negotiations as a private individual. This role is not tenable
in the role of the Chair and Trustee of Greenpeace New Zealand,"
said Mr Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to protect the integrity of Greenpeace and its ability
to operate independently of any political party," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board acknowledged the huge contribution Gordon had made to
Greenpeace as a Toxics and Forestry campaigner for many years
before he joined the Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In his role as Chair he had done an excellent job pulling all
parts of the organisation together. His departure was accepted with
great regret and he was offered the very best wishes for whatever
role he took up in future," said Margaret Crozier, Executive
Director of Greenpeace New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace said that the decision by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) and Kansai Electric to transport reject plutonium by sea back to England is incredibly irresponsible.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The two armed UK freighters the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal
departed Japan last night and are en-route to England via the
Tasman Sea. "To send highly radioactive materials on a six-week,
18,000 mile journey on the high seas was a stupid idea before 11
September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's context it can only be described as insane," said
Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace Nuclear Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plutonium MOX was originally shipped to Japan in 1999 but
the producers, government owned British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) were
found to have falsified critical safety data and the Japanese
refused to use it. The reject plutonium includes 255 kgs of
weapons-usable plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL has set aside NZ$ 412m to compensate Japan and to cover the
costs of returning the faulty MOX in the hope that they will secure
new contracts with the Japanese. If this happens we can expect up
to 80 more shipments between Japan and Europe. However, the
Japanese plutonium programme is in disarray with opposition in
prefectures where MOX is planned to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of an accident at sea is always there, as seen with the
grounding of an oil tanker off Fiji last week. "The stakes are
raised when you send such a dangerous cargo through some of the
roughest seas on board a vessel carrying 1,100 tonnes of fuel and
live ammunition." In recent days it has been revealed that the
Pacific Pintail and Teal also have a corrosion problem which BNFL
have refused to release details about. The Japanese nuclear
industry which are part owners of the vessels together with the UK
and French Governments only learnt about this problem after news
reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomes the New Zealand Government's commitment to
have Orion's observing the movements of the boats so that they do
not enter New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). A Pacific
flotilla of 12 boats is setting out from NZ, Australia, and Vanuatu
this weekend to protest the passage of the shipment. Seven boats,
reminisce of the Moruroa flotilla, will depart the Viaduct Basin,
Auckland on Sunday lunchtime (July 7) and will meet the five other
boats in the middle of the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

	Brussels - Greenpeace welcomes the European Parliament’s vote for tightening European regulations on labelling and traceabilty of genetically engineered (GE) food and feed, putting European regulations well ahead of New Zealand’s.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;For the first time, GE feed will be labelled in the European
Union. All GE food, including highly processed ingredients such as
sugar, oil, starch, produced from GMOs, will have to be labelled.
The new regulation will set up a thorough traceability system in
order to follow food and food ingredients produced from GMOs across
all stages of food processing until the final product. New Zealand
has no traceability system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand cannot claim to have the toughest GMO labelling
regime in the world. Europe is set to take that prize. The results
from the European Parliament will enable European consumers and
farmers to choose what products to eat and use," GE campaigner
Annette Cotter said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand's labelling of GE food is woefully inadequate and
cannot ensure security for our food, our environment or New
Zealand's clean green image. The EU regulations put ours to
shame."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alistair Polston, president of Federated Farmers claimed last
night on the Holmes Show that New Zealand's labelling laws were the
strongest in the world. The results from Europe shoot holes in this
claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomed especially the following points from the
regime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* All food and feed will have to be labelled, if they come from
GMOs, on the basis of the new traceability system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Zero tolerance for contamination in food and feed from GMOs
that have not been authorised. * If food / feed is contaminated by
authorised GMOs by 0.5% or more, then the product must be labelled
as containing GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* National biosafety agencies will have to be involved in the
risk assessment through the centralised authorisation procedure for
GE food and feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace calls on the New Zealand authorities to apply the
same strict regime. Likewise the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF) must adopt a zero tolerance system for contamination
of GE in food and feed. Anything less is unacceptable," concluded
Cotter. &lt;/p&gt;

	Statements made today by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and supported by the Life Sciences Network and Federated Farmers are incorrect, according to the Seeds of Distrust by Nicky Hager.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Government and ERMA both knew GE corn had been released into
the environment in the 2000-2001 growing season. ERMA failed to
adequately inform the Royal Commission and the public of this
occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marion Hobbs press release today states, "It cannot be claimed
therefore that GM material was released …"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helen Clark stated on Check Point on National Radio this evening
"there was no GM proven in the seeds".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federated Farmers' press release today stated: "There is no
evidence that any GM contamination actually occurred" and the LSN
and FF press statements (coincidentally identical in much of their
text) both said, "The tests were contradictory and as a result
inconclusive …"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbs also states in relation to a press release on the issue:
"I also said at the time that officials would submit a report to
the Royal Commission on this matter."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSN and FF statements also suggest the issue was fully canvassed
by ERMA at the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification. The LSN
states: 'The entire saga was presented to the Royal Commission on
GM'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements are incorrect according to the evidence
contained in Seeds of Distrust and continue to mislead the public
on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in a confidential memo from Dr Oliver Sutherland,
Deputy Chair ERMA to the ERMA Board on 15 January 2001 (contained
as an Appendix, page147 in Seeds of Distrust) states, in relation
to the GM corn release; 'Since we know that the Novartis sweet corn
is contaminated, is it acceptable that it should remain in the
ground?' and '… it is a very substantial number of completely
uncontrolled GM plants now growing in the field.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements are based on a report for ERMA from Donald
Hannah (ERMA) that states, "… with a considerable degree of
confidence it can be concluded the Novartis sweet corn … has less
than 0.5% GM contamination" (page 147)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, by any reasonable standards of providing clear
evidence to a Royal Commission ERMA fed the deceit of the
government on this issue by failing to fully outline the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from Dr Sutherland's memo (cited above) he was fully
aware the corn was contaminated and yet he stated in evidence on
1st March 2001, "the discovery of POSSIBLE contamination in a 5.6
tonne shipment of sweetcorn into New Zealand last year …". (page 59
of ERMA's hearing evidence to the Royal Commission). Dr Sutherland
then proceeded to explain a theoretically possible situation where
GE corn was released and the regulatory difficulties of dealing
with this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Sutherland's evidence goes on to say: "The realisation that
GM plants as inadvertent contaminants …" (page 61). This GE corn
release was not inadvertent. The Government and ERMA both knew by
this time that GE corn was in the ground in considerable numbers
with at least 14,000 plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	Despite GE foods having been approved and released into our food chain without any long term testing, Life Sciences Network is claiming that ‘Approved use of GM is safe’.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"In the same press release, Life Sciences Network then hedge
their bets by saying, 'this doesn't guarantee absolute safety; but
then nothing does…' (1). How safe is safe enough? It sounds like
cigarettes in the 50s, or 2-4-5T in the 70s - called safe and then
proven otherwise," said Annette Cotter, GE campaigner for
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Life Sciences Network's conclusion that all 'approved GE' is
safe is way off the mark. They are blindly putting all their faith
in regulatory processes that have made mistakes before."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the US, GE corn called Starlink was approved for
animal consumption only, in order to avert the risk of human
allergenicity. But once approved for environmental release,
Starlink proved impossible to keep out of the human food chain.
Millions were spent by the GE company Aventis to recall the
corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This corn is not safe for humans, the environment or business
but was approved by the authorities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Pro-GE lobby is sounding more and more desperate in the
face of widespread public resistance to GE. Their latest tactic is
to trot out former environmentalist, and industry apologist Patrick
Moore to try and discredit Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a poor attempt at green washing that no one is
convinced by. Groups are familiar with Mr Moore, whose arguments
did not stand up to scrutiny under cross-examination during the
Royal Commission of Inquiry into Genetic Modification."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick Moore is well known in Canada where he is used by the
forestry industry to justify logging old-growth forests and
appeared during the campaign to halt logging of public land on the
West Coast, South Island to speak in favour of Timberlands West
Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

	Oil giant Esso/Mobil is trying to sue Greenpeace in France over the use of logos on the StopEsso website.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Esso claims that a double dollar sign ($$) on one logo
associates the company with the Nazi SS. Esso has demanded the
withdrawal of all the logos, a penalty of 80,000 Euros a day for
reputational damage and 80,000 Euros per day per logo should
Greenpeace fail to comply. It also demands removal of all use of
the term "StopEsso".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is just ridiculous. Esso knows it can't win a debate about
climate change, and it won't discuss the content of the website.
Instead Esso is trying to gag us with legal threats. We will fight
this in court," said executive director of Greenpeace
International, Gerd Leipold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso claims these logos would cause the public to be repulsed,
turning them away from the Esso brand. It's not the logos but
Esso's actions in trying to stop the Kyoto Protocol that is
damaging its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso is trying to interfere with free speech on the Internet.
The company is simply worsening its already bad reputation even
further with this ill-considered legal action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Esso is a big, rich company. It is simply trying to use its
muscle and money to stop anyone who is critical of its policies,"
said Leipold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso is the world's biggest oil corporation. In 2001 the company
made profits of $US15.5 billion. Greenpeace is an independent
environmental group, funded entirely by individual donations from
supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso is marketed as Exxon and Mobil globally. StopEsso, a
coalition of groups including Greenpeace, is campaigning around the
world to stop Esso from sabotaging international action to address
climate change, such as the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French website www.greenpeace.fr/stopesso/ over which Esso
wants to sue, is one of several StopEsso sites globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hearing date has been set down for Monday July 1, 2002 in
Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three Greenpeace activists were arrested and charged with trespass and unlawfully being upon a building after shutting down the Waste Resources Limited’s Auckland waste incinerator early this morning.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The three activists scaled the chimney and placed a cap on the
stack to prevent the incinerator from firing up, before locking
themselves to the chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will appear in court and are expected to be released later
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined 126 community groups and environmental
organisations spanning 54 countries today, to call on governments
and industry to stop burning waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waste incineration releases dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Waste Resources incinerator has been breaching its resource
consent for dioxin pollution for the last two years. There is no
safe level of dioxin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace wants the Government to ban incineration, and Waste
Resources Limited to change to clean alternative methods of
treating waste.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace and the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York called on countries to support a new resolution by all members of the United Nations to uphold the UN Charter and hold an Emergency Session of the General Assembly (1) to avoid an illegal war on Iraq (2).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Anti-war advocates said all 191 members of the UN General
Assembly should use UN resolution 377, known as 'Uniting for
Peace', to call an emergency session because the Security Council
is split on the issue of how to maintain international peace and
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that the United States and United Kingdom will not
succeed in ramming through a resolution to go to war. Yet it's also
clear that, even without UN backing, those countries intend to wage
a reckless war which would make the world a much more dangerous
place. It's now up to all the world's countries, not just a few of
the powerful, to meet together to avert this march to war." Said,
Steve Sawyer, Head of delegation for Greenpeace at the United
Nations headquarters in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has written to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark,
calling for New Zealand support for this initiative and will be
meeting the New Zealand Ambassador to the UN, Don McKay, tomorrow
in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the permanent members of the Security Council cannot agree on
measures for the maintenance of international peace and security,
the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution enables the General Assembly to
consider the matter immediately. The General Assembly can be
convened within 24 hours to consider and recommend, measures to UN
members. The resolution has been invoked ten times in the past 50
years. (3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Ratner, President of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, stated: "The 'Uniting for Peace' resolution may be the last
hope to avert war. If passed, it will put the U.S. and the U.K. on
notice that a war without Security Council authorization is utterly
illegal and a crime against the peace."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If it wanted the world to be ruled by the cowboy with the
biggest guns, the international community wouldn't have created the
UN in the first place," added Sawyer. "The UN, including the
General Assembly, was created to preserve the rule of law and
promote multilateralism. It's time the UN fully exercises its
mandate and unites as a whole to defend its founding principles and
stop the impending attack on Iraq, which would be the most horrific
example of unilateralism. It must take this last chance for peace,"
he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Resolution 377 (Uniting for Peace) recognises that the
Security Council has primary responsibility for keeping the peace,
but notes that a failure of the Security Council to discharge its
responsibilities "does not deprive the General Assembly of its
rights or relieve it of its responsibilities under the Charter in
regard to the maintenance of international peace and security". The
operative part of Resolution 377 says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolves that if the Security Council, because of lack of
unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the
peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General
Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to
making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective
measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of
aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or
restore international peace and security. If not in session at the
time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session
within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency
special session shall be called if requested by the Security
Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the
Members of the United Nations;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full text of Resolution 377 can be found at
http://nowar.greenpeace.org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) A further reason for the UN to meet in emergency session is
to consider the position of the USA and Britain, which are all
prepared to abandon the fundamental principle of non-aggression
under international law and the UN system. Colin Powell told world
business leaders at Davos in January that the US continues "to
reserve our sovereign right" to unilaterally attack Iraq if it
decides that Iraq is not cooperating with the UN inspectors.
Britain has said it is prepared to ignore "unreasonable vetoes" in
the Security Council. This means the Security Council will not
prevent war in Iraq. Experts on international law from around the
world have stated that an invasion of Iraq without the express
agreement of the Security Council would be illegal, and that there
is no basis in international law for the Security Council to agree
to the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the veto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSR?Russia: 120 vetoes. Only two vetoes since the collapse of
the Soviet Union US: 76 vetoes. Blocked 35 resolutions criticising
Israel. UK: 32 vetoes, 23 times with the US. All solo UK vetoes on
Zimbabwe France: 18 vetoes, 13 with the US and UK China: 5
vetoes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The Uniting for Peace resolution has been used ten times
since 1950. After Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956,
Britain and France attacked and occupied parts of the canal.
Cease-fire resolutions in the Security Council were vetoed by
Britain and France. The United States went to the General Assembly
calling for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of forces. An emergency
session was held under the "Uniting for Peace" resolution, and in
the face of strong resolutions from the General Assembly, it took
less then a week for Britain and France to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniting for Peace was again used by the United States to
pressure the Soviet Unon to cease its intervention in Hungary in
1956, after the Soviet Union had used its vetoto prevent the
passage of an anti-intervention resolution in the Security Council.
Again,an emergency session of the General Assembly was held and the
Soviet Union was ordeed to stop its intervention in Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today expressed concern over the comments made by the Government and a scientist today denying conclusive evidence of GE contamination in the testing of corn imported into New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"There was never any doubt about whether or not the corn was
contaminated. ERMA scientist Donald Hannah concluded that there was
"less than 0.5 percent GM contamination" in the Novartis sweet corn
Lot NC9114".11 Evaluation of Information Received for Novartis
Jubilee Sweetcorn Lot NC9114, Donald Hannah, Manager, Science and
Research, 5th December 2000. He never concluded that the corn was
not contaminated, only that the level of contamination came under
the Government's judiciously selected allowable contaminations
threshold" said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace spokesperson today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To conclude from these results that there was no GE
contamination is like saying that tests show we only have chickens
when results show that we have ninety nine chickens and one
fox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Russell Poulter on National Radio today made a number of
claims regarding the test results of the corn, calling into
question the validity of the positive results for GE
contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dr Poulter says some seemingly contradictory statements. First
he claims that false positives 'occasionally register'. He then
goes on to say that the five positive results obtained in two
separate, independent laboratories do not indicate GE
contamination, but are false positives. That appears to be
contradictory to the law of averages - to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He then says that the testing of the corn in Melbourne showed
negative results. According to a diagram, which Dr Poulter has a
copy of, in 'Seeds of Distrust', the Melbourne lab showed three
positive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ERMA scientist Donald Hannah looked at the positive test results
and determined that lab error resulting in false positives was
unlikely because the labs ran identical tests on 'controls' (seeds
known to be GE free). These registered negative while the Lot
NC9114 seeds registered positive. He also concluded that the
contaminant was likely to be a GE variety Bt 11 (page 55, Seeds of
Distrust).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The arguments being pushed today that question the existence of
GE contaminated corn and claim that test results were false
positives, have no substance. There is no doubt that the
contamination existed. The test results were validated at the time
by ERMA scientists and stand up to scrutiny now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government is using smoke and mirrors to deflect attention
away from the fact that GE contaminated corn was planted, grown and
harvested in New Zealand and the Government sanctioned it," Cotter
concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><isDateMissing>0</isDateMissing><author_name></author_name></item>

	The Spanish police have boarded the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior at port's entrance of the Rota naval base as the ship was blocking the U.S. Navy vessel Cape Horn from delivering arms to the Gulf region in preparation for the war against Iraq.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The crew, activists and the captain were protesting
non-violently as 20 policemen moved in to the ship. A tugboat was
preparing to move the Rainbow Warrior from the exclusion zone,
which was declared by the authorities earlier this week. Before
boarding the ship, the special forces of Spanish police, Guardia
Civil, gave the captain of the Rainbow Warrior a written order to
leave the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace considers that this is a just protest because we are
trying to prevent an illegal war. Greenpeace is acting in order
that the Spanish Government listens to the requests of its citizens
and stops supporting the war against Iraq," said Juan Lopez de
Uralde, director of Greenpeace Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, activists in inflatable boats from the Greenpeace
flagship Rainbow Warrior confronted the U.S. Coast Guard ship
Dallas as it left the Rota naval base in Spain armed with guns,
torpedoes and harpoon missiles. Four activists brandished banners
saying "No War" and chased the Dallas for two miles before being
intercepted by three police boats and a helicopter. There were no
arrests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on all members of the United Nations to
prevent Spain, the U.K. and the U.S. from undermining the UN
Charter by waging an illegal war on Iraq. Greenpeace said all 191
members of the UN General Assembly should use UN resolution 377,
known as 'Uniting for Peace', to call an emergency session because
the Security Council is split on the issue of how to maintain
international peace and security. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has exposed who is pulling the Australian Prime Minister's strings, unveiling a giant John Howard puppet in downtown Wellington today. The puppet is dangling from the outstretched fingers of Gollum (aka G.W. Bush) on the Embassy Theatre to mark Howard's visit to New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"John Howard, in defiance of the will of the Australian people ,
has sent troops to the Middle East in support of what would be an
illegal and unprecedented strike against Iraq. He has shown himself
to be nothing more than a puppet of the US Government," said Robbie
Kelman, Greenpeace No-War Campaign spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Waging a war against Iraq would therefore be illegal under the
United Nations Charter. As such, John Howard's complicity in the
'coalition of the willing' distinguishes him as a war monger, bent
on gaining kudos with the White House war machine," Kelman
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We agree Iraq, and indeed all nations with weapons of mass
destruction need to be disarmed, but preventative military strikes
are not the way to do this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Both Howard and his puppet-master, G.W. Bush, should put their
energy into strengthening collective international arms controls
and conventions, rather than launching into war," Kelman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed a statement from Progressive Enterprises Ltd that will see them becoming the first supermarket chain in New Zealand to go GE free in their own brands.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The policy outlined "the goal of Progressive Enterprises Ltd
that our Signature Range and Basics branded products will not be
sourced from ingredients derived from genetically modified
crops".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People do not want to be part of a GE experiment that could
effect our environment and our health, and Progressive has clearly
acknowledged this. They have ensured that all ingredients will be
from GE free sources. This goes above and beyond the ANZFA
labelling laws that take effect in a few weeks (1) and is another
significant move in the global rejection of genetic engineering."
said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive holds about a quarter of the New Zealand retail
grocery market and operates the Foodtown, Countdown and 3Guys
supermarket banner groups. Progressive is also the franchise
co-ordinator for the FreshChoice and SuperValue banner groups.
(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Progressive have taken the lead and are the first supermarket
chain to commit to a GE free policy for their own brands. Now other
supermarket chains like Woolworths and New World (Foodstuffs) need
to continue the trend and make the same commitment," said Ms
Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week in the United States, a similar commitment was made by
Trader Joe's, the first mainstream supermarket chain in the US to
do so. Trader Joe's has agreed to ban genetically engineered
ingredients from its thousands of own brand products. The company
stated that 'the majority of our customers would prefer to have
products made without genetically engineered ingredients'(3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive's policy comes as Greenpeace continues to distribute
the second version of the GE Free Food Guide, which outlines the GE
status of food products and companies in New Zealand. The guide is
available on the web at http://www.greenpeace.org .nz/truefood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year Tegel, Unilever, Heinz-Watties, Cerebos
Gregg's, Quality Bakers and Frucor have committed to GE Free
policies.&lt;/p&gt;

	Body bags symbolising the first casualties of the Iraqi crisis have been delivered to the Australian Consulate in Auckland.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The casualties of 'innocent people', 'public opinion' and
'international law' were delivered as Australian Prime Minister
John Howard arrived to officially open the Consulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In backing the U.S. push for war, Howard has dismissed
Australian public opposition to war," said Greenpeace No-War
spokesman, Robbie Kelman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A preventive attack on Iraq would be illegal under the terms of
the UN Charter as Australia is not in danger of imminent attack
from Iraq," said Kelman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The lives of many Iraqis will be at risk if Australia, the US
and their allies go through with threats to wage war on Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"John Howard should be working within the UN to ensure Iraq is
disarmed peacefully through the weapons inspection process rather
than committing Australian troops to military action,'' Kelman
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has participated in on-going protests condemning
Howard's support for war today, beginning at Whenuapai Airbase this
afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

	Waiheke based Greenpeace activist Henk Haazen will fly from Auckland to Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday (October 31) to turn himself in to the FBI and face charges carrying up to six years in jail for his involvement in a peaceful protest against the Star Wars programme in July (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Haazen will join fourteen other Greenpeace activists and two
freelance journalists who were arrested by the FBI following a
peaceful protest against a Star Wars missile test at Vandenberg
Airforce Base in California on July 14th(2). The test was delayed
by forty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was not amongst those arrested after the protest and as no
charges were brought against him he subsequently left the country
on his scheduled flight. In late August, a second indictment was
issued with a 'John Doe' named and he promptly contacted an
American attorney to prepare his return. On October 16th, after
Henk's lawyer contacted the US government, the prosecution issued a
third indictment covering the case charging Haazen in connection
with the protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the charge is not extradictable, Henk has decided to
voluntarily travel to the US to face trial with the other
activists. The trial is currently scheduled for November 20th
2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time Greenpeace activist, Haazen sailed to Moruroa in
1992, and 1995, as part of a peace flotilla calling for an end to
French nuclear testing. He was an engineer on board the Rainbow
Warrior when it was bombed by the French secret service in 1985 in
Auckland harbour. In 1987 he was the logistics coordinator
responsible for setting up an Antarctic base camp, as part of
Greenpeace's "World Park Antarctica" campaign. A 50- year
international moratorium on the exploitation of Antarctica was
subsequently declared in1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining why he is voluntarily coming forward Henk said: "Once
it was clear I would be charged I had to return and face trial. I
feel as strongly today about Star Wars as I did on July 14th and
facing up to the consequences of our actions and explaining them is
a fundamental principle of Greenpeace."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Charging people with a felony and up to six years in jail for a
peaceful protest is ludicrous. Although going to jail is scary, I
refuse to be intimidated by such a blatant attempt to block
opposition to Star Wars and stifle peaceful protest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: "Star Wars is a massive waste of money and human
potential. If allowed to go ahead it could kick start a whole new
arms race, and I don't think any country really wants or can afford
that. I don't believe that the only way to live together on this
planet is to say you better not mess with me because I have the
biggest guns. We have to stand up to those vested powers that keep
pouring our money and our children's future into systems that will
threaten their security instead of protecting it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both his partner Bunny and their 13-year-old daughter Ruby
support Henk in his decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Haazen's departs Auckland airport on an Air NZ6 flight at
6pm on Wednesday October 31st and arrives 9am Los Angeles (LAX),
also on Oct 31st. He will be immediately taken into custody by the
FBI and transferred to the Los Angeles Court Authorities. Both the
activists and the freelance journalists, documenting the protest
face the following charges: Conspiring to willfully and knowingly
violate an order and direction from a Captain of the Port of the
U.S. Coast Guard regarding a safety zone, knowingly enter
Vandenberg Air Force Base without permission, and aiding and
abetting each other - a Class D felony with a maximum six year
prison term and $250,000 fine. Wilfully and knowingly violating an
order and direction of a Captain of the Port of the U.S. Coast
Guard - a Class D felony with a maximum six year prison term and
$250,000 fine. Knowingly entering Vandenberg Air Force Base without
permission - a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of six months
incarceration and a $5,000 fine. If found guilty on all counts the
sentences are likely to be served concurrently. The defendants have
pleaded not guilty to the charges. It is the first time in history
that peaceful protestors at Vandenberg Air Force Base have been
charged with felonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Previously fifteen Greenpeace activists faced trial, however
charges were later dropped against one US activist Bill Hebert.
Following their arrest the activists and journalists, who include
American, Indian, Australian, German, Swedish, British and Canadian
nationals were taken to a high security federal penitentiary at
Bakersfield, California. The US nationals were granted bail
immediately, but the foreign nationals were denied bail and held
for up to ten days before being released. All had their passports
seized and the US nationals were restricted to their Home State and
the foreign nationals restricted to Central California. These
restrictions were only amended on October 16th, when the foreign
nationals were granted permission to leave the country in advance
of the trial after additional bonds were posted. &lt;/p&gt;

	Whakatane: Greenpeace and Sawmill Workers Against Poisons (SWAP) placed signs on confirmed and suspected dioxin contaminated sites around Whakatane today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The signposting draws attention to at least 25 sites around the
Whakatane area, which may have had dioxin contaminated waste dumped
on them from the disused sawmill site and the Whakatane Board Mill.
The groups want these sites to be tested for dioxin and other
dangerous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We know the Carter Holt Harvey owned sawmill site is
contaminated with dioxins, some of the most deadly chemicals ever
created by humans. Other sites must be tested for dioxins to show
whether the dumping of waste from the sawmill is contaminating
Whakatane. All dioxin contaminated sites must be properly cleaned
up on site, and not taken to other places to be destroyed, so the
contamination does not get spread to other parts of New Zealand",
said Joe Harawira of SWAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWAP is also calling for the adverse health effects of sawmill
workers from their exposure to dioxin and PCP contamination to be
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has criticised the Government's recently released
dioxin action plan because it only addresses a very small portion
of the dioxin problem in New Zealand and does not implement an
overarching policy with goal to outlaw and eliminate dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This year the Government signed an international treaty, the
Stockholm Convention, which has the goal of eliminating dioxins,
yet the dioxin action plan is ignoring that goal. Instead it
focuses only on dioxin from incinerators (which will be allowed to
continue to operate), backyard burning of rubbish, treated wood and
copper wire recycling. It fails to confront dioxin contaminated
sites such as the site in Whakatane and others like it all over the
country," says Greenpeace campaigner, Sue Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The action plan will not protect New Zealanders and indeed,
ignores some of the key requirements under the Stockholm
Convention, such as switching to clean production processes and
products, which do not cause dioxins in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government has signed the Stockholm Convention and must
once and for all address the dangers of dioxins and address the
health and environmental damage caused by polluting
industries. &lt;/p&gt;

	The New Zealand plantation industry is poised to cash in on having GE free status as a cascade of companies line up for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 'green' certification to access key USA, European and Asian markets, claimed Greenpeace today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Key forest products markets have given a very clear signal
through demanding FSC certified products - no GE thanks," said
Grant Rosoman, Forests Campaigner in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Forest Stewardship Council is explicit with one of its
forest management criteria prohibiting the use of genetically
modified organisms. The FSC is the only credible international
forest certification system."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSC Criteria 6.8 on genetic engineering of trees reads: "Use
of genetically modified organisms shall be prohibited."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2000 a National Initiative on the FSC began in New
Zealand involving all key stakeholders. Part of this initiative is
a standards setting process where the FSC set of international
Principles and Criteria for Forest Management are adapted for use
within New Zealand. A prohibition on the use of GMOs will become a
key component of this national standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Over half the plantations in New Zealand could be FSC certified
within a year, making it a world leader in certification," said
Rosoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Any release of GE organisms would potentially put these
certified areas, and therefore their access to high-value markets
at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Stewardship Council is a global forest certification
system that has certified more than 24 million hectares of
plantations and forests in 33 countries. It is a non-governmental
organisation that oversees the third-party certification to
internationally agreed forest management standards. It is supported
by most international environmental NGOs. Many buyers and markets
have stipulated a preference for FSC wood, including Home Depot and
Lowes, the largest and third largest Do-It-Yourself retailers in
USA, more than 70 UK wood product using companies with a turn-over
in excess of $30 billion, and over 700 companies from 14 countries
in the Global Forest and Trade Network.&lt;/p&gt;

	The government’s GE policy released today goes no way towards addressing the concerns raised over genetic engineering. A ‘constraint period’ on commercial release, and no substantial changes to the way field trials are conducted shows a blatant disregard for the environment and for public opinion said Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The government's position is a window dressing. By allowing GE
field trials, the decision has sidelined overwhelming rejection of
GE in the environment by the public (1) and by tangata whenua.
There is no strict liability regime, and this policy will not
protect the environment," said Annette Cotter, GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government has done no favours for the environment today,
and has failed to understand the nature of GE technology. In fact,
their criteria for field trials is weak at best. The controls will
not contain genetic material, and do not address the key concerns
that have been raised about field trials, like horizontal gene
transfer, ecological impacts, or cultural impacts of GE
testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace has no faith in ERMA, who have approved every field
trial to date. The conditions outlined by the government for field
trials do not give any further assurances. There have been many
documented breaches of GE field trial licences already in NZ,
including with salmon, tamarillos, peas and potatoes. Overseas
examples in Tasmania, Western Australia and Canada also confirm the
inability of genetic material to be contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing precautionary about the measures outlined
today," continued Cotter. "The only safe place for genetic research
is a properly contained laboratory."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pressure from the public has ensured a legislated moratorium on
commercial releases of GE, albeit for only a short time. But by
artificially differentiating between field trials and commercial
releases with their policy today, the government has fallen
woefully short of their obligations to New Zealanders, and the
integrity of the environment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many voters will be very displeased with this decision, and
each GE field trial application will be fought. The issue of
genetic engineering, and the desire for a GE free NZ will not go
away."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) A TV1 poll last week said that 62% of New Zealanders wanted
the extension of the current moratorium on field trials&lt;/p&gt;

	Giant eyeballs are protesting today at the Japanese consulate in Auckland imploring the Japanese Prime Minister not to send his whaling fleet to Antarctica to kill minke whales.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace oceans campaigner Sarah Duthie is meeting with the
Japanese senior consul, Mr Koichi Yotsaya to deliver a letter for
Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a global day of action Greenpeace protestors converged on
Japanese embassies and consulates in 17 countries (1) to deliver
the message "Don't Go Whaling! The World is Watching". Some
protestors wore bizarre "eyeballs" over their heads and thousands
of people around the world faxed or emailed similar messages to Mr
Koizumi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, on 2nd November, Greenpeace delivered petitions to the
offices of the Prime Minister and to those of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Ms Takana and the Minister of Agriculture, Forests
and Fisheries, Mr Takebe, demanding that the whaling fleet mot be
allowed to leave Shimonoseki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese whaling fleet - a factory ship, three catchers and
a spotting boat - is due to depart Tuesday or Wednesday from
Shimonoseki, Southern Japan and will travel to Antarctica to kill
440 minke whales. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has
asked the Japanese government to "halt the lethal takes of whales."
The IWC has designated Antarctica a whale sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minke whales appear to be in decline. IWC scientists are unable
to agree on how many whales are left. Scientists say the minke
population may have suffered a precipitous decline over the past
decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's protests highlight the threat of Japan ending the
moratorium on commercial whaling. Japan has admitted using overseas
aid to buy support from developing countries in the Caribbean and
elsewhere. (2) Of the 14 IWC member countries opposing the IWC's
plea to Japan, nine were developing countries implicated in the
vote buying scandal. A Caribbean Prime Minister has admitted his
country sells its vote to Japan.(3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace says the Japanese government is intensifying its
efforts to build a majority before the next IWC meeting in
Shimonoseki in May 2002. "Japan wants a return to high seas whaling
with factory ships, and it's willing to use bribery to get it,"
says Greenpeace oceans campaigner Sarah Duthie. "If the global
community doesn't stop Japan rigging the deck at the IWC we'll see
a return to the sort of whaling that devastated whale populations
all over the globe."&lt;/p&gt;

	GM lobby group Life Sciences Network (LSN) never lets the truth get in the way of a good story said Greenpeace today in response to LSN allegations of mistruth.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Containment of GE outside the laboratory is a key issue. As
local and overseas examples show, contamination is a very real
threat. In Tasmania there have been 21 breaches of field trials (1)
since 1998," said Greenpeace GE campaigner, Annette Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Commission stated 'We heard from Dr Dan Cohen of
HortResearch that he was carrying out a field trial of transgenic
tamarillos at HortResearch's Northland Research Station. We heard
considerable public doubt about the adequacy of the containment of
this trial. The Commission considers that this public concern was
justified.'(RCI Ch 6 para91)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documented in the transcripts of the Commission's hearings are
field trial containment concerns for GE potatoes and peas in
Lincoln. Cross examination from Crop and Food acknowledged that
netting for GE peas kept out the birds but was not designed to omit
pollinating insects (RCI transcript p 246), and that transgenic
potatoes were fed to delegates at a conference, prior to any food
safety evaluation of the GE potatoes (RCI transcript p 245).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, papers obtained from ERMA under the OIA (Official
Information Act) by Jeanette Fitzsimons from the Green Party
recognise concerns associated with the containment of transgenic
salmon eggs, 'some eggs could therefore pass through the screens,
be fertilized and leave the containment facility.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not a justification for saying it's all too late. In
fact, now is the time to ensure this will not happen in the future.
The only way to be sure is to restrict GE to the laboratory," said
Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We could be very easily GE free, and we're close now. However
we'll lose this opportunity if field trials commence. This is a
commonsense position, far from a fundamentalist one, and it is
shared with the majority of a very informed public."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Life Sciences Network's false claims, Greenpeace did
not apologise or withdraw testimony from the Royal Commission. The
evidence from Dr Doreen Stabinsky, Dr Terje Traavik, Dr Peter
Wills, Dr Jonathan King, Anuradha Mittal and Bill Christison on
behalf of Greenpeace to the Royal Commission was world class, and
absolutely defendable under cross- examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"LSN has distorted facts and is attempting to polarise broad
opposition to genetic engineering. Obviously working with
multinationals like Monsanto, who are well known for their attempts
to manipulate the media, has taught LSN a few dirty tricks,"
concluded Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

	To mark the launch of the new GE Free Food Guide, Greenpeace will visit supermarkets in Auckland, Manukau, North Shore and Waitakere, to hand out organic apples and the third edition of the Guide.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Customers choosing GE free food close down the market for GE
ingredients," said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The rejection of genetic engineering in our food starts in the
kitchen and the supermarket, and ends with the food chain being
free of genetic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The guide is doing what the Australia New Zealand Food
Authority (ANZFA) regulations have failed to do - it tells you what
is and isn't genetically engineered in our food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The companies that haven't removed GE will be running to catch
up because nobody wants to eat it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far 55,000 copies of the Guide have been distributed to the
public including 15, 000 downloaded from the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the major shifts in the new GE Free Food Guide include:
Unilever Australasia, Heinz Watties, Tegel and Arnotts/Campbells.
Cerebos Greggs is in the final stages of removing GE from their
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GE Free Food Guide outlines company positions on genetic
engineering. The companies are colour coded according to their
policy on the use of GE ingredients and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green category contains companies that are not using GE
originated plant and animal ingredients. This includes a policy of
no GE animal feed. This criteria goes beyond the labelling
regulations (ANZFA). Also included are certified organic products -
the best guarantee of GE free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies who have committed to removing GE originated plant and
animal ingredients and are in the process of doing so are
classified as orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red category is companies that have no clear policy of
removing GE originated ingredients. This category can include
companies that did not respond adequately to our enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

	Much of the market place is now free of genetic engineering, because some of the largest food companies in New Zealand have taken steps to remove GE from their products.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The few companies remaining in the red section of the GE Free
Food Guide are being left behind," said Annette Cotter, GE
campaigner for Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The writing is on the wall for GE, an unnecessary technology
that nobody wants to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most companies have listened to their customers' calls for GE
free food and have acted accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company positions on GE will be released in full in the third
edition of the GE Free Food Guide, due out tomorrow. Since the
first edition, in December 2000, of the guide, most of the largest
food producers have shifted to sourcing ingredients that are non
GE, and have also ensured that their animal products are not from
animals fed GE feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the major shifts in the new GE Free Food Guide
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Unilever Australasia stated that they have 'worked to
eliminate genetically modified crop derived ingredients, through
substitution, sourcing from areas where non-genetically modified
crops are grown and IP [identity preservation] systems'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Heinz Wattie's confirmed that 'over the past three years we
have investigated the source of all of our ingredients and
reformulated, where necessary, our product range to eliminate GM
content. As part of this investigation the issue of GM feed has
been considered and the same criteria applied'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Tegel and their feed distribution company NRM have confirmed
that they have no GE in their food or feed. NRM distributes 230,000
tonnes annually of maize, wheat and soymeal, and are the largest
feed company in NZ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Arnotts have moved from the red category to green with their
declaration that all their products are non GE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies are in the process of sourcing non GE
ingredients, and have made a commitment to remove GE from their
food and animal products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Cerebos Greggs 'have identified a small number of ingredients,
which are derived from genetically modified ingredients or produced
using the assistance of gene technology…These products are exempt
from labelling, however our food technologists are currently
replacing these food ingredients with non-genetically modified
alternatives…'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be distributing the guide via its website
www.gefreefood.org.nz and handing out copies of the guide around
Auckland tomorrow (details to follow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GE Free Food Guide outlines company positions on genetic
engineering. The companies are colour coded according to their
policy on the use of GE ingredients, and derivatives. The green
category is companies that are not using GE originated plant and
animal ingredients. This includes a policy of no GE animal feed.
This criteria goes beyond the labelling regulations (ANZFA). Also
included are certified organic products - the best guarantee of GE
free. Companies who have committed to removing GE originated plant
and animal ingredients and are in the process of doing so are
classified as orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red category is companies that have no clear policy of
removing GE originated ingredients. This category can include
companies that did not respond adequately to our enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Government action plan against dioxins falls short of the mark required by an international treaty, the Stockholm Convention, signed by New Zealand in May this year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Government action plan against dioxins is focused on
reducing, not on eliminating dioxins and as a result compromises
the health and environment of New Zealanders. This clearly fails
the Stockholm Convention obligations, which has a goal to eliminate
dioxins", says Greenpeace campaigner, Sue Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins are some of the most deadly chemicals known, they cause
cancer and interrupt the hormone and immune systems of humans and
animals, which in turn cause a raft of other health impacts, such
as birth defects, endometriosis and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government must set an overarching policy goal to eliminate
dioxins. Steps must then be taken to systematically outlaw all
preventable sources of dioxins", said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper, medical waste
incinerators and sites contaminated with dioxins are all examples
of sources which can and must be halted and cleaned up. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government is proposing standards for dioxin pollution to
air. While this may be a positive short term step in phasing out
waste incinerators, the goal must be set to eliminate dioxins not
provide for continued pollution". &lt;/p&gt;

	A shipload of plutonium fuel, rejected by Japan because British Nuclear Fuels falsified critical safety data, could be transported via the Tasman Sea back to England.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Two armed British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) freighters, Pacific
Pintail and the Pacific Teal, left England this morning bound for
Japan to return the plutonium, sufficient to build 50 nuclear
bombs, back to Sellafield, England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment is totally unnecessary, extremely dangerous and a
huge security risk for the Pacific," says Greenpeace Nuclear
Campaigner, Bunny McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30-mm cannons covered in white tarpaulin on the helm of the
Pacific Teal. "The UK and Japan have started the countdown to the
most controversial nuclear shipment in history, on the anniversary
of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. They could not have chosen a
more fitting date to remind the international community of the
arrogance of the nuclear industry."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plutonium-uranium oxide (MOX) shipped through the Tasman Sea
last year met stiff opposition from a flotilla of small yachts from
Australia and New Zealand. The New Zealand Government supported the
flotilla protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry is creating a floating terrorist target and a
dangerous hazard simply to get new contracts. This would result in
more shipments of plutonium, perhaps as many as 80 over the next
decade with the Tasman Sea a viable route," says Bunny
McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many en-route governments have protested these shipments. 14
Caribbean countries have already this year reminded Japan of their
"implacable opposition" to nuclear shipments through their
region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government that voices the loudest opposition may determine
which route the ships take, says McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the New Zealand Government to voice its
opposition to any nuclear shipments taking place to the Japanese
Prime Minister when he visits next week and to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships plan to pick up the MOX material at Takahama in Japan
in June, and return it to the UK in early August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear industry is keeping secret the route of the proposed
June shipment, but if it is goes ahead it will take one of three
possible routes from Japan to the UK: via the Pacific, Tasman Sea,
Cape of Good Hope, Atlantic Ocean and Irish Sea; via the Pacific,
Cape Horn, Atlantic Ocen and Irish Sea. Or via the Pacific, Panama
Canal, Caribbean, Atlantic Ocean and Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

	A report released today by Greenpeace reveals that whale blubber stored in Norway awaiting export to Japan is unfit for human consumption (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report, written by independent scientists in Germany,
concludes that the samples analysed are contaminated with
halogenated-organic contaminants such as PCBs, DDT and brominated
flame retardants (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It would be irresponsible of the Norwegian Government to export
whale blubber to Japan and irresponsible of the Japanese Government
to sell it for food. It is unfit for human consumption and should
be disposed of safely," said Thilo Maack, Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If someone ate a piece of whale blubber the size of my thumb,
they would be dosing themselves many times over the advisory limits
of some of the most toxic compounds known to humans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and Norway have been discussing a resumption in the whale
trade following Norway's decision in January 2001 to lift its ban
on whale exports. The Fisheries Agency of Japan applied to the
Trade Ministry for permission to import whale meat from Norway, but
as yet no shipments have been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway's decision to begin exporting whale meat and blubber to
Japan has been fuelled by the desire of the Norwegian whalers to
profit from the high prices paid for whale products on the luxury
food market in Japan. The export of whale products runs contrary to
the ban imposed by the Convention on the International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norwegian traders have stockpiled 1000 tonnes of whale blubber.
Last year, the Japanese Government put two hundred tonnes of unsold
whale meat and blubber in storage due to the declining market for
whale products in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report confirms the fears of environmentalists and Japanese
consumer groups that whale products are unfit for eating (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The presence of such toxic chemicals in whale blubber shows the
extent to which our oceans are contaminated and underlines how
vital it is that whales are protected from hunting, and that the
current international trade ban remains intact."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The status of minke whales hunted by Norway is uncertain and
these results show that whales are vulnerable not only to
commercial whaling but also wider environmental threats," said
Maack (4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) "Evaluation of Contaminants in Meat and Blubber of Minke
Whales" - Dr. Martin Hassauer, Jan Oltmanns, Dr. Klaus Schneider of
Forschungs- und Beratungsinstitut Gefahrstoffe GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) These are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), amongst the
most toxic chemicals known to humankind. POPs are particularly
resistant to natural breakdown and accumulate in the fatty tissues
of humans and animals. Mammals higher up the food chain, such as
whales, are particularly vulnerable to POPs. In 2001, world
governments agreed that POPs must be eliminated from the planet
under the Stockholm Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) A Norwegian university study estimates that the export
market could reach NKr50 million (US $5.5million), if 20 per cent
of the whale catch and 100 per cent of the blubber were exported.
Most of the meat would be exported to Japan, where blubber is
considered a delicacy. In protest against Norway's resumption of
whale trading, some airlines are refusing to carry the product."
Quest Economics Database World of Information Country Report April
24, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) "It is very surprising that the Japanese are encouraging the
eating of whale meat with shoppers queuing for free samples of
canned whale stew, deep-fried whale meat and blubber recipes in
downtown Tokyo," Dr. Stone said. "Unfortunately, what these
unsuspecting consumers probably received was a cocktail of toxins
and contaminants that have made their way into our seas and oceans,
particularly during the last 50 years." Parliamentary Secretary for
the Antarctic, Australia, Dr. Sharman Stone, Media Release, 12
April 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There is evidence that toxic pollution, ship noise, ozone
depletion, global warming, and overfishing threaten whale
populations. For more information see the Greenpeace report,
"Whales In A Degraded Ocean" (available on the Greenpeace
website). &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called for field trials to be included in any moratorium, while supporting the cautious approach outlined by the Prime Minister regarding NZ’s policy on genetic engineering.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The line must be drawn at the laboratory door. Any release into
the environment will lead to contamination. Examples here and
overseas show that genetic material cannot be contained in field
trials. Therefore it is critical to ensure that the Government
position halts all releases into the environment," said Annette
Cotter, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tasmania, there have been 21 documented breaches of GE field
trials (1), and in New Zealand field trials of genetically
engineered peas, potatoes, salmon and tamarillos have had
containment breaches. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government is responding to the uncertainty and concerns
raised by the Royal Commission's report. In acknowledging that our
clean green image cannot be compromised, Ms Clark is assuming a
sensible approach to GE," said Cotter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Keeping options open by keeping GE in the lab is a pragmatic
position to take. Lab based research can continue with our
environment being GE free. This is the best of both worlds."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace questioned the blatant contradiction in Fonterra's statement on genetic engineering today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Fonterra's CEO Craig Norgate stated that any support for genetic
engineering 'does not mean that we wish to use genetically modified
ingredients in our products.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although hailing the unrealistic promises of genetic
engineering, the reality is that Fonterra do not want to use GE in
their dairy. Fonterra's blind support for genetic engineering
assumes people are going to start accepting GE in their food chain.
World market trends are quite the opposite," said Annette Cotter,
Greenpeace Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People don't want GE in their food or their environment, which
is why Fonterra won't use GE in their dairy. Why on earth don't we
make the most of this and ensure an ongoing market advantage,
rather than doggedly pursuing a GE dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The refusal of NZ dairy foods in Sri Lanka earlier this year
(1) confirms market rejection of GE, and Fonterra is uniquely
poised to supply GE free dairy to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By ignoring the wishes of the public, and bullying the
government over NZ's GE free status, Fonterra's behaviour is
completely inappropriate and economically nonsensical," said
Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The dairy products couldn't be proven to be GE free,
therefore they were rejected by Sri Lanka who has a GE free
policy.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called on Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, visiting New Zealand for bilateral discussions, to stop his country's whaling industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Whaling is an unnecessary and unsustainable industry. The
Japanese Government has spent more than Y40 billion in subsidies to
the whaling industry and in buying votes with foreign aid at the
International Whaling Commission (IWC)," said Greenpeace Oceans
Campaigner Sarah Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is calling on Prime Minister Koizumi to save face
and stop whaling. Why waste money on a dying industry that only
makes Japan unpopular in the rest of the world?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) is campaigning for a
resumption of commercial whaling in the lead up to the annual IWC
meeting in the Japanese whaling town of Shimonoseki this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAJ has embarked upon an aggressive marketing campaign to
increase the demand for whale meat, including free whale meat
tastings. There is virtually no market for whale meat in Japan
except as a luxury food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"FAJ public relations spokespeople say that whaling is part of
Japanese food culture, and the rest of the world has no right to
tell Japan what to do. Our argument is not with the Japanese or
their food culture, our argument is with the FAJ. The truth is
whaling has always led to depletion of whale populations, and
Japanese whaling has followed the same destructive course as other
whaling nations," said Duthie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and New Zealanders opposed to whaling will gather
outside the Duxton Hotel on Wakefield St where Mr Koizumi is
staying, between 6:00-7:40pm.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace New Zealand today urged the Government to stop listening to polluters and their scare-mongering and adopt immediate domestic policy responses to global climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Avoiding action now to tackle climate change is delaying the
inevitable. The world will change its economic base in order to
deal with this global issue," said Greenpeace New Zealand Climate
Campaigner, Robbie Keman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The New Zealand government has been heavily influenced by
lobbying from polluting industries to defer action, and will miss
the boat on new technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A possible carbon levy in 2007 of $25 a tonne is too long
coming and will be fiercely resisted by big industry polluters who
always try and avoid paying for their effects on the
environment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Government has emphasised forest sinks will meet
Kyoto targets and perhaps provide the Government with a surplus of
carbon credits to sell overseas. "An over reliance on forest sinks
to meet Kyoto targets is a major flaw in world efforts to combat
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The real issue is how New Zealand moves away from a reliance on
fossil fuels to becoming a totally renewable energy economy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given the Government's encouraging leadership on deciding to
ratify the Kyoto Protocol it is disappointing to see such a weak
policy position in implementation. A delay of five years is totally
unacceptable."&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called on the British Government to end its continued support for Japan's plutonium programme and to cancel an imminent plutonium shipment from Japan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists delivered a letter opposing the latest
shipment, along with a mock drum of plutonium-uranium oxide (MOX),
to the British Consul General, Stephen Turner, in Queen St,
Auckland today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The plutonium trade is completely unnecessary, highly dangerous
and a potential terrorist target," said Greenpeace New Zealand
Campaign Manager Glyn Walters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is here today to sound the alarm and ask the British
Government to intervene immediately to stop the shipments through
the Pacific".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two armed British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) freighters, Pacific
Pintail and the Pacific Teal, left England on Friday bound for
Japan, to return rejected plutonium shipped with falsified critical
safety data by BNFL. This could be transported via the Tasman
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan demanded the return of the material as a pre-condition for
any further plutonium MOX contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The UK and Japan arrogantly refuse to warn countries en route
in advance, or to consult them on environmental and security risks.
Millions of people around the world have a right to know of the
dangers they are being exposed to because of the arrogance and
incompetence of the nuclear industry," said Mr Walters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment needs to be stopped and we will do all we can to
peacefully prevent it happening," Mr Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace ship MV Esperanza has set sail for Japan to
oppose the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace would use its ship and other resources to 'sound the
alert' on this shipment. The organisation is also considering legal
action to stop the return shipment because it would breach UK and
international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNFL and the British Government hope that the return shipment
from Japan in June, which includes 255 kilograms of plutonium,
enough plutonium for 50 nuclear bombs, will result in contracts to
ship more than 25,000 kilograms of plutonium to Japan over the next
decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only three weeks ago, a senior Japanese politician, Ichiro
Ozawa, stated that Japan could make thousands of nuclear weapons
using its plutonium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A massive expansion of Japan's plutonium programme pivots on
this proposed shipment of reject material back to the UK, " says Mr
Walters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route of the June shipment from Japan to the UK remains
secret but Japanese officials have confirmed it will be one of
three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via the Pacific, Panama Canal, Caribbean, Atlantic Ocean and
Irish Sea;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via the Pacific, Cape Horn, Atlantic Ocean and Irish Sea;&lt;/p&gt;

Greenpeace delivers “whale meat” to Japanese ambassador</title><date>2002-04-23 00:00:00</date><text>
	In four weeks, the fate of the world’s whales will be decided at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) with the pro-whaling group likely to get a majority vote.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To highlight their plight, Greenpeace today presented the
Japanese Ambassador to New Zealand a petition signed by marine and
cetacean biologists from around the world, calling on the Japanese
Government to end "scientific" whaling, as well as delivering
replica whale meat boxes representing the hypocrisy of Japanese
"scientific" whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whales hunted in the name of science are destined for the
tables of restaurants and the shelves of supermarkets as a
delicacy, despite a diminishing market in Japan," said Greenpeace
Oceans Campaigner, Pia Mancia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, scientific whaling is commercial whaling in
disguise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is concerned that the Government of Japan cannot
control its Fisheries Agency, which is intent on a resumption of
commercial whaling despite the fact whales have still to recover
from the previous decimation of whale populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese Fisheries Agency is out of control and Greenpeace
is asking the Government of Japan to reign them in."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract a decrease in whale meat consumption in Japan the
Fisheries Agency has launched a high profile public relations
campaign, handing out free whale meat samples and promoting reasons
why people should eat whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year a Fisheries Agency senior official admitted some
nations have sold their vote at IWC in return for foreign aid from
Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the Fisheries Agency succeed in gaining a voting majority
they will be able to expand their present whaling activities and
overturn the moratorium on commercial whaling, a return to factory
ship whaling of the kind that decimated whale populations in the
past; overturn the Indian Ocean whale sanctuary, and restart
commercial trade with Norway and other countries which may also
decide to restart whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand was one of 14 countries worldwide raising awareness
to the underhanded tactic that the Japanese Fishery Agency is using
to force a resume of commercial whaling. &lt;/p&gt;

	AREVA Cherbourg – During a marine environment sampling campaign, right at the end of the outflow pipe of the Areva-Cogema plant in La Hague, Greenpeace has put radioactive wastes in a champagne bottle. The environmental organisation intends to deliver this “Areva vintage” bottle to the French Challenge team, based in Lorient (Brittany), in order to have it used during the naming ceremony of the French sailing ship which will participate in the upcoming America’s Cup.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Through this symbolic action, Greenpeace intends to highlight
the operations of Areva, the new nuclear holding and main sponsor
of the French Challenge, whose subsidiary company Cogema's
plutonium extraction operations are one of the biggest radioactive
pollution sources in the world. "Each year, Areva-Cogema discharges
millions of litres of radioactive waste into the Channel," explains
Yannick Rousselet, Nuclear Campaigner for Greenpeace France. "These
discharges contaminate the North Atlantic and are now condemned by
the whole international community, especially within the OSPAR
Convention (1)," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Greenpeace has been actively denouncing the plutonium
industry, especially nuclear waste reprocessing. "Despite protests
which are now international, despite the studies stressing the
dangers and harmfulness of reprocessing, and despite government
commitments, reprocessing still benefits from an exception regime
and skips democratic discussion," said Frederic Marillier, Nuclear
Campaigner for Greenpeace France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, Greenpeace launched a new denouncing and
questioning campaign in order to bring about the debate on
reprocessing during this elections period. Delivering an "Areva
Vintage" bottle of champagne to the French Challenge is part of
this campaign. A special convoy will be formed tomorrow at 15:00 in
Dielette harbour, for the transportation of radioactive waste to
Lorient.&lt;/p&gt;

	The French nuclear industry group, Areva is leasing New Zealand's 1995 America's Cup boat, "Black Magic" as a promotion tool in its campaign to promote its dirty nuclear business.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Black Magic" headed by Sir Peter Blake brought the Cup to NZ
after winning the race in San Diego in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The leasing of Black Magic is adding insult to injury," said
Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Its quite unbelievable, first they hijack the race itself to
promote one of the most dirty and dangerous businesses on the
planet and now they have hijacked Sir Peter's boat to assist in
that bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You have to wonder what they are thinking. This is not just any
old boat. This is the boat that brought the cup to NZ and skippered
by a man who in his later days redirected his sailing to advance
the cause of protecting the oceans." "The tragic irony is that the
boat is now being used by a company that is involved in polluting
the oceans on a daily basis."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Peter Blake gave his support to the nuclear free Tasman
flotilla last year when seven boats sailed out to protest a
shipment of plutonium fuel that an Areva company was making. He
said, "I thoroughly agree with a stand being made to protect the
oceans from what will, given time, cause a catastrophe of unheard
of proportions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is opposed to Areva's sponsorship because its
subsidiary companies have polluted the seas around France and
Moruroa and its activities continue to put the global environment
and the health of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.
Moreover, the activities and interests of Areva continue to be
central to the French nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areva is the major sponsor of the French entry in the America's
Cup sailing race.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is demanding swift and serious action from the New Zealand government, following the completion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report "Mitigation of Climate Change" outlines a range of
options for what can be done to reduce the impact of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It's quite clear that immediate action to cut emissions is
needed", said Vanessa Atkinson, climate campaigner from Greenpeace
New Zealand. "Further procrastination could have a devastating
effect on the lives of billions of people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The report specifies we need to keep a global temperature
increase well below 2 degrees Centigrade, which means global
emissions must peak by 2015 and come down rapidly to 50% below 1990
levels by2050."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also confirms what the UK Government's Stern report
said in October, which was that the cost of doing nothing about
emissions is likely to far outweigh the cost of taking action to
reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IPCC report, stabalising emissions between 450
and 550 ppm (parts per million) would cost from 0.2 per cent to
less than 3 per cent of GDP in 2030, or less than 0.1 per cent per
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures for the cost of doing nothing aren't given, but the
Stern report found inaction could cost 5-10% of global GDP each
year. Under the worst case scenario, it could rise to as much as
20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In order to play our part, New Zealand must deal with our own
emissions, which continue to rise and which are at unacceptable
levels compared with many other OECD countries. Just today we've
learnt our emissions shot up 2.8 percent (2.1 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide equivalents) between 2004 and 2005."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Atkinson said Greenpeace had worked with international and
local consultants to find the best way to mitigate climate change
in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The resulting report - New Zealand Energy Revolution: How to
prevent climate chaos - shows it's entirely possible to achieve a
100 per cent renewable electricity sector by 2025 and cut our
carbon emissions by 72% by 2050. We can do this without harming
economic growth, largely by using renewable energy sources, and
encouraging energy efficiency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Energy Revolution document rules out nuclear power and the
use of carbon capture and storage as options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand must immediately implement an economy-wide price on
greenhouse pollution, including agriculture, and establish legally
binding targets for emission reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We must also set in place clear policies to achieve a 100%
renewable electricity sector and to encourage public transport,"
said Ms Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Kathy Cumming (Communications Officer) 021 495 216&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; Note to editors:

	Greenpeace today welcomed new plans by the Carbon Market Working Group to establish a carbon emissions trading platform, but warned New Zealand's focus should be on reducing emissions, rather than just trading credits.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is a step in the right direction and carbon trading will
play an important role in tackling climate change, but it's
important that the top priority is reducing emissions rather than
just offsetting them," said Greenpeace climate campaigner Vanessa
Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We need to see behavioural changes and investment choices that
favour low emission technologies and practices such as renewable
energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The big risk is that companies or individuals can now buy a
credit on the market and feel like they've done something about
climate change, but not actually reduce their own emissions. That
won't solve climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For example people need to be flying less rather than just
buying credits to offset their flight emissions, as Air New Zealand
is encouraging people to do (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NZX chief executive Mark Weldon cited the potential benefits of
New Zealand's clean green image in the emerging international
carbon market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But markets and our overseas investors will not be fooled by
greenwash and will demand that New Zealand is serious about the
issue and actually cuts greenhouse pollution. We have already seen
the sensitivity of the UK market to the issue of 'food miles' from
New Zealand agricultural products. New Zealand needs to live up to
its rhetoric and put a price on greenhouse pollution across the
economy and set strong emission reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However, gaining experience in the carbon market will be
important for New Zealand particularly as the Government indicated
last week it's preference for an emissions trading scheme for New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent OECD report into New Zealand's environmental
performance was critical of the country in not having a price on
greenhouse pollution and being inexperienced in using Kyoto's
flexible mechanisms, which include carbon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Kathy Cumming, Communications Officer, 021 495 216

	On the 10th of July 2010, it will be 25 years since the Rainbow Warrior was sunk by French spies in Auckland’s harbour, killing Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereria. The Rainbow Warrior was targeted because of Greenpeace’s anti-nuclear campaign and plans to sail to French Polynesia to protest against the French testing of nuclear weapons.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will mark the anniversary by taking a vital step in
the escalation of its campaign to prevent catastrophic climate
change. On the day of the anniversary in Poland the keel of the
Rainbow Warrior III will be laid. The organisation's first
purpose-built ship, it will enable Greenpeace to take its
technical, advocacy, and actions work into a new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace has been at the cutting edge when it comes to
threats against the planet," says Greenpeace New Zealand's
Executive Director, Bunny McDiarmid. "When the French bombed our
ship in 1985, nuclear war was the world's greatest threat, and
climate change was only just beginning to be understood. That was
25 years ago and still we have not seen the necessary response from
governments to prevent dangerous climate change," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's going to take real action - not just on the part of
Greenpeace, with the Rainbow Warrior III, but also the world - if
we are going to have any chance of preventing dangerous climate
change," says McDiarmid, who was a deckhand on board the first
Rainbow Warrior when it was bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that we know what causes climate change and
exactly what needs to be done to stop it - and many of the
technologies we need already exist. What is lacking is the
political will at both the national and international level to put
in place policies that will enable the necessary emission
reductions and a shift in attitude to the way we run our economies
so they are not at the expense of our environment. Climate change
is the latest and strongest indication yet that we need to change
the way in which we are living on this planet," says McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Jay Harkness, Greenpeace NZ communications and media, 021 495 216&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; Bunny McDiarmid is available for interviews between now and the anniversary. She can give a first-hand account of the night’s events, talk about the Rainbow Warrior III, describe how both she and Greenpeace have changed since the bombing, and what the future holds for the organisation she has worked in for so long.

Greenpeace New Zealand will be marking the occasion by holding an intimate event in its Mt Eden office on the night of the 10th.

	Tomorrow Governments will begin a week long meeting in Chile to negotiate a new fisheries regime for the South Pacific region will have their best chance yet to fully implement commitments they made at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2006 to protect the high seas from the destructive fishing practice of bottom trawling (1).

            07-June-2005: North West Challenger Plateau Tasman Sea:  Greenpeace activists disrupt the setting of a bottom trawl net by attaching an inflatable liferaft. The bottom trawl vessel is the 'Ocean Reward' owned by New Zealand company Talley's Fisheries.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from New Zealand and countries throughout the
South Pacific plus the European Union (EU), Japan, Russia, China,
South Korea, the US and others have gathered in Renaca, (Chile) to
discuss the establishment of a new Regional Fisheries Management
Organisation (RFMO), which will manage the South Pacific region,
one of the largest unregulated areas of ocean in the world. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org"&gt;With the exception&lt;/a&gt; of the tuna
fishery, the South Pacific high seas are essentially 'free-for-all'
fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, these governments made a commitment at the United
Nations General Assembly to protect the high seas from bottom
trawling, one of the most destructive fishing practices, which
destroys vulnerable deep sea ecosystems on seamounts and cold water
coral reefs. The UN Resolution called on countries at the South
Pacific negotiations to protect deep sea ecosystems or else to
prohibit high seas bottom trawling by December 2007 (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ink is barely dry on the UNGA Resolution," said Helen
Oakey, Greenpeace International Political Advisor. "States must
meet the commitments they made at the UN to implement measures to
protect these vulnerable ecosystems and to prove that their bottom
trawl fleets will not damage deep-sea ecosystems. If they can't do
this by the deadlines set, they must prohibit their vessels from
engaging in destructive fishing practices."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawling involves dragging huge, heavy nets fitted with
large metal plates along the sea floor, crushing everything in
their path. Large nets collect not only target species but also
catch and kill non-target species. These fisheries have targeted
the uniquely rich biodiversity of underwater sea mountains, home to
species of cold water corals, soft seapens, sponges and seawhips,
sea spiders and lobster-like crustaceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom trawl fleets have increasingly expanded onto the high
seas as fish stocks have been depleted within coastal waters.
Bottom trawling in the South Pacific targets orange roughy, a
species that takes 30 years to mature, but which has became a
prized fish largely exported to the United States and been depleted
within coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Global fish stocks are in a perilous state, largely because of
the failure of the fisheries organisations to manage fish stocks
properly," said Mike Hagler, Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans
Campaigner. "This is an opportunity for governments to avoid making
the same mistakes that have led to stock declines in the northern
hemisphere. The South Pacific agreement must have all the
ingredients required for a "best practice" RFMO: one that takes
both a precautionary and an ecosystem approach, taking into account
all environmental factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1) The meeting to negotiate a new Regional Fisheries Management Organization for the South Pacific its taking place in Renaca (Chile) from Monday 30th April to Friday 4th May.

(2) The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution A/61/105 by consensus on 8 December 2006.  Paragraphs 80-91 of the Resolution establish the international agreement for action on high seas bottom fishing.

	Greenpeace today urged the New Zealand Government not to back down on proposals which could put an end to New Zealand high seas bottom trawling in the South Pacific by the end of the year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Delegates from more than 22 countries are in Chile this week
negotiating the formation of a new regional fisheries management
organization in the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand had tabled a proposal at the start of the week which
would have constrained and possibly put an end to the New Zealand
fishing industry's ability to continue bottom trawling in
international waters of the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Greenpeace New Zealand oceans campaigner Mike Hagler said he
was gravely concerned the government would bow to pressure by
agreeing to a weaker regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand and Australia have positioned themselves as being
highly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;supportive of strong measures to conserve and protect deep sea
life from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;destructive bottom trawling in international waters. But the
threat is that behind closed doors, they'll agree to a weak regime
full of loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"More importantly, there's a risk that governments at the
meeting may agree on measures that mean they'll fail to meet
obligations agreed at the UN General Assembly last December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In Greenpeace's view, the strong statement made by New Zealand
at the beginning of the negotiations sets the standard for the
Government and outlines the action they're obliged to take
uni-laterally," said Mike Hagler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As a result, we'd expect that, before the end of the year, the
New Zealand-flagged bottom trawling fleet will not be able to fish
in international waters unless they meet specific
requirements."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the countries at these negotiations, New Zealand has the
biggest interest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in bottom trawling in the South Pacific, with responsibility for
over 90% of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bottom fishing in international waters in the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Kathy Cumming 021 495 216

	In the midst of one of the worst oil spills in history the Government’s offshore oil exploration announcement sounds like a bad joke, says Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But unbelievably - like mining plans - the Government does
actually think drilling for oil and digging up coal in the 21st
century is a good idea.&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner Simon Boxer said&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;burning oil had a
serious effect on climate change and the risks from drilling - such
as the ongoing Gulf of Mexico oil disaster - highlighted how our
dependency on fossil fuels damaged people, economies and the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite feeble assurances from the John Key, in the Herald
today, offshore drilling is not safe. The BP disaster in the Gulf
of Mexico shows that it is extremely difficult to control
activities in the deep sea," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the president of the wealthiest and most powerful country in
the world can't stop an offshore oil spill then how is John Key
going to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has awarded the drilling contract to Petrobras
that has a shocking safety and environmental record as its oil rig
disaster of 2001 demonstrates." (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only have to imagine a Louisiana-style oil spill along New
Zealand's coastline and the spectacular East Cape to understand
what is at stake here. Significant fisheries, fragile coastal
ecology and birdlife, a tourism hotspot and New Zealand's clean,
green reputation will be put at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One gulf of Mexico type oil disaster in New Zealand could cause
permanent ecological harm and cost the economy billions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the right direction for New Zealand. These sorts of
extractive 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century industries like coal mining and
oil drilling are boom and bust economics - they earn money for a
few international corporations and leave a big mess for the rest of
us.&lt;span class="empty_class"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The cost
benefit equation just doesn't stack up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxer said that in the era of climate change New Zealand should
be investing in clean technologies not regressing to 19th century
extractive industry of dirty old oil and coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant international endorsement
of Adrian Macey’s skills and experience as a diplomat,” said Greenpeace New
Zealand’s political advisor in &lt;city&gt;&lt;place&gt;Bonn&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/city&gt;,
Geoff Keey.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ambassador Macey was elected last night (NZ time) at the closing plenary of
Kyoto Protocol negotiations in &lt;city&gt;Bonn&lt;/city&gt; despite
earlier objections of some countries that did not want a &lt;country-region&gt;&lt;place&gt;New Zealand&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;
chair.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Ambassador Macey has a huge challenge ahead of him to help shepherd developed
countries through the process of adopting new commitments under the Kyoto
Protocol.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“This will be a massive challenge because the combined pledges of developed
countries are well below the level needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate
change and some are reluctant to fulfill their promise to take on a second
commitment under the Protocol.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Adrian Macey’s nomination faced a difficult road because some developing
countries doubted &lt;country-region&gt;&lt;place&gt;New
Zealand&lt;/place&gt;&lt;/country-region&gt;’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.
The Government should actively support Ambassador’s Macey’s role by pledging to
take on new and ambitious commitments under the Protocol.”&lt;br&gt;

	The Government would be wise to chalk up its schedule 4 mining plans as an idea it got horribly wrong, says Greenpeace in its submission on the proposals. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace added its submission today to tens of thousands
opposing the plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government asked for public input and the public has
responded with a resounding no to mining the best of pure New
Zealand," said Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid.
"People have said no to a 19th century approach to economic growth,
no to an international backlash, and no to squandering the
environment and climate for a tiny and short-term gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If Key's government is wise it will go away and come back with
viable, modern economic development proposals that boost our
economy in a way that doesn't threaten our environment and values.
Ministers and officials should be taking New Zealand down a green
development path."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace submission also questioned the harm caused in the
international arena when the Government seemed to "speak with a
forked tongue" on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government's mining proposals cast a negative pall on New
Zealand's reputation internationally as a good-faith participant in
international agreements to tackle global climate change and
protect biodiversity. When John Key is prepared to mine our
National Parks for massive quantities of coal to burn here in New
Zealand, it makes a mockery of claims he takes climate change
seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Right when the rest of the world is making serious commitments
to addressing climate change and biodiversity decline, New Zealand
is going backwards.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has one of the highest rates of per capita emissions
in the OECD and the mining - among other ill conceived policies -
will make that problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government seems to assume that mining expansion and our
positive reputation can co-exist, but evidence suggests otherwise.
The economic risk of harming New Zealand's multi-billion dollar
tourism industry should be enough of a deterrent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; Greenpeace’s full submission can be found here: www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/press/reports/schedule-4-submission&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace supporters have set up a whale graveyard in front of the Beehive in reaction to further details released today of a proposal which could legitimise commercial whaling and allow hunting to continue in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The proposal is the basis for negotiation between now and the
next International Whaling Commission (IWC) in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details released this morning &lt;a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC62docs/iwc62docs.htm"&gt;
(1)&lt;/a&gt; reveal that although the proposal makes a reduction to
whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary it includes a quota
for hunting endangered fin whales. There is no fixed date for an
end to the hunting in the sanctuary and no agreement on maintaining
international trade restrictions. Over the 10 years that this
proposal will run there is no reduction in the quotas in the
northern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 200 people have gathered on parliament grounds carrying
placards in the shape of whale tails, stamped with the letters
R.I.P?, symbolising what is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our Government has a choice. Support a proposal that could
result in a real whale graveyard or fight for a proposal which
protects the future of whales and upholds New Zealand's long
tradition of whale conservation," said Greenpeace New Zealand
Executive Director Bunny McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is campaigning for an end to commercial whaling
including all whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand now has an opportunity to break the deadlock in the
IWC but the challenge will be to ensure that any final agreement
guarantees a safe future for whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"IWC members need to fully commit to the negotiations to get the
deal the whales need, or else this could be remembered as the
moment we agreed to return to commercial whaling and the start of
the whales' demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IWC should also be investigating allegations of major
corruption in the Japanese Government funded whaling programme,
made by two Greenpeace activists currently on trial in Japan,
rather than rewarding Japan for bending the rules of the Commission
in order to continue whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of New Zealanders are calling on the Government to
reject any proposal which does not ensure the long term protection
for whales, including an end to whaling in the Southern Ocean, by
signing petitions promoted by Greenpeace, World Society for
Protection of Animals, Forest and Bird, Whale and Dolphin
Conservation Society and Project Jonah.(2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The petitions will be presented to the Government during a
public rally outside parliament on June 2 at 12.30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

	According to the most substantive poll on the mining issue to date, the Key Government’s mining plans are opposed by 30% of those who voted National in at the last election (1). 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is sobering news for National; that one in every three
people who supported the election of John Key did not do so in the
expectation that our most protected conservation land would be
opened up for mining," said Greenpeace Executive Director Bunny
McDiarmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This survey result is further clarification that the only
sensible thing is for the Government's mining plans to be
scrapped."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes the mining plans are a breach of core Kiwi
values. The poll confirms that these values largely transcend
political affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are a classic example of this Government's brand of 19th
century thinking," said  McDiarmid. "They're happy to put
short-term profit ahead of the long-term wellbeing of the economy
and the environment. This is a real risk for New Zealand's image
and bottom line."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 40,000 people marched against the mining of schedule four
land on May 1st in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt; (1)    According to the ShapeNZ nationwide survey of 2,215 New Zealanders, May 13-18, 2010 – “Among those who voted National [by party vote] in the 2008 general election 53% support removing [Schedule 4] protection, 30% oppose while 14% are neutral and 2% don’t know.”

	For more than a century, people have relied on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas for their transport, heating and electricity generation. Now worldwide people and the environment are experiencing the consequences. Global warming is the most serious environmental problem we face today. The evidence that our climate is changing is overwhelming.

	Greenpeace activists have blocked the coal depot of Fonterra’s Clandeboye factory near Timaru, using a truckload of alternative fuel, saying the company is damaging the climate by burning coal when cleaner solutions exist.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They have dumped three tonnes of wood pellets in the depot which
supplies coal to the boilers and four have locked themselves to
equipment to stop coal deliveries. They are calling on Fonterra -
the country's third largest coal user and one of our biggest
emitters - to switch to a cleaner fuel source without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're also highlighting that the Government's schedule 4
mining plans include mining 3,000 ha of the Paparoa National Park
for coal, which is destined for Fonterra plants (1). Over 40,000
people marched against the plans earlier this month (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fonterra's decision to run its factories on coal rather than
clean alternatives epitomizes not only the global climate crisis,
but also the very serious economic challenge facing New Zealand"
said Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Simon Boxer. "Both the
Government and Fonterra continue to put short-term profit ahead of
the long-term wellbeing of the economy and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Following Greenpeace's action last November against the lignite
coal mine supplying Fonterra's Edendale milk powder factory,
Fonterra hinted it might look at cleaner alternatives to coal (3).
Nearly six months later vast quantities of coal are still pouring
into Fonterra's boilers," said Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The climate cannot wait and we want a clear answer from
Fonterra. Meanwhile the Government needs to forget its 19th century
thinking and show the country it's capable of leading it towards a
modern, smart, clean economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ignoring the climate crisis and mining coal, including from
National Parks, to burn in Fonterra factories producing low value
milk powder for the commodities market, is nothing short of
criminal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxer said Fonterra's intensification model for dairy was
driving up emissions and undermining New Zealand's clean and green
reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The international accounting firm KPMG recently questioned the
future of Fonterra's intensive dairy business model (4). Fonterra's
backward vision is not going to add value to the New Zealand
economy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood pellets and other biomass products of the timber industry
are viable alternatives to coal which burn cleaner, release less
carbon dioxide and are renewable, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's action is part of an ongoing campaign by Greenpeace to
highlight and stop Fonterra's climate crimes. Over the last 10
months Greenpeace has exposed links between Fonterra's
supplementary palm kernel animal feed from Indonesia and the
devastation of rainforests (5) and highlighted its use of coal to
power its factories, which is driving coal mining and carbon
emissions in New Zealand (6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Simon Boxer, Greenpeace New Zealand climate campaigner, 021 905 579

	In a proposal being drawn up for the International Whaling Commission (IWC), New Zealand and Australian taxpayers may have to pay for a return to commercial whaling. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The proposal would legitimise commercial whaling and even allow
hunting to continue in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of following a "user pays" principle, which would see
the whaling nations - Japan, Norway and Iceland - bear the cost for
management and supervision of the whaling industry, under the
proposal, all countries party to the International Whaling
Commission will foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is bad enough to try to sell this appalling deal to New
Zealanders, but it's a complete insult to ask them to pay for it as
well," said Philippa Brakes from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation
Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Government is known to be deeply unhappy with the
proposal which would include bringing back legal commercial whaling
but the New Zealand Government and its IWC Commissioner, Sir
Geoffrey Palmer, are promoting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Government has issued a counter proposal which
includes phasing out whaling in the Southern Ocean over five years.
Australia's proposal has not received the support of the New
Zealand Government&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The so-called compromise package, being hailed by New Zealand
as a breakthrough, appears to reward whaling countries for years of
ignoring the global moratorium on commercial whaling and now
presents them with commercial whaling quotas tied up with a
ribbon," said Erica Martin from IFAW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Australians and New Zealanders are united in their opposition
to commercial whaling - they will never accept this deal let alone
pay for it," said Nicola Beynon from Humane Society
International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In their haste to resolve the impasse in the IWC, NZ could end
up supporting a deal that in fact takes us back to the grim days of
commercial whaling that drove many species to the brink of
extinction last century. New Zealand must stand with its
traditional whale conservation allies such as Australia if there's
to be any chance of achieving a future that's good for the whales,"
said Greenpeace New Zealand Oceans Campaigner Karli Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, Humane Society International, IFAW (the
International Fund for Animal Welfare), Project Jonah, Whale and
Dolphin Conservation Society, World Society for the Protection of
Animals and Whales Alive are all calling on the New Zealand
Government not to betray the anti-whaling New Zealand electorate,
nor their friends in Australia, and have an urgent re-think of any
compromises that will undermine their long standing opposition to
commercial whaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firm proposals for the new whaling deal will be put forward by
22 April to be voted on at the International Whaling Commission
meeting in Morocco in June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; In New Zealand:

	Greenpeace says the kind of international backlash seen today in the Economist magazine (1) demonstrates that John Key’s Government is putting the New Zealand economy at risk with its 19th century economic thinking. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Unless it changes direction quickly, the National-led
Government will go down in history as the administration that
presided over the collapse of New Zealand's clean green
reputation," said Greenpeace Campaigner Simon Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That reputation has been built up over many decades but could
disappear overnight. If the brand goes, so does the country's
reputation as a premier tourist destination and supplier of quality
exports."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many Kiwis have jobs today that directly benefit from New
Zealand's clean, green brand. To threaten the brand by returning to
19th century industrial policies is to risk economic suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Its no skin off the nose of the global mining industry if New
Zealand's reputation collapses, but it will be a tragedy for
tourism, agriculture and fishing.  John Key needs to let go of
outmoded economic thinking that cannot serve New Zealand in a world
that's moving towards a green industrial future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxer quoted the article, which is the latest in a string of
international exposes blowing the cover on "Clean Green NZ".  "The
difference between New Zealand and other places is that New Zealand
has actively sold itself as "100% Pure".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article says New Zealanders themselves have acknowledged the
gap between the claim and reality. "Now it's just a matter of the
truth getting out to the rest of the world," said Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article draws on New Zealand's rising greenhouse gas
emissions and recent proposals to mine conservation land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's as if climate change doesn't even exist for John Key and
his party. They are planning to mine coal from a National Park on
the West Coast, to burn domestically, mostly by Fonterra (2). The
emissions from the extraction and burning of that coal are equal to
half of New Zealand's total annual emissions. (3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This contradicts the Government's rhetoric at Copenhagen, where
it claimed to take the global threat of climate change
seriously."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government to offer an economic
vision for the 21st century that plays to the strength of our clean
and green reputation and meets the challenges of climate change.
This includes dropping plans to remove key conservation land from
Schedule Four, and committing to a 40% by 2020 emissions reduction
target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other contacts:&lt;/b&gt; Simon Boxer: Senior Climate Campaigner -021905579

	Greenpeace, attending the climate talks in the Hague over the past two days, said that generally New Zealand had taken a constructive role.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"However New Zealand's negotiating allies Canada and Australia
have taken seriously regressive positions, for example they are
trying to resurrect the inclusion of nuclear energy in the Kyoto
talks", said Bill Hare, Greenpeace Climate Policy Director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March this year Bush announced that the USA was withdrawing
from the Kyoto Protocol, turning its back on 10 years of work by
the nations of the world to prevent global warming. It was reported
from the meeting at the Hague that the USA has been on the verge of
obstructing progress, contrary to President Bush's promise to EU
leaders in Gothenberg two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan is also trying to seek more concessions at the talks in
the Hague so threatening the future of the Kyoto Protocol. Unless
Japan comes to its senses, it could sink the Kyoto Protocol
negotiations in Bonn in two weeks time", said Hare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of these 'informal' climate talks in the Hague
on the future of Kyoto Protocol, it is clear that Australia, Canada
and Japan have taken up very regressive positions, particularly on
the question of sinks(1). Australia and Canada want virtually
unlimited use of sink activities, and it was precisely these
demands which were one of the main causes for the collapse of the
COP6 negotiations at the Hague last year. While the EU appears to
have made substantial concessions, the reaction of these countries
has been to demand more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hare said, "In the case of Canada and Australia this indicates a
lack of political will to implement and ratify the Kyoto Protocol
without the USA. The Japanese government clearly has not yet made a
decision as to whether it will ratify without the USA."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that the US is increasingly isolated. Others in its
"Umbrella Group", such as Norway, New Zealand and Iceland have been
generally constructive. It is essential that New Zealand takes a
strong position immediately and recommits to ratifying the Kyoto
Protocol, with or without the USA. It must use its position in the
JUSCANZ (2) group to encourage Japan to agree to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol without the USA", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace New Zealand
climate campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi meets Mr Bush on the 30th of
June, and at that meeting he should tell the US that Japan will
move forward and ratify Kyoto without the USA. It would be
unacceptable for Japan to come to the negotiations in Bonn in two
weeks time without having made up its mind on this vital issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Sinks refers to using trees and vegetation to "soak up"
carbon dioxide. However the cause of global warming is the burning
of fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide. Unlimited use of sinks
will means that nations will not reduce their emissions from the
source of the problem, which is fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Japan, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand are a
close negotiating group within the so called "Umbrella" group.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace congratulates the Government on their commitment to sign the Stockholm Convention. The Convention requires nations to take action to eliminate the 12 dangerous chemicals known as the dirty dozen. Greenpeace now calls for real action to rid our environment of these deadly chemicals.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hon. Phil Goff has stated that New Zealand will sign the
Stockholm Convention (tonight NZ time) in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The signing of this treaty to the eliminate the dirty dozen,
which include dioxin, is a great step forward in the battle against
persistent organic pollutants (POPs). But the real work now
begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most of the dirty dozen have been banned for use in New
Zealand, however dioxins are still legally pumped into our
environment daily from industry and contaminated sites. " says Sue
Connor, Greenpeace campaigner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins are known to cause cancer, birth defects and disrupt the
hormone system of humans and animals and are one of the most
dangerous chemicals known to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The time has come to take real action to prevent ongoing dioxin
contamination in order to protect our health and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government must develop policy and law to outlaw dioxins.
This means that production processes and products, which cause
dioxins to be released, must be stopped. Clean production practices
must be implemented. And contaminated sites must also be cleaned
up".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dioxins are released in to the environment by such processes as
the incineration of waste, chlorine bleaching pulp for the
production of paper and also from dioxin contaminated sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government was due to release a public discussion document
on what needs to be done about dioxins, however this process has
been delayed according to Ministry for the Environment officials",
said Connor. "Greenpeace believes that the only way to protect New
Zealanders from deadly dioxins is to stop the dirty processes and
products which cause them in the first place".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has set up the Outlaw Dioxins Network which people
can join to receive information and have their say on dioxins
policy and law in New Zealand. People can join online at {HYPERLINK

	Greenpeace New Zealand today sandbagged Mobil HQ in Lambton Quay, Wellington, and called on Mobil to stop undermining the Kyoto Protocol.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Mobil stands out as No. 1 global warming villain. It lobbied
George W Bush to undermine the Kyoto Protocol, the only
international treaty to prevent global warming, as well as paying
over US$1 million to Bush's election campaign. When Bush entered
the White House, he tore up the Kyoto Protocol, exactly the result
Mobil was looking for", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace climate
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is calling on Mobil in New Zealand to send a clear
and strong message to its US parent company, ExxonMobil, to stop
undermining the Kyoto Protocol, start investing in renewable energy
and stop funding global warming."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas, causes global
warming. Mobil is spending around NZ$19 billion on new fossil fuel
exploration, made NZ$45 billion in profits last year, and is
lobbying to open up the pristine Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil
exploration. Mobil belongs to the American Petroleum Institute, a
US lobby group which spent around NZ$17 million on a PR campaign to
undermine the Kyoto Protocol in 1998. "All of this adds up to Mobil
funding global warming", said Connor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace delivered the sandbags to remind Mobil of the
catastrophic impacts of global warming. "Many people around the
world will have to start sandbagging against rising sea levels
caused by global warming. Mobil can now be ready for rising sea
levels if they continue to cause and fund global warming", said
Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid July the nations of the world meet in Bonn, Germany to
finalise the Kyoto Protocol, after it failed to be concluded last
November in the Hague. "The next five weeks is a critical period to
persuade Mobil to change its position on the Kyoto Protocol which
is supporting George Bush's sabotaging of global efforts to prevent
global warming", said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other organisations campaigning against Mobil include New
Zealand's Blue Greens (of the National Party), Phil Warren of
Auckland Regional Council called for a boycott of both Mobil and
Shell on 8 June, Friends of the Earth and People &amp;amp; Planet in
the UK, Pressure Point and Campaign ExxonMobil in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has created a website www.stopmobil.net so that New
Zealanders can download information, campaign materials and send a
message to Mobil to stop undermining the Kyoto Protocol, start
investing in renewable energy and stop wrecking the climate. New
Zealanders can also check out the Greenpeace New Zealand website -
www.greenpeace.org.nz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action is part of Greenpeace's global campaign to pressure
corporate America and George W Bush to work with the rest of the
world to save the climate.&lt;/p&gt;

	Tegel Foods NZ currently uses genetically engineered Soya in their animal feed. As a result of our GE Free NZ campaign KFC has recently made a commitment to go GE free but it can only do this if Tegel makes a commitment to stop using GE Soya meal in animal feed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;You can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to our cyberaction page and send protest message to the CEO

	Greenpeace activists dumped five tons of coal and five oil and nuclear waste drums outside the Vice President Cheney's residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington today to protest the Bush/Cheney Energy Plan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Activists held a banner reading "Stop the Bush/Cheney Energy
Scam: America Needs Clean Power Now." The drums were labelled with
the logos of Exxon/Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, BP and Enron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bush and Cheney have released less of a plan and more of a
scam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because it enriches the oil, coal and nuclear industries, fails
to solve the energy problems and ignores the spectre of dangerous
climate change," said Andrea Durbin, Greenpeace USA Campaigns
Director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking office, Bush has backed off a campaign promise to
control carbon emissions and has withdrawn U.S. support of the
Kyoto Protocol, the international climate change treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand government has made strong statements against the
USA abandoning the Kyoto Protocol", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace New
Zealand climate campaigner. "However, the New Zealand government
continues to belong to JUSCANZ , an international political
coalition with the USA in regard to Kyoto Protocol
negotiations".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bush's energy "scam" clearly shows that the US Government and
the US corporate fossil fuel industry don't give a damn about
preventing dangerous climate change", said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand must now work with the European Union to ensure
that the Kyoto Protocol is supported globally", said Connor. "New
Zealand must also restate its commitment to ratifying the Kyoto
Protocol by mid 2002, and support the rapid growth of renewable
energy sources, such as wind and solar in New Zealand".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace has brought John Large from the UK to New Zealand to appear before the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee hearings on the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill on May 17th. Greenpeace is making submissions in support of the Greens bill to extend New Zealand's nuclear free zone from 12 miles out to the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;John Large is an independent nuclear engineer with expertise in
the area of the risks and hazards associated with the sea transport
of nuclear materials, specifically plutonium MOX. He will be giving
evidence to the Committee on the specific risks that an accident
involving plutonium MOX fuel poses for both the health of New
Zealanders and their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Large will be suppporting Greenpeace's submission that
proposes a legal regime to protect New Zealand's EEZ from the
threat posed by the increasing number of nuclear fuel shipments
transiting the Tasman en route from Europe to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his career John has worked for a number of government
agencies including the UK Atomic Energy Authority and the Russian
Minatom as well as working with NGOs such as Greenpeace. He has
consulted on a number of accidents at sea involving nuclear
propelled and armed vessels and is currently advising the Gibraltan
authorities on the status of the UK nuclear submarine, the
Tireless, when a structural design fault forced it to dock in
Gibraltar last May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand and Australia have no off site emergency plans in
place if an accident involving the nuclear fuel shipments,
particularly a release of plutonium into the atmosphere, occurred
off our coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Large's experience with the nuclear industry spans thirty
years and covers most areas from nuclear reactor safety, through to
the transport of nuclear materials, nuclear weapons and the
decommissioning of facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Large will appear before the select committee Thursday 17th
May, 9.30 in room GOO5, Old Parliament House&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will be in Wellington till Saturday morning, and is available
for media interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

	A week after Pacific Island countries declared their unanimous support for the proposed South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, a new poll (1) shows Eastern Caribbean people also support the proposed Sanctuary by a margin of four to one.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The poll result flies in the face of Caribbean government votes
against the South Pacific sanctuary at the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) in Adelaide last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People living in the six Caribbean members of the IWC were asked
whether or not their countries should support the establishment of
a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary. The MORI poll found over half
(54%) support the Sanctuary, and only 13% oppose it (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the IWC failed to support the Sanctuary proposal,
largely because Antigua &amp;amp; Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia,
St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent &amp;amp; the Grenadines voted against
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace oceans campaigner, Bianca Havas says " Pacific Island
countries are committed to this sanctuary. This recent survey
clearly shows that Caribbean people also support it. It's now up to
the Caribbean governments to act and not bow to the power of the
Japanese aid dollar. Caribbean island states need to co- operate
with the Pacific Islands as they co-operate on other issues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MORI poll results come as Greenpeace's ship Arctic Sunrise
begins a three week tour of the Eastern Caribbean to promote
Caribbean involvement in a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
Greenpeace campaigners from the South Pacific, Japan and elsewhere
will ask the Caribbean public and governments to support Pacific
Island wishes for a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2001, the IWC will again vote on the South Pacific Whale
Sanctuary proposal. Both the South Pacific and the East Caribbean
states are under intense pressure from Japan to prevent the
sanctuary. New evidence of Japanese vote buying at the IWC -
through aid donation - emerged last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tongan MP Samiu K. Vaipulu, has recently told a Regional Forum
on a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary (3) that he had refused to
discuss "whaling and Japanese grants to Tonga" with a Japanese
delegation that visited the Kingdom last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I refused to discuss grants in the context of whaling because
the two are totally separate," Mr Vaipulu said. "Sometimes donor
countries try to tell us what to do and it is time for us to tell
them we can do it ourselves in the South Pacific."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report contains the findings of a survey conducted by MORI
(Market &amp;amp; Opinion Research International) on behalf of
Greenpeace between February and March 2001. The survey was carried
out in six counties to ascertain the views on environmental issues.
Interviews were conducted by face-to- face omnibus between 19
February and 30 March among six Eastern Caribbean nations: Antigua
(527 interviews), Dominica (501 interviews), Grenada (503
interviews), St Kitts (500 interviews), St Lucia (505 interviews),
and St Vincent (505 interviews). Any survey, which is not conducted
amongst the total population but amongst a sample drawn from the
total population, is open to certain sampling tolerances. Based on
a 95% confidence level, the margin of error for each country's
survey is about +/-4.5 percent. For further details, see
www.mori.com. (2) There was massive support of levels of eight to
one in Antigua (47% for, 7% against) and St Kitts &amp;amp; Nevis (60%
to 7%); seven to one in Dominica (66% to 9%), four to one in
Grenada (53% to 14%), and three to one in St Lucia (47% to 15%),
that their countries should support the SPWS. Even in St Vincent, a
country with whaling traditions, those supporting the vote on the
establishment of the SPWS, outnumbered those opposing it in a ratio
of 2 to 1 (51% compared to 26%). (3) The 16 countries at the
Regional Forum for a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary last week were
American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, New Caledonia, New
Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Tonga, and
Wallis and Futuna. &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace applauds the decision of Pacific Islands’ environment ministers and officials to support the progress of the proposed South Pacific Whale Sanctuary at a meeting in Samoa this weekend.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A Forum and workshop organised by the South Pacific Regional
Environmental Programme has ended with countries supporting the
proposed sanctuary, despite pressure from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member of Parliament from the Kingdom of Tonga, Honourable Samiu
K. Vaipulu, told the meeting that he had received visits from
Japanese delegations to talk about "whaling and Japanese grants to
Tonga".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I refused to discuss grants in the context of whaling because
the two are totally separate," Mr Vaipulu said. "Sometimes donor
countries try to tell us what to do and it is time for us to tell
them we can do it ourselves in the South Pacific."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Pacific campaigner, Lata Yaqona says, "other members
of the International Whaling Commission should take heed of the
views of the Pacific Island range states who want to establish a
South Pacific Whale Sanctuary. It is clear the region has a lot to
gain and nothing to lose from a sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence presented to the meeting dismissed myths circulated by
Japanese representatives that whales are in competition with
fisheries. The forum acknowledged the lack of significant
scientific evidence in the Pacific Islands region to support claims
that whales are competing for commercial fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was also attended by non-governmental organisations
and whale watching operators from Tonga, Australia and New Zealand
who discussed whale watching as a growing and viable industry
within the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whales and marine life have become a focal point for tourism in
Tonga today," said Tongan delegate Samiu Vaipulu. "The more whales
we have in our region the better the future for our children." &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed a statement from New Zealand Dairy Foods that outlined “a policy of ensuring that its products do not contain genetically modified ingredients”.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand Dairy Foods has clearly responded to the concerns
their customers have voiced over the use of GE in New Zealand
foods. This is another significant move in the global rejection of
GE foods by consumers." said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace GE
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Dairy Foods are one of the top four grocery
producing companies in New Zealand and their Anchor and
Fresh'N'Fruity brands are both among the top ten most popular
brands. (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their statement, New Zealand Dairy Foods say that, "Following
an extensive survey of our ingredient suppliers, we can confirm
that to the best of our endeavours, none of our products contain
components derived from genetic modification."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand Dairy Foods have now joined several other leading
brands in recognising that the public do not want to be part of an
experiment that could effect the environment and health of New
Zealand," said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, Unilever, Heinz-Watties, Goodman Fielder,
Cerebos Gregg's, Quality Bakers and Frucor have committed to GE
Free policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Key dairy export markets like South East Asia and Europe are
showing widespread opposition to GE. Anchor UK Ltd and New Zealand
Dairy Foods have responded to this opposition and it's time that
the NZ Dairy Board does the same" said Ms Cotter. "NZ has the
ability to capitalise on its clean green image, and export GE free
and organic produce to a large global market."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Dairy Foods decision comes as Greenpeace
continues to distribute the second version of the GE Free Food
Guide, outlines the GE status of food products and companies in New
Zealand. The guide is available on the web at
www.greenpeace.org.nz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Public demand for the GE Free Food Guide has exceeded all our
expectations. The public does want to know which food companies are
GE free and which companies are not. And in turn, this consumer
concern is sending a clear message to food companies in New
Zealand. That message is, 'We want GE Free food.'" said Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today welcomed the extension of the voluntary moratorium as a first step towards a genetic engineering (GE) free policy for New Zealand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The next step that this government needs to commit to is
banning all releases of GE into the environment. The majority of
the New Zealand public are waiting eagerly for the government's GE
free policy statement later this year," said Annette Cotter,
Greenpeace GE campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The only responsible policy from this government would be to
ensure that all releases of GE into the environment are banned and
the technology is restricted to the lab. This would include all
field trials, as any release is irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The voluntary moratorium offers a stop-gap measure to protect
the environment - the government needs to show its commitment to
the clean and green image of New Zealand and make the moratorium
into a legally binding permanent ban," said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The economics are clear - New Zealand will benefit by being GE
free. The Royal Commission on Genetic Engineering states that there
is considerable concern with the release of GE into the
environment. The public is saying yes, tangata whenua are saying
yes, farmers are saying yes, now it is time for the government to
say yes to a GE free NZ," said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

	"The export from Norway to Iceland of eight tonnes of whale meat is a cynical but clumsy attempt to force the rest of the world to restart the international trade in whale products," said John Frizell, Greenpeace Whale Campaigner.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to see how the exporter and importer will make a
profit selling in a country that already has all the whale it wants
and where the markets are brimming with locally produced lamb. This
is not a commercial transaction - this is a political gambit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An eight tonne shipment of meat and blubber equivalent to four
or five minke whales, departed Norway on July 15, 2002, and is
expected to dock soon in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Norway's exporters suggest that the moratorium on commercial
whaling has led to a shortage of whale meat in Iceland," said
Frizell, "This is not true. The Icelandic market already has more
whale meat than it can cope with provided by minke whales
accidentally caught in fishing nets." (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shipment is an attempt to undermine CITES, the
international body that regulates trade in endangered species. (2)
Norway wants to show that international trade in whale meat is
underway in the hope that CITES member countries will cave in and
legalise the trade."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Norway and Iceland have reservations to the CITES ban on
international trade in the meat of minke whales. (3) A previous
move by Norway to export whale products to Japan failed when
Japanese health authorities refused to allow import because of the
high levels of toxic chemicals found in the products and which
exceed Japanese food safety limits. These toxic and persistent
contaminants accumulate in whales over their lifetime because they
are near the top of the food chain. (4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal has been submitted to CITES to end the ban on
international trade in minke whale meat and is strongly supported
by Norway and Iceland. CITES will consider the proposal at a
meeting in Santiago, Chile from November three to 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) It is estimated that between 15 and 25 minke whales are
caught as bycatch in Icelandic fisheries every year and sold on the
Icelandic market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) sets controls on the international
trade and movement of animal and plant species that have been, or
may be, threatened due to excessive commercial exploitation. Such
species are identified by the Parties and listed in one of three
appendices to the Convention, according to the level of control
required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Norway's actions undermines a 16 year old moratorium on
commercial whaling set by the International Whaling Commission.
Although Norway is a member of the IWC it objected to the
moratorium and is not legally bound by it. Iceland left the IWC in
1992 in protest at the continuing application of the moratorium. At
this year's IWC 54th Annual Meeting, Iceland tried to rejoin with a
reservation to the moratorium, but was rejected by the
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and Norway have been discussing a resumption in whale
trade following Norway's decision in January 2001 to lift its ban
on whale exports. The Fisheries Agency of Japan applied to the
Trade Ministry for permission to import whale meat from Norway, but
as yet no shipments have been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) A report in the British magazine, New Scientist (June 2,
2002), said that whale meat contains "astonishing" levels of
mercury that "have even surprised the experts," with a single
mouthful potentially enough to cause brain damage or harm pregnant
mothers' unborn children. In addition, a report released on May 7,
2002 by Greenpeace revealed that whale blubber stored in Norway
awaiting export to Japan is unfit for human consumption. The report
written by independent scientists in Germany concludes that the
samples analysed are contaminated with various halogenated-organic
contaminants such as PCBs, DDT, and brominated flame retardants.

	A rally in Auckland calling on the government to keep genetic engineering in the lab and not released into the environment, has brought together many diverse individuals and community groups.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The Auckland GE Free Coalition rally has provided the public
with an opportunity to show their concerns about GE in our
environment. The call for a GE free NZ is something the government
cannot ignore," says GE Free Coalition spokesperson, Annette
Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Royal Commission into Genetic Engineering (RCI) has failed
to reflect the overwhelming scientific evidence and public
opposition to GE in the environment in their recommendations. It is
now up to the Government to ban any further GE releases," says
Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alannah Currie of Thomson Twin fame, and co- ordinator of
Artists for a GE free New Zealand, says "we (artists) have rallied
together asking that the Government to see reason and ban GE from
our environment. The future is organic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangata Whenua have joined the rally concerned the RCI
recommendations have paid only lip service to Maori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Maori sovereignty and the Treaty of Waitangi are inextricably
link and the RCI recommendations have fail to acknowledge this,"
says Nga Wahine Tiaki o Tea o spokesperson Donna Ngaronoa Gardiner
"Public sentiment has already resulted in considerable commitments
by food producers. Companies like Tegel have statistics showing
that 75 percent of consumers are supportive of their GE free
commitment. We expect this rally will encourage more food producers
to go GE free," says Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speakers at the rally include: Dr Peter Wills (Theoretical
Biologist), Kay Baxter (Horticulturist), Brendan Hoare (President
of the Soil and Health Association), Del Wihongi and Leone Pihama
(Nga Wahine Tiaki o Te Ao), Percy Tipene (Te Waka Kai Ora), Donna
Gardiner, and Annette Cotter (Greenpeace) who is also the Auckland
GE Free Coalition spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalls and costumed entertainment will also be on hand to
entertain the kids while the speakers address the rally.
International eyes are also on New Zealand with many countries keen
that New Zealand prohibits GE release into the environment. The
Prime Ministers of Bangladesh and Malaysia have written to Helen
Clark, and GE Free New Zealand rallies have occurred in Sydney,
Australia, England, Canada and San Paulo, Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;

	British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) plutonium ship’s have breached Solomon’s and Vanuatu Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) at approximately NZ4:30pm, Greenpeace revealed today.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ships are close to Rennel Island within the Solomon's EEZ
and Torres and Espiritu Santo Islands just within the Vanuatu EEZ.
This puts the ships on a course to transit through the EEZ of New
Caledonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vanuatu Deputy Prime Minister Serge Vohor is reported to be
upset at the breach of his country's EEZ and the lack of
consultation (1). The Vanuatu Prime Minister is preparing a
statement for presentation at the African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) Summit in Nadi tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships were found at 12 degrees 19.8 minutes S, 163 degrees
14.2 minutes E on a bearing of 190 degrees magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Nuclear Fuels has ludicrously called Greenpeace
irresponsible for publicising the location of the this dangerous
shipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is BNFL acting irresponsibly. They have not fulfilled their
obligations under the Law of the Sea. They have failed to inform
en-route nations, and have failed to provide Environmental Impact
Assessments and emergency plans (2),"said Ange Heffernan,
Greenpeace Pacific Nuclear Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two British flagged nuclear freighters carrying 255kg of
weapons- useable plutonium breached the EEZ of the Federated States
of Micronesia on Saturday July 13, despite the FSM Government's
stated opposition. Greenpeace, using a small aircraft, found the
ships at 08 degrees 10 minutes N, 158 degrees 44 minutes E sailing
on a bearing of 157 degrees magnetic - only 40 nautical miles from
the FSM capital, Pohnpei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace also believes the Pacific Teal and Pacific Pintail
breached the EEZ of the Republic of Marshall Islands on Friday July
12. Calculations based on the path and speed of the ships puts
their location at 15:00 hrs local time at approximately 11 degrees
30 minutes north, 158 degrees 05 minutes east - putting them about
150 miles off Ujelang Atoll in RMI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Free Pacific Flotilla yachts, which left in the last
week from Vanuatu, New Zealand and Australia, are closing in on
their destination in the Tasman Sea. They are gathering to "bear
witness" as the plutonium ships move past. The Flotilla is made up
of individual boat owners - with crews onboard ranging in age from
three to over 60 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) 17/07/2002 08:11:08 | ABC Radio Australia News&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Under international law BNFL is obligated to inform all en-
route nations of their route and to provide environmental impact
assessments given the dangerous nature of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace welcomes Restaurant Brands New Zealand Limited (1) announcement in its 2000 Annual Report that it will be working with its suppliers to eliminate any remaining genetically engineered material from all its ingredients and animal feed by 1 December 2001.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"This is a major coup for consumers of Kentucky Fried Chicken,
Pizza Hut, and Starbucks, who want to eat GE free food," said
Annette Cotter, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Restaurant Brands Annual Report, Chief Executive Jim Collier
revealed that the company has been working in collaboration with
its many suppliers to eliminate GE ingredients from its products
and animal feed used by its suppliers. Restaurant Brands is working
towards the elimination of GE material from its ingredients by 1
December ahead of mandatory labelling of packaged food by ANZFA on
7 December 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Restaurant Brands has obviously listened to its consumers and
noted the growing trend of companies in Europe going GE free. We
would also like to see Tegel NZ Limited who supply KFC with chicken
to make a similar commitment and source GE free soya meal for its
animal feed," said Cotter (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months Greenpeace has been campaigning
for KFC and Tegel to go GE free as part of the Rainbow Warrior, GE
free future tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurant Banks New Zealand Limited operate the New Zealand
outlets of Pizza Hut, KFC and Starbucks Coffee. Independent tests
on the soya meal used in Tegel's animal feed confirm it is
contaminated with Monsanto's Round-up Ready Soy.&lt;/p&gt;

	Manners mall: Greenpeace activists took to street theatre today with a caricature of George W Bush melting an ice sculpture of planet earth with a blowtorch, to highlight Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The USA is the largest single greenhouse gas emitter in the
world, yet Bush, with urging from his fossil fuel backers, such as
Mobil, has turned his back on the Kyoto Protocol", said Sue Connor,
Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The final outcome from the G8 Heads of Government meeting has
failed to protect the global climate. All G8 nations acknowledged
the need to reduce greenhouse gases, but did not resolve
differences about the Kyoto Protocol."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments are meeting right now to finalise the Kyoto
Protocol. The Whitehouse announced in March this year that the USA
did not intend to honour the Protocol. Australia and Canada have
used the USA's backslide as an excuse to try to slide out of their
obligations as a citizen in a global warming world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is an agreement on the table in Bonn now which if
accepted will allow nations to begin the process of ratification to
begin. We know that 3 nations from the 'Umbrella Group', which
includes Japan, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway,
have accepted the agreement. It remains to be seen if New Zealand
has accepted it yet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has stated that it will ratify the Kyoto Protocol by
mid 2002. Greenpeace is urging the government to firmly stick to
this target and do everything in its power to encourage Australia
and Canada to stop playing into Bush's game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Australia and Canada, along with Japan are using Bush's
rejection of the Protocol to wreck the negotiations and destroy the
Protocol's environmental integrity. They are trying to avoid
reducing greenhouse gases at the source, (burning fossil fuels), by
arguing for elaborate mechanisms to count carbon which is soaked up
by trees, plants and soils as reducing carbon dioxide".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The reality is the major cause of global warming is burning
fossil fuels. The answer to global warming is simple, we must phase
out fossil fuels and phase in renewable energy such as wind, solar
and hydrogen fuel technologies. The first step to achieving a phase
out of fossil fuels is to introduce binding greenhouse gas
reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, 2,500 of the
world's leading climate scientists, have confirmed that global
warming is happening now and that burning fossil fuels are the
major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wellingtonians are invited to Manners mall to sign a letter
calling on the New Zealand Government to stay strong and ratify the
Protocol. Greenpeace will deliver the letters to the Government on
behalf of all people sending letters. People can also send a letter
to the government from www.greenpeace.org.nz.&lt;/p&gt;

	Federated States of Micronesia: British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) plutonium ships’ breached the Federated States of Micronesia’s 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at 9:50 this morning (FSM time) against that nations’ stated wishes, Greenpeace revealed today. The shipment of reject plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel is in transit between Japan and the United Kingdom.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace today witnessed the Governments of Japan and UK
arrogantly disregard the legitimate call by a Pacific sovereign
nation to keep out of their Exclusive Economic Zone," said Simon
Boxer, Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The irresponsibility and arrogance of sending this dangerous
shipment through the Pacific by Japan and the UK must not go
unpunished. Legal redress can and should be sought through the
international courts by all en-route nations especially in the
Pacific to prohibit this unjustifiable trade."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace predicts that over the next ten days the ships will
breach other Pacific Island Nations EEZs despite their
opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships were spotted seven miles apart, 08 degrees ten minutes
north a hundred and 58 degrees 44 minutes east, on a bearing of 157
magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These breaches are also occurring in contravention of the
requirements of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flotilla of twelve yachts, which left on Sunday 7 July, are
sailing into the Tasman Sea to protest against the shipment. The
yachts from Australia, New Zealand and Vanuatu, will gather next
week in the northern Tasman Sea and wait for the two ships as they
pass through the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two UK lightly armed nuclear freighters, the Pacific Pintail and
Pacific Teal carrying the cargo of faulty MOX, including 255 kgs of
weapons-usable plutonium, left Japan on Thursday. The shipment of
faulty MOX is being returned to the UK because its producers, the
government-owned British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), falsified critical
safety data on the fuel and the Japanese refused to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea says, which
stipulates the shipping nations have legal obligations to engage in
meaningful consultation on matters such as emergency contingency
plans and to conduct an environmental impact assessment and should
include detailed routing and timing information to the emergency
and marine safety authorities of each en route state.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace welcomed today's announcement that Tegel company in New Zealand is now sourcing their chicken feed from non genetically engineered crops. Tegel is responsible for importing 50 000 tonnes of soy bean meal from the US into NZ, to feed its chickens. During the past year thousands of people in New Zealand have sent postcards, emails and letters calling on Tegel to “not be chicken, and to go GE free”. Today's response by Tegel is a clear indication that the future of the market place is in GE free products.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Tegel have recognised the public rejection of GE, and have
responded accordingly. This is a victory for public opinion and
reinforces the necessity for New Zealand to be GE free in our
environment and food chain," said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace
campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been campaigning to get Tegel to source GE free
soy meal for their chicken feed for over 12 months. Crew of the
Greenpeace Flagship the Rainbow Warrior took action against Tegel
and their major customer KFC during the summer. As a result KFC
made a commitment to go GE free earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tegel, the largest company selling chickens, is leading the way
for the poultry industry and should be congratulated for their GE
free stance. Tegel has around 60 percent of the market share and an
annual turnover exceeding NZ$60M. Inghams and other poultry
producers should follow this lead and make a GE free commitment
also," said Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is calling on the New Zealand government to follow
the example set by Tegel in listening to the people of New Zealand
and ensure that our environment remains free from GE contamination.
Tegel's own statistics show that 75 percent of consumers are
supportive of their GE free commitment. GE is simply not wanted by
a clear majority of New Zealanders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tegel joins a wave of companies both in New Zealand and in
Europe that have listened to their customers and made a GE free
commitment. Other companies who have also done so include, Heinz
Watties, Cerebos Greggs, and Unilever.&lt;/p&gt;

	Rain and cold failed to deter GE-free marchers in the biggest public rally seen in New Zealand for 20 years.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The "Keep New Zealand GE Free" rally in Auckland, attended by at
least 10,000 people, stretched from QE2 to Aotea Square, was awash
with colourful GE Free banners, costumes and placards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The overwhelming success of this rally has sent a very clear
message to the Government. People of this country want a GE free
environment and food chain. Keep GE in the lab," said Auckland GE
free Coalition spokesperson Annette Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The march started in QE 2 square and ended in Aotea square where
the crowd listened to speeches by members of the Auckland GE Free
Coalition. The crowd were urged to 'get- active', write to MPs, and
declare their homes and communities GE free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The mobilisation of such a large number of people, from so many
walks of life calling for a GE-free New Zealand cannot be ignored
by the Government. The Labour Alliance government must keep NZ GE
free," said Ms Cotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance Party announced yesterday it wanted to extend the
moratorium on field trials until they could be proved to be
safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Marchers from Wellington to Kaitaia and as far a field as
Wanaka attended the Auckland Rally. Activities are also occurring
all around the country as communities and local governments say yes
to a GE free NZ," said Cotter. &lt;/p&gt;

	DUNEDIN, TOUR UPDATE

Greenpeace has been delighted with the response to its Eliminate Dioxin Drive in Dunedin.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The drive is highlighting the extent of dangerous dioxin
pollution around New Zealand and is calling on the government to
eliminate dioxins in the build-up to an international meeting in
December. At present New Zealand is one of only a handful of
nations to refuse to aim to eliminate dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The majority of nations of the world have agreed to aim to
eliminate dioxins, said Sue Connor Greenpeace toxics campaigner.
"Why is the New Zealand government not willing to stand up and
protect New Zealanders health, environment and future generations
from dangerous dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Toxics Campaigner, Sue Connor said she also welcomed
meeting with Dunedin mayor, Sukhi Turner. The council operated
Wastewater Solids Incinerator, the only such incinerator in the
country, is amongst the 40 dioxin polluting sites featured on
Greenpeace's Toxics Map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday 6 October, Greenpeace held a colourful stand which
drew a steady stream of visitors at Otago University and again on
Saturday in the Octagon. People lined up to sign bright orange
"toxic" barrels calling for the New Zealand government to commit to
a dioxin free future for New Zealand. People of Dunedin sent
postcards to the Minister for the Environment and letters to their
Member of Parliament. The spread of dioxin pollution is graphically
captured on Greenpeace's just launched Toxics Map with visitors
encouraged to check it out on www.greenpeace.org.nz/toxics-map
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to protect New Zealanders health, environment and
future generations is to eliminate dangerous dioxins.&lt;/p&gt;

	Statements made today by Bas Walker the head of ERMA that “at no stage have we said categorically there was no contamination” directly contradict the lines being peddled by Helen Clark and Marian Hobbs since information of the release of GE corn was revealed in Seeds of Distrust on Wednesday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mr Walker stated on Checkpoint on National Radio this evening
that "at no stage have we said categorically there was no
contamination".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helen Clark on Checkpoint on National Radio on 10th July stated
"there was no GM proven in the seeds". She also stated in the
Dominion Post on 11th July "extensive testing could not find any
evidence of GM presence in those plants".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marian Hobbs press release on Wednesday 10th July states, "It
cannot be claimed therefore that GM material was released …" and
she maintained that position on 3 News last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What is going on? Either ERMA is not talking to the Government
or the Government is ignoring it's own regulatory body and is still
covering up the whole incident," said Annette Cotter, Greenpeace
spokesperson today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Walker confirmed that Dr Donald Hannah considered the full
range of test results when he made his report to Government, and
stated "there was no other written analysis of the test beyond
[Donald Hannah's] memorandum" and confirmed there was no further
testing. Mr Walker also confirmed that Dr Hannah's report was "the
final scientific comment".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How then can the Government continue to deny that it knew the
corn was GE contaminated? Dr Hannah's "final scientific comment"
was that there was "less than 0.5 percent GM contamination"11
Evaluation of Information Received for Novartis Jubilee Sweetcorn
Lot NC9114, Donald Hannah, Manager, Science and Research, 5th
December 2000..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He never concluded that the corn was not contaminated, only
that the level of contamination came under the Government's
judiciously selected allowable threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To conclude from these results that there was no GE
contamination is like saying that tests show we only have chickens
when results show that we have ninety nine chickens and one
fox."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Hannah looked at the positive test results and determined
that lab error resulting in 'false positives' was unlikely because
the labs ran identical tests on 'controls' (seeds known to be GE
free). These registered negative while the Lot NC9114 seeds
registered positive. He also concluded that the contaminant was
likely to be a GE variety Bt11. &lt;/p&gt;

	Auckland/Vandenberg Airforce Base, Lompoc, California: Just 48 hours before George Bush's Star Wars missile test, the full might of the US military has been brought to bear on a single Greenpeace activist, camped out on a tiny Pacific island close to the launch pad of the "kill vehicle" of the Star Wars system.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a desperate attempt to suppress legitimate protest over the
development of the missile programme, US officials have pressured
the Marshall Island authorities to issue an arrest warrant and
deportation order for Australian Richard "Alice" Leney. US and
Marshallese officials have acknowledged that Leney has not been
breaking any laws by camping out on the island with the permission
of local landowners, but will hold him in jail until Monday when he
will be taken to court. He has spent two months on his own and has
been observing the preparations for the test on nearby Meck Island,
where the interceptor missile is due to be launched on
Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"George Bush has already made it obvious he is not interested in
consulting with friends and allies over the implementation of the
Star Wars programme. Now he is sending a clear signal that he also
wants to suppress peaceful and legitimate protest of the test on
Saturday," said Greenpeace International disarmament campaigner
William Peden. "Alice Leney has done nothing wrong - even the US
authorities admit that. George Bush wants to shut down any
opposition to Star Wars - from his political allies right down to
one man in a tent," Peden added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening the sixth Star Wars missile test is due.
Kwajalien atoll in Marshall Islands is the US base from which the
interceptor missile is launched following the launch of a rocket
from Vandenberg airbase in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marshall Islands authorities have come under increasing
pressure from the US government to arrest Leney since his camp was
established following the departure of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow
Warrior two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The implementation of Star Wars will prompt a new nuclear arms
race. If George Bush thinks we will be deterred from our opposition
to the programme simply because he has adopted bully boy tactics
against one peaceful protestor he is mistaken. We will continue to
oppose his plan until Star Wars is stopped, " Peden added&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists from around the world will be gathering at
Vandenberg Airforce Base in California on Friday to begin a protest
against the test which is due on Saturday evening (PDT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest will continue throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

	Four Greenpeace activists last night (NZ time) boarded a tanker chartered by US oil company ExxonMobil (known as Esso in parts of Europe) in the Italian port of Vado Ligure.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The action comes at the beginning of the renewed climate talks
in Bonn and 3 days before the G-8 government leaders are due to
meet in Genoa which will discuss both the climate treaty and the
recently released G-8 renewable energy task force report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the world meets in Bonn to discuss the Kyoto climate treaty,
George Bush, with the backing of the US oil industry is threatening
to wreck international plans to protect the climate," said Paul
Horsman, Greenpeace International Climate campaigner. "Further, the
US is opposing the G-8 initiative which could bring renewable
energy to up to 1 billion of the world's poorest."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobil is one of the major oil companies that has consistently
opposed plans to protect the climate and questioned the scientific
consensus on global warming and is not investing in any renewable
energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In refusing to ratify the Kyoto treaty, George Bush is doing
what his oil industry backers have wanted," said Sue Connor,
Greenpeace New Zealand Climate campaigner. "However the world
cannot wait for Bush. The governments meeting in Genoa and in Bonn
should agree to ratify Kyoto with or without the US."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the US is not serious about protecting the climate,
other world's leaders should demonstrate that they will go ahead
and ratify the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace congratulates New Zealand’s firm no nuclear stance as governments flesh out the rules of the Kyoto Protocol.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pro-nuclear countries, led by Canada, Australia and Japan, have
now made inclusion of nuclear power in the Protocol one of their
key demands. "A small group of pro-nuclear countries are
frustrating the majority of governments who want to exclude nuclear
power from the Kyoto Protocol", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace New
Zealand campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand favours the negotiating text which excludes nuclear
energy, thereby opposing nukes in the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is welcome turn around as New Zealand has failed in recent
years to oppose proposals by other countries to promote nuclear
energy under the Kyoto Protocol", said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The overwhelming majority wanted to see nuclear power out of
the Kyoto Protocol so they must not give in to the pro-nuclear
minority. If they do, the environmental integrity of the protocol
will be fundamentally undermined".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many problems associated with nuclear power - production of
radioactive waste, vulnerability to catastrophic accidents, high
costs and nuclear proliferation, mean it cannot be part of a
sustainable energy future. "The Kyoto Protocol must not subsidise
nuclear technology, because it diverts scarce resources away from
climate change solutions, renewable energy and energy
efficiency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is a member of the JUSCANZ group, which includes
Japan, Canada and Australia. "The fact that these nations are
promoting nuclear energy and stalling, along with the USA, on a
commitment to ratification, makes New Zealand's continued
involvement in this group untenable".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today called for field trials to be included in any moratorium, while supporting the cautious approach outlined by the Prime Minister regarding NZ’s policy on genetic engineering.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The line must be drawn at the laboratory door. Any release into
the environment will lead to contamination. Examples here and
overseas show that genetic material cannot be contained in field
trials. Therefore it is critical to ensure that the Government
position halts all releases into the environment," said Annette
Cotter, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tasmania, there have been 21 documented breaches of GE field
trials (1), and in New Zealand field trials of genetically
engineered peas, potatoes, salmon and tamarillos have had
containment breaches. (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government is responding to the uncertainty and concerns
raised by the Royal Commission's report. In acknowledging that our
clean green image cannot be compromised, Ms Clark is assuming a
sensible approach to GE," said Cotter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Keeping options open by keeping GE in the lab is a pragmatic
position to take. Lab based research can continue with our
environment being GE free. This is the best of both worlds."&lt;/p&gt;

	Reports from Bonn say that Japan may be weakening its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, by stating that there will be no progress at the climate meeting which started in Bonn last night (NZ time).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Protocol can enter into force without the US if Japan
ratifies, making up the 55 percent of countries needed to meet the
requirements for the Protocol to enter into force. However, this
will not happen at this meeting without Japan 's clear commitment
to ratify the Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's environmental credibility is at risk unless it makes a
commitment to ratify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Koizumi has recently bowed to US
pressure by saying that he will work "to the last minute" to
persuade Mr. Bush to rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, rather than making
a commitment to ratifying the Protocol now", said Bill Hare,
Greenpeace International policy director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Japan cannot hide behind its self-appointed "peacemaker"
stance. There is no peace to be made - Bush has said he rejects the
Protocol, effectively making Japan the country which will make or
break it", said Hare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On the one hand Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Koizumi has said
that Japan will continue to negotiate in good faith. Yet now he has
said that there will be no progress at these crucial talks before
they have even started. With every passing day, Japan's credibility
falls further and further", said Hare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has already signaled its intention to ratify the
Protocol. "Japan is one of New Zealand's negotiating allies in
these climate talks, and therefore Japan's lack of commitment
undermines New Zealand's commitment to the Protocol. The New
Zealand government must urge Japan to stop putting the global
climate at risk and join New Zealand and the EU in the commitment
to ratify", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has installed a six metre high inflatable planet
earth outside the conference surrounded by 24 televisions screening
testimonies about climate change from several hundred people from
around the world. Greenpeace wants to bring the voices of the
people affected by the devastating impacts of global warming into
the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is undertaking a rolling protest at South Auckland Mobil service stations as part of the international day of action.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace is protesting today at Mobil service stations to let
the New Zealand public know that Mobil is global warming villain
No.1", said Sue Connor, Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mobil urged George Bush to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol,
the only international treaty to prevent dangerous global warming.
As soon as Bush entered the Whitehouse, he tore up the Protocol,
exactly what Mobil wanted".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mobil in New Zealand must send an urgent message to ExxonMobil
in the USA to stop undermining the Kyoto Protocol and stop fueling
global warming", said Connor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2,500 of
the worlds global warming experts, have said that global warming is
happening now. The IPCC identified the burning of fossil fuels
which release billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere every year as a major cause of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mobil is the largest fossil fuel company in the world. It
funded George Bush's election campaign over $NZ 2.5 million. It
made $NZ45 billion in profits last year, is spending $NZ 17 billion
on new fossil fuel exploration but is not investing in renewable
energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If any company can afford to invest in preventing global
warming its Mobil. However it carries on raking in the profits from
fossil fuels, while denying the reality that global warming is
happening now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Global warming threatens the very existence of some low lying
Pacific Islands. At least two small islands, Tebuatarawa in
Kiribati and Tepuka Sevilivili in Tuvalu, have already disappeared
beneath the sea. The Ministry for the Environment is about to
release a climate impacts report which shows almost all sectors of
New Zealand will be affected by global warming".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace congratulates the New Zealand Government for donating funds to the United Nations programme to eliminate deadly chemicals, but reminded Hon. Marian Hobbs that dioxins are still legally being pumped into the New Zealand environment every single day.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It is great that New Zealand is paying towards the
international effort to eliminate persistent organic pollutants
(POPs), such as dioxins, DDT and dieldrin, however international
efforts must not replace action in New Zealand to stop toxic
pollution", said Sue Connor Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May this year, New Zealand signed an international treaty,
(the Stockholm Convention) which requires all parties to aim to
eliminate twelve deadly chemicals, including dioxins from the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present the Government's draft policy is to aim to reduce
dioxins and will ask New Zealanders, in September, for their
opinion on this policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace believes there can be only one answer and that is to
OUTLAW dioxins, which means all production processes and products
which cause dioxins must be banned."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many sources of dioxins around New Zealand, including
hazardous, medical and quarantine waste incinerators, dioxin
contaminated sites from the treatment of timber, chlorine bleaching
of pulp &amp;amp; paper by Carter Holt Harvey's Kawerau and Tokoroa
pulp mills. Other potential sources include alleged dumping by Dow
of chemicals around New Plymouth. Recently the dioxin contaminated
chemical 245-T was found to be leaking onto the shoreline from an
old Dow landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government released a report earlier this year stating that
up to 1 in 1000 New Zealanders could be dying from cancer caused by
dioxin contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This doesn't take into account the other serious health impacts
on New Zealanders from dioxin contamination, such as birth defects,
endometriosis, impaired development of children and diabetes".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government must implement the Stockholm Convention and
outlaw dioxins". New Zealanders can join the Outlaw Dioxins Network
by going to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/outlawdioxinsnz &lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace activists on the streets are drawing attention to Mobil's (1) regressive attitude towards the greatest environmental threat the planet faces, global warming.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Thursday and today Greenpeace has peacefully protested
at Mobil service stations, giving the message to pedestrians and
motorists that 'Mobil + Bush = Global Warming'. "Greenpeace will
continue to take this campaign to the streets to make sure that New
Zealanders learn the facts about Mobil", said Sue Connor,
Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mobil stands out as the worst global climate wrecking fossil
fuel corporate in the world. Mobil funded George W Bush's election
campaign to the tune of over US$1 million, and lobbied him to pull
out of the Kyoto Protocol. As soon as Bush got into power he tore
up the Kyoto Protocol, the only international treaty to prevent
global warming. This was exactly what Mobil was seeking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobil is actively undermining the science of global warming, to
the extent that they have funded scientists who are sceptical about
global warming (2) and continue to push the theory that burning
fossil fuels does not cause global warming. This is despite advice
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2,500 of
the climate experts that indeed global is happening and it is
mainly caused by burning fossil fuels which releases the greenhouse
gas, carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On top of all of this, Mobil made NZ$45 billion in profits last
year, is pouring NZ$17 billion into new fossil fuel exploration,
but is not investing in new renewable energy such as wind and
solar. Mobil's behaviour is tantamount to funding and fuelling
global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is quite ironic that Mobil's latest catch phrase, "a whole
new generation of fuels" creates the impression that its fossil
fuels are good for New Zealand and future generations. On the
contrary burning fossil fuels cause global warming".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealanders can join the campaign by logging into
www.stopmobil .net and sending a message to tell Mobil that New
Zealanders don't want global warming, and to stop undermining the
Kyoto Protocol and stop funding global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Mobil is known in the United States as Exxon Mobil and in
Europe as Esso&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) It was revealed recently on the current affairs programme,

Singer&lt;/p&gt;
